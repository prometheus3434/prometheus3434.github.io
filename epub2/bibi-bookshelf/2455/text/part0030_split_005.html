The pieces by Franklin, along with annotations about the affair and Dickinson’s presumed authorship of the essays attributed to him, are in Papers 2:27–91. Franklin’s fascinating battle over Hemphill has been recounted in many good historical studies, from which this section draws: Bryan LeBeau, “Franklin and the Presbyterians,” <span class="italic"><span>Early American Review</span></span> (summer 1996), earlyamerica.com/review/summer/franklin/; Merton Christensen, “Franklin on the Hemphill Trial: Deism versus Presbyterian Orthodoxy,” <span class="italic"><span>William and Mary Quarterly</span></span> (July 1953): 422–40; William Barker, “The Hemphill Case, Benjamin Franklin and Subscription to the Westminster Confession,” <span class="italic"><span>American Presbyterians</span></span> 69 (winter 1991); Aldridge <span class="italic"><span>Nature,</span></span> 86–98; Buxbaum 93–104.</span></p>

The editors of the Yale Papers do not include the Obadiah Plainman letters as Franklin’s. But Leo Lemay convincingly argues that he wrote them, and he included them in the Library of America collection. Likewise, it seems possible that Franklin, as was his wont, stoked the controversy by writing the opposing letters from “Tom Trueman.”</span></p>

<p class="endnote"><span>In addition to half-seriously trying to fix Sally up with Strahan’s son Billy, Franklin hoped his son, William, would marry Polly Stevenson, the daughter of his London landlady; that his grandson William Temple Franklin would marry the son of his Paris lady friend Mme. Brillon; and that Sally’s son Benjamin Bache would marry Polly Stevenson’s daughter. A harsher assessment of Franklin’s treatment of Sally and the education he provided her can be found in an essay by Larry Tise, “Liberty and the Rights of Women,” in the collection he edited, <span class="italic"><span>Benjamin Franklin and Women</span></span> (University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press, 2000), 37–49.</span></p>

Franklin revealed his authorship in about 1778 at a dinner with the Abbé Raynal in Paris, where the authenticity of the famous speech was being debated. Franklin told the group, “I am going to set you straight. When I was young and printed a newspaper, it sometimes happened, when I was short of material to fill my sheet, that I amused myself by making up stories, and that of Polly Baker is one of the number.” Papers 3:121–22.</span></p>

Carter III, <span class="italic"><span>One Grand Pursuit</span></span> (Philadelphia: American Philosophical Society, 1993); American Philosophical Society, www.amphilsoc.org.</span></p>
<p class="endnote"><span>Franklin had a love for writing very detailed charters, rules, and procedures for organizations. Among the groups he did this for were the Junto, Masonic lodge, fire company, police patrol, American Philosophical Society, Pennsylvania militia, Academy, postal service, and society for the abolition of slavery. This penchant also helped him draw up the Albany plan for union, the discipline regulations for the colonial army, and the first proposed articles of confederation.</span></p>

<p class="endnote"><span>The year he retired, Franklin wrote and published an essay called “Advice to a Young Tradesman, Written by an Old One,” in which he restated much of the philosophy of Poor Richard and the Autobiography: “The way to wealth, if you desire it, is as plain as the way to market. It depends chiefly on two words, Industry and Frugality; i.e., waste neither time nor money, but make the best use of both.” Papers 3:304.</span></p>
<p id="ch_5_en_26" class="endnote"><span><a href="part0011.html#ch_5_een_26">26</a>. Gordon S. Wood, <span class="italic"><span>The Radicalism of the American Revolution</span></span> (New York: Random House, 1991), 77, 85–86, 199. I tend to disagree with Wood’s thesis to the extent that he portrays Franklin as a man of aristocratic aspirations whose leather-apron image was mainly affected after his social ambitions were dashed. The evidence in favor of giving more weight than Wood does to the view of Franklin as a proud member of the middle class is, I hope, detailed throughout this book. Even during the period right after his retirement, which Wood says was the prime period of his “aristocratic” aspirations, Franklin’s politics remained rather populist and his civic endeavors had a common touch. Nevertheless, Wood provides an interesting assessment that merits consideration as a counterpoint to the approach taken by other historians. And because Wood contends that Franklin’s aristocratic attitude was manifest primarily during the period from 1748 to the late 1760s (plus when he advocated at the Constitutional Convention that officeholders serve without pay), his thesis can be given weight without entirely rejecting the view that for most of his life Franklin was, as he claimed, a proud part of “we, the middling people.” Wood also uses a somewhat broader definition of aristocracy than others do; he includes in it not only titled nobility and hereditary classes but also wealthy commoners who hold themselves out to be gentlemen. Wood’s thesis reminds us, correctly I think, that one of Franklin’s goals, beginning with his creation of the lending library, was to help members of the middling class take on some of the qualities of the enlightened gentry. (It should also be noted that the classical definition of aristocracy denoted a system of rule by the best, rather than a hereditary class system of social hierarchy and titles based on birth, which is what the term came to mean in England by Franklin’s time.)</span></p>
