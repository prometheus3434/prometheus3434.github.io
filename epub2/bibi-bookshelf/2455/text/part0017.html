<h3 class="chapterHeadA">The Vacations of 1771</h3>
<p class="para"><span>As the summer of 1771 approached, Franklin decided to forsake the world of public affairs for the time being. He had been stymied, at least for the moment, in all of his political missions: the fight against the Proprietors and then Parliament, his pursuit of a land grant and a royal appointment. But he was still not ready to return home. So, instead, he escaped the pressures of politics in the manner he loved best, by taking an extended series of trips that lasted until the end of the year: to England’s industrial midland and north in May, to a friend’s estate in southern England in June and again in August, and then to Ireland and Scotland in the fall.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>On his rambles in May, Franklin visited the village of Clapham, where there was a large pond. It was a windy day and the water was rough, so he decided to test his theories about the calming effect of oil. Using just a teaspoon, he watched in amazement as it “produced an instant calm” that extended gradually to make a “quarter of the pond, perhaps half an acre, as smooth as a looking glass.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Although Franklin would continue to study the effect of oil on water seriously, he also found ways to have fun by turning it into a conjuring trick. “After this, I contrived to take with me, whenever I went into the country, a little oil in the upper hollow joint of my bamboo cane,” he wrote. On a visit to the house of Lord Shelburne, he was walking by a stream with a group of friends, including the great actor David Garrick and the visiting French philosopher the Abbé Morellet, and told them he could still the waves. He walked upstream, waved his cane three times, and the surface of the stream calmed. Only later did he show off his cane and explain the magic.<a href="part0030_split_011.html#ch_11_en_1" id="ch_11_een_1"><sup class="calibre7">1</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>His tour of midland and north England in the company of two fellow scientists gave Franklin the chance to study the Industrial Revolution that was booming there. He visited an iron and tin factory in Rotherham, the metal casting shops of Birmingham, and a silk mill in Derby where 63,700 reels were turning constantly “and the twist process is tended by children of about 5 to 7 years old.” In Manchester, he “embarked in a luxurious horse-drawn boat” owned by the Duke of Bridgewater that, befitting the peer’s name, took him onto an aqueduct that crossed a river before ending in a coal mine. Near Leeds they called on the scientist Joseph Priestley, “who made some very pretty electrical experiments” for them and then described the various gases he had been discovering.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin had denounced England’s mercantile trading laws, which were designed to suppress manufacturing in her colonies, by arguing (a bit disingenuously) that she would never have to fear that America would become an industrial competitor. In his letters from his tour in 1771, however, he sent detailed advice about creating silk, clothing, and metal industries that would make the colonies self-sufficient. He had become “more and more convinced,” he wrote his Massachusetts friend Thomas Cushing, of the “impossibility” that England would be able to keep up with America’s growing demand for clothing. “Necessity therefore, as well as prudence, will soon induce us to seek resources in our own industry.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin returned to London briefly in early June “in time to be at Court for the King’s birthday,” he wrote Deborah. Despite his disagreements with Parliament’s taxation policies, he was still a loyal supporter of George III. “While we are declining the usurped authority of Parliament,” he wrote Cushing that week, “I wish to see a steady dutiful attachment to the King and his family maintained among us.”<a href="part0030_split_011.html#ch_11_en_2" id="ch_11_een_2"><sup class="calibre7">2</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>After a fortnight in London, Franklin headed to the south of England, where he visited his friend Jonathan Shipley at his Tudor manor in Twyford, just outside Winchester. Shipley was an Anglican bishop in Wales, but he spent most of his time in Twyford with his wife and five spirited daughters. It was such a delightful visit (Franklin might well have defined delight as an intellectually stimulating country house filled with five spirited young women) that he lamented that he had to leave after a week to attend to the correspondence that had been piling up in London. In his thank-you note to the Shipleys, which included a present of dried apples from America, Franklin complained that he had to “breathe with reluctance the smoke of London” and said he hoped to get back to the “sweet air of Twyford” for a longer visit later that summer.<a href="part0030_split_011.html#ch_11_en_3" id="ch_11_een_3"><sup class="calibre7">3</sup></a></span></p>
<h3 class="chapterHeadA">The Autobiography</h3>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin, at 65, had begun to think about family matters more. He felt affection for all of his kin, despite the fact—or perhaps, as he himself speculated, because of the fact—that he continued to live far away from them. In a long letter to his sole surviving sibling, Jane Mecom, that summer, he praised her for getting along well with her Philadelphia in-laws and, in a telling passage, reflected on how much easier it was for relatives to remain friendly from afar. “Our father, who was a very wise man, used to say nothing was more common than for those who loved one another at a distance to find many causes of dislike when they came together.” A good example, he noted, was the relationship their father had with his brother Benjamin. “Though I was a child I still remember how affectionate their correspondence was” while Benjamin remained in England. But when Uncle Benjamin moved to Boston, they began to engage in “disputes and misunderstandings.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin also wrote Jane about Sally Franklin, a 16-year-old who had joined his surrogate family on Craven Street. Sally was the only child of a second cousin who had continued the Franklin family’s textile dyeing business in Leicestershire. Accompanying the letter was a detailed family tree showing how they were all descendants of Thomas Franklin of Ecton and noting that Sally was the last in England to bear the family name.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>His interest in family was further piqued when he happened to visit one of his favorite used-book shops in London. The dealer showed him a collection of old political pamphlets that were filled with annotations. Franklin was amazed to discover that they had belonged to his Uncle Benjamin. “I suppose he parted with them when he left England,” Franklin wrote in a letter to another cousin. He promptly bought them.<a href="part0030_split_011.html#ch_11_en_4" id="ch_11_een_4"><sup class="calibre7">4</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>So, in late July, when he was finally free to return to Twyford for a longer stay with the Shipleys, he was in a reflective mood. His career was at an impasse, and the history of his family was on his mind. Thus, the stage was set for the first installment of the most enduring of his literary efforts, <span class="italic"><span>The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>“Dear son,” he began, casting his account as a letter to William, whom he had not seen for seven years. The epistolary guise gave him the opportunity to be chatty and casual in his prose. He pretended, at least initially, that this was merely a personal communication rather than a work of literature. “I used to write more methodically,” he said in a paragraph he inserted into the text after rereading some of the rambling genealogical digressions he had composed on the first day. “But one does not dress for private company as for a public ball.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Was the autobiography really just for the private company of his son? No. It was clear from the outset that Franklin was writing for public consumption as well. The family information that would most interest his son was omitted completely: the identity and description of William’s own mother. Nor did Franklin write the letter on regular stationery; instead, he used the left half of large folio sheets, leaving the right half blank for revisions and additions.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>At the beginning of his second day of writing, he stopped to make an outline of his entire career, showing his intention to construct a full memoir. Also, that second morning, he used the blank right-hand columns of his first pages to insert a long section justifying the “vanity” of his decision to “indulge the inclination so natural in old men to be talking of themselves.” His goal, he declared, was to describe how he rose from obscurity to prominence and to provide some useful hints about how he succeeded, expressing hope that others might find them suitable to be imitated.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>This was obviously directed at an audience beyond that of his son, who was already 40 and the governor of New Jersey. There was, however, a subtext directed at him: William had taken on airs since becoming a governor, and he was far more enamored of the aristocracy and establishment than his father. The autobiography would be a reminder of their humble origins and a paean to hard work, thrift, shopkeeping values, and the role of an industrious middle class that resisted rather than emulated the pretensions of the well-born elite.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>For almost three weeks, Franklin wrote by day and then read aloud portions to the Shipleys in the evening. Because the work was cast as a letter, and because it was read aloud, Franklin’s prose took on the voice of a lovable old raconteur. Lacking in literary flair, with nary a metaphor nor poetic flourish, the narrative flowed as a string of wry anecdotes and instructive lessons. Occasionally, when he found himself writing with too much pride about an event, he would revise it by adding a self-deprecating comment or ironic aside, just as would a good after-dinner storyteller.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>The result was one of Franklin’s most delightful literary creations: the portrait he painted of his younger self. The novelist John Updike has memorably called it an “elastically insouciant work, full of cheerful contradictions and humorous twists—a fond look back upon an earlier self, giving an intensely ambitious young man the benefit of the older man’s relaxation.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>With a mix of wry detachment and amused self-awareness, Franklin was able to keep his creation at a bit of a distance, to be modestly revealing but never deeply so. Amid all the enlightening anecdotes, he included few intimations of inner torment, no struggles of the soul or reflections of the deeper spirit. More pregnant than profound, his recollections provide a cheerful look at a simple approach to life that only hints at the deeper meanings he found in serving his fellow man and thus his God. What he wrote had little pretension other than pretending to poke fun at all pretensions. It was the work of a gregarious man who loved to recount stories, turn them into down-home parables that could lead to a better life, and delve into the shallows of simple lessons.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>To some, this simplicity is its failing. The great literary critic Charles Angoff declares that “it is lacking in almost everything necessary to a really great work of <span class="italic"><span>belles lettres:</span></span> grace of expression, charm of personality, and intellectual flight.” But surely it is unfair to say that it lacks charm of personality, and as the historian Henry Steele Commager points out, its “artless simplicity, lucidity, homely idiom, freshness and humor have commended it anew to each generation of readers.” Indeed, read with an unjaundiced eye, it is a pure delight as well as an archetype of homespun American literature. And it was destined to become, through hundreds of editions published in almost every language, the world’s most popular autobiography.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>In this age of instant memoirs, it is important to note that Franklin was producing something relatively new for his time. St. Augustine’s <span class="italic"><span>Confessions</span></span> had mainly been about his religious conversion, and Rousseau’s <span class="italic"><span>Confessions</span></span> had not yet been published. “There had been almost no famous autobiographies before Franklin, and he had no models,” writes Carl Van Doren. That is not entirely true. Among those who had already published some form of autobiography were Benvenuto Cellini, Lord Herbert of Cherbury, and Bishop Gilbert Burnet. But Van Doren is correct when he says that Franklin “wrote for a middle class which had few historians. His book was the first masterpiece of autobiography by a self-made man.” The closest model that he had, in terms of narrative style, was one of his favorite books, John Bunyan’s allegorical dream, <span class="italic"><span>A Pilgrim’s Progress.</span></span> But Franklin’s was the story of a very real pilgrim, albeit a lapsed one, in a very real world.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>By the time he had to leave Twyford in mid-August, he had finished the first of four installments in what would later become known as the <span class="italic"><span>Autobiography.</span></span> It took him through his years as a young printer engaged in civic endeavors and ended with the founding of the Philadelphia library and its offshoots in 1731. Only in his last lines did he let a note of politics creep in. “These libraries,” he noted, “have made the common tradesmen and farmers as intelligent as most gentlemen from other countries, and perhaps have contributed in some degree to the stand so generally made throughout the colonies in defense of their privileges.” It would be thirteen years before, at the urging of friends, he would pick up that part of the tale.<a href="part0030_split_011.html#ch_11_en_5" id="ch_11_een_5"><sup class="calibre7">5</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Always eager to create a family wherever he could find one, Franklin took the Shipley’s youngest daughter, Kitty, 11, under his wing and brought her in his coach back to London, where she was going to school. Along the way, they chatted about the type of man each of the Shipley daughters would marry. Kitty felt all of her sisters deserved a very rich merchant or aristocrat. As for herself, Kitty coquettishly allowed, “I like an old man, indeed I do, and somehow or another all the old men take to me.” Perhaps she should marry a younger man, Franklin suggested, “and let him grow old upon your hands, because you’ll like him better and better every year as he grows older.” Kitty replied that she would prefer to marry someone already older, “and then you know I may be a rich young widow.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Another lifelong flirtation was born. He had his wife send over a squirrel from Philadelphia as a pet for all the Shipley girls. When the creature met an untimely end a year later in the jaws of a dog, Franklin composed a flowery epitaph and then added a simpler one that would become famous: “Here Skugg/Lies snug/As a bug/In a rug.” His affection for Kitty would be immortalized fifteen years later when Franklin, then 80, wrote for her a little essay on “The Art of Procuring Pleasant Dreams.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>On his last evening at Twyford, the Shipleys had insisted on throwing a birthday party, in absentia, for his Philadelphia grandson, 2-year-old Benjamin Franklin Bache. “That he may be as good as his grandfather,” Mrs. Shipley said in her toast. Franklin responded that he hoped that Benny would, in fact, turn out much better. To which Bishop Shipley added, “We will compound the matter and be contented if he should not prove <span class="italic"><span>quite</span></span> so good.”<a href="part0030_split_011.html#ch_11_en_6" id="ch_11_een_6"><sup class="calibre7">6</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>The odd thing about all this affection for Benny was that Franklin had never met him, nor showed much of an inclination to do so. He had not even met the boy’s father. But at that moment, Richard Bache was arriving in England on a mission to find his famous father-in-law. Bache appeared unannounced on Craven Street, where Mrs. Stevenson joyously greeted him. Franklin, however, had already departed, after little more than a week in London, for another extended vacation.</span></p>
<h3 class="chapterHeadA">Ireland and Scotland</h3>
<p class="para"><span>Traveling with Richard Jackson, Pennsylvania’s other agent in England, Franklin left in late August 1771 for three months in Ireland and Scotland, hoping to see if the relationship those countries were trying to forge within the British Empire might serve as a model for America. There were some promising signs. When they visited the Irish Parliament, Jackson was accorded the right to sit in the chamber because he was a member of England’s Parliament. On seeing the famous Franklin, the Speaker proposed that, because he represented American legislatures, he should be accorded such a privilege as well. “The whole House gave a loud, unanimous Aye,” Franklin reported to Cushing. “I esteemed it a mark of respect for our country.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>On the other hand, much of what he saw in Ireland distressed him. England severely regulated Irish trade, and absentee English landlords exploited Irish tenant farmers. “They live in wretched hovels of mud and straw, are clothed in rags, and subsist chiefly on potatoes,” he noted. His shock at the disparity between rich and poor made him all the more proud that America was building a vibrant middle class. The strength of America, he wrote, was its proud freeholders and tradesmen, who had the right to vote on public affairs and ample opportunity to feed and clothe their families.<a href="part0030_split_011.html#ch_11_en_7" id="ch_11_een_7"><sup class="calibre7">7</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>While in Dublin, Franklin happened to run into his nemesis, Lord Hillsborough, whose family estate was in northern Ireland. Surprisingly, Hillsborough insisted that he and Jackson stop by on their way to Scotland. Franklin was conflicted. “As it might afford an opportunity of saying something on American affairs,” he wrote one friend, “I concluded to comply with his invitation.” But he subsequently wrote his son that he had “determined not to go.” As it turned out, Jackson insisted on going, and Franklin could not find another coach so had to follow along.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>It was an astonishingly friendly visit. At Hillsborough’s house, Franklin was “detained by a thousand civilities” for almost a week. The minister “seemed attentive to everything that might make my stay in his house agreeable.” That even included “putting his own cloak about my shoulders when I went out, that I might not take cold.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>In discussing Ireland’s poverty, Hillsborough blamed it on England for restraining manufacturing there. Wasn’t the same true, Franklin asked, about England’s policy toward America? To Franklin’s pleasure, Hillsborough responded that “America ought not to be restrained in manufacturing.” He even suggested a subsidy for American silk industries and winemaking. He would be pleased to hear Franklin’s “opinion and advice” on that, as well as on how to form a government for Newfoundland. Would Franklin consider these issues and when he returned to London “favor him with my sentiments?”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>“Does not all this seem extraordinary to you?” he wrote his son. In a letter to Thomas Cushing, he suggested there might be a more cynical explanation. Hillsborough’s behavior might be “meant only, by patting and stroking the horse, to make him more patient when the reins are drawn tighter and the spurs set deeper into his sides.” Or, perhaps “he apprehended an approaching storm and was desirous of lessening beforehand the number of enemies he had so imprudently created.”<a href="part0030_split_011.html#ch_11_en_8" id="ch_11_een_8"><sup class="calibre7">8</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin arrived, through storms and floods, in Edinburgh late on a Saturday and spent one night “lodged miserably” at an inn. “But that excellent Christian, David Hume, agreeable to the precepts of the gospel, has received the stranger and I now live with him,” Franklin reported the next day. His old friend Hume had built a new house, and he took pride that the sheep’s head soup made by his cook was the best in Europe. The talk at the table was also enviable: philosophy (Hume had recently befriended Rousseau in Paris), history, and the plight of the American colonies.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>After ten days, Franklin traveled west toward Glasgow to see Lord Kames, his other favorite Scottish philosopher. Kames was also a great botanist who cultivated arbors of diverse trees; the ones Franklin planted on his visit are alive today. On his way back to Edinburgh, Franklin stopped at the Carron iron works, where James Watt was developing the steam engine, so that he could continue his study of industrialization. Among the ordnance they saw being cast, some of which would be used against the colonies in a few years, were cannons that weighed up to thirty-two tons.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Back at Hume’s house in Edinburgh, Franklin spent another few days enjoying the intellectual circle there. He met with Adam Smith, who reportedly showed him some early chapters of the <span class="italic"><span>Wealth of Nations</span></span> that he was then writing. Perhaps suspecting that they would never see their American friend again, Hume hosted a farewell dinner that included a variety of Franklin’s favorite Scottish academics and writers, including Lord Kames.<a href="part0030_split_011.html#ch_11_en_9" id="ch_11_een_9"><sup class="calibre7">9</sup></a></span></p>
<h3 class="chapterHeadA">Meeting Bache</h3>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin had planned to stay longer with Hume, but two letters caught up with him while he was there. One was from his son-in-law, Richard Bache. Having missed Franklin in London, he wrote, he had gone to visit his own parents in Preston, a city in the north of England near Manchester. The other was from Polly. “Mr. Bache is at Preston, where he will wait with the pleasing expectation of seeing you on your return. We were all very much pleased with him.” So Franklin hastened his departure for London and decided to visit his new in-law on the way.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Sally Franklin Bache, not surprisingly, was fretting back in Philadelphia about how her husband and father would get along. “If it should not be as cordial as I could wish,” she wrote Richard, “I know when you consider it is my father, your goodness to and affection for me will make you try a little to gain his esteem and friendship.” As it turned out, her fears were unfounded. “I can,” Bache joyously wrote Deborah, “with great satisfaction, tell you that he received me with open arms and with a degree of affection I did not expect.” He was particularly pleased that everyone told him he looked like Franklin, a revelation in those pre-Freudian times that was not seen as a reflection of Sally’s taste in a husband. “I should be glad to be like him in any respect,” Bache enthused.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Indeed, the old charmer wowed everyone in Bache’s family, particularly his mother, Mary Bache, a “stately” and “serious” widow of 68, who had borne twenty children. During the visit, she stayed up until midnight talking to Franklin. A few weeks later, Franklin sent her a thank-you note with some oysters and (his vanity not fully conquered) a portrait of himself. Mrs. Bache carried it back and forth from the parlor to the dining room so she could view it all the time. “It is so like the original you cannot imagine with what pleasure we look at it, as we can perceive in it the likeness of my son as well as yourself.”<a href="part0030_split_011.html#ch_11_en_10" id="ch_11_een_10"><sup class="calibre7">10</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Bache traveled back to London with Franklin, stayed with him for a while on Craven Street, and tried hard to please. “His behavior here has been agreeable to me,” Franklin told Deborah. But his affection did not extend to offering Bache the help he sought in winning a public appointment, such as customs inspector. “I am of the opinion that almost any profession a man has been educated in is preferable to an office held…subject to the caprices of superiors.” Instead, he advised Bache to go home, become a merchant “selling only for ready cash,” and to “always be close” to his wife. This advice, it must be remembered, came from a man who had lived across an ocean from his wife for much of fifteen years and had been clinging to his appointment as a royal postmaster.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>As for Sally, he advised that she should learn accounting (always a theme) and help her husband out. “In keeping a store, if it be where you dwell, you can be serviceable to him as your mother was to me; for you are not deficient in that capacity, and I hope are not too proud.” The Baches, ever mindful, would end up living in Deborah’s house, opening a store in one of Franklin’s Market Street buildings, and advertising “for cash only” a variety of silks and textiles for sale. When this dry goods shop turned out to be, as Bache complained to Franklin, a “sorry concern,” he converted it to a “wine and grocery business,” which also fared poorly. It was not the status or situation a woman of Sally’s education and Bache’s ambition felt was their due, but they followed Franklin’s injunction to be not too proud.<a href="part0030_split_011.html#ch_11_en_11" id="ch_11_een_11"><sup class="calibre7">11</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Deborah wrote Franklin so often about their grandson Benny that one can detect a note of caution creeping into his responses: “I can see you are quite in love with him, and your happiness wrapped up in his.” He praised her for not stepping in during an argument when Sally was trying to discipline Benny: “I feared, from your fondness of him, that he would be too much humored, and perhaps spoiled.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>He felt differently, however, about spoiling Polly Stevenson’s new son, William Hewson, who had been born that spring. “Pray let him have everything he likes,” he had written to Polly. “It gives [children] a pleasant air and…the face is ever after the handsomer for it.” In the same letter, he responded sanguinely to Polly’s teasing news that her mother had a new male friend. “I have been used to rivals,” replied Franklin, “and scarce ever had a friend or a mistress in my whole life that other people did not like as well as myself.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Within two years, Billy Hewson had become Franklin’s surrogate grandson. Responding to yet another letter from his wife describing their own grandson, Franklin wrote: “In return for your history of your <span class="italic"><span>grandson,</span></span> I must give you a little of the history of my <span class="italic"><span>godson.</span></span> He is now 21 months old, very strong and healthy, begins to speak a little, and even to sing. He was with us a few days last week, grew fond of me, and would not be contented to sit down to breakfast without coming to call Pa.” He did deign to add, however, that watching Billy “makes me long to be at home to play with Ben.”<a href="part0030_split_011.html#ch_11_en_12" id="ch_11_een_12"><sup class="calibre7">12</sup></a></span></p>
<h3 class="chapterHeadA">More Science and Invention</h3>
<p class="para"><span>When he poured the teaspoon of oil on the pond in Clapham and noted that it spread for a half acre, Franklin had come close to a discovery that would not be made for another century: determining the size of a molecule. If he had taken the volume of the teaspoon of oil (2 cubic centimeters) and divided it by the half-acre area it covered (2,000 square meters), he would have arrived at a ballpark figure (10<sup class="calibre7">-7</sup>centimeters) for the thickness of an oil molecule. As Charles Tanford noted in his wonderful book, <span class="italic"><span>Ben Franklin Stilled the Waves,</span></span> “Franklin had actually correctly determined the scale of magnitude of molecular dimensions, the first person ever to do so, but he did not recognize it.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin was always better at practical applications than theoretical analysis. Rather than speculate about the size of molecules, he looked for uses for his oil-and-water experiments. Might it be possible to save ships from dangerous waves by dumping oil into the ocean? With three friends from the Royal Academy, he went to Portsmouth to see. “The experiment,” Franklin reported, “had not the success we wished.” The surface ripples were smoothed, but not the force of the underlying surges (another metaphor, perhaps). His report on his failed experiment was deemed useful enough, however, to be published in the <span class="italic"><span>Philosophical Transactions</span></span> of the Royal Society.<a href="part0030_split_011.html#ch_11_en_13" id="ch_11_een_13"><sup class="calibre7">13</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Throughout his time in England, whenever he could escape the demands of politics, he continued his scientific inquiries. After he wired some lightning rods on St. Paul’s Cathedral, the keepers of the royal munitions asked him to propose ways to protect their buildings from lightning as well. This again embroiled Franklin in a dispute over whether lightning rods should have pointed or rounded tops; Franklin insisted on pointed ones, but (perhaps for political reasons) King George changed them to rounded ones after the American Revolution. Franklin also devised a system of hot-water pipes to keep the House of Commons warm.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Other excursions into science and invention during his years in London included:</span></p>
<ul class="calibre9">
<li class="calibre8"><span class="italic"><span>The Cause of Colds:</span></span> Although germs and viruses had yet to be discovered, Franklin was one of the first to argue that colds and flu “may possibly be spread by contagion” rather than cold air. “Traveling in our severe winters, I have often suffered cold sometimes to the extremity only short of freezing, but this did not make me catch cold,” he wrote the Philadelphia physician Benjamin Rush in 1773. “People often catch cold from one another when shut up together in close rooms, coaches, etc., and when sitting near and conversing so as to breathe in each other’s transpiration.” The best defense was fresh air. Throughout his life, Franklin liked good ventilation and open windows, even in the midst of winter.<a href="part0030_split_011.html#ch_11_en_14" id="ch_11_een_14"><sup class="calibre7">14</sup></a></li>
<li class="calibre8"><span class="italic"><span>The Study of Exercise:</span></span> One way to prevent colds, he argued, was regular exercise. The best way to measure exercise, he argued, was not by its duration but “by the degree of warmth it produces in the body.” This was one of the first theories linking exercise to calories of heat. For example, he explained, walking a mile up and down stairs produced five times more body warmth than walking a mile on a level surface. When swinging weights, Franklin calculated that this raised his pulse from 60 to 100 beats per minute. Again, he rightly calculated that body “warmth generally increases with quickness of pulse.”<a href="part0030_split_011.html#ch_11_en_15" id="ch_11_een_15"><sup class="calibre7">15</sup></a></li>
<li class="calibre8"><span class="italic"><span>Lead Poisoning:</span></span> As a printer, Franklin had noticed that the handling of hot lead type often caused a stiffness or paralysis. He also noticed that people in certain trades were prone to a severe illness called “dry belly ache.” A friend added a clue by noting that people who drank rum from stills that used metal coils also got the disease. Acting as an epidemiologist, Franklin became one of the first to discover the cause of this malady. “It affects among tradesmen those that use lead, however different their trades, as glazers, type-founders, plumbers, potters, white-lead makers and painters.” He suggested, among other things, that the coils of stills should be made of pure tin, instead of pewter that includes lead.<a href="part0030_split_011.html#ch_11_en_16" id="ch_11_een_16"><sup class="calibre7">16</sup></a></li>
<li class="calibre8"><span class="italic"><span>Ships in Canals:</span></span> When visiting Holland, Franklin and his friend Sir John Pringle, president of the Royal Society, were told that ships passing through shallow canals went more slowly than those in deeper canals. This was because, Franklin surmised, each time a boat moved one length of distance, it would have to displace an amount of water equal to the space that her hull took up under the water. That water would then have to pass alongside or underneath the boat. If the passage underneath was constrained by being shallow, more water would have to rush past the sides of the boat, thus slowing her down. Here was a scientific theory that had enormous practical importance. So Franklin reacted accordingly. “I determined to make an experiment of this,” he wrote Pringle. He built a fourteen-foot wooden trough that was six inches wide and deep, and in it he put a little boat that was tugged by a silk thread. The thread was placed over a pulley and pulled by the weight of a small coin. He repeatedly timed how fast the toy boat moved when the water was at various depths. The results showed that it took 20 percent more power or time to move a boat through a shallow canal than a deeper one.<a href="part0030_split_011.html#ch_11_en_17" id="ch_11_een_17"><sup class="calibre7">17</sup></a></li>
<li class="calibre8"><span class="italic"><span>The Saltiness of Oceans:</span></span> At the time, the prevailing opinion about why the oceans were salty was that they had originally been filled with fresh water, but over the eons they accumulated the salts and minerals that were dumped into them by rivers. Franklin surmised, in a letter to his brother Peter, that there was just as much evidence for the other hypothesis: “All the water on this globe was originally salt, and the fresh water we find in springs and rivers is the produce of distillation.” As it turns out, Franklin was incorrect in this case. The oceans, over the centuries, have been getting saltier.<a href="part0030_split_011.html#ch_11_en_18" id="ch_11_een_18"><sup class="calibre7">18</sup></a></li>
<li class="calibre8"><span class="italic"><span>The Armonica:</span></span> Among the most amusing of his inventions was a musical instrument he called the armonica. It was based on the common practice of bored dinner guests, and some musicians, of producing a resonant tone by moving a wet finger around the rim of a glass. Franklin attended a concert in England of music performed on wineglasses, and in 1761 he perfected the idea by taking thirty-seven glass bowls of different sizes and attaching them to a spindle. He rigged up a foot pedal and flywheel to spin the contraption, which allowed him to produce various tones by pressing on the glass pieces with his wet fingers. In a letter to an Italian electrician, Franklin described the new instrument in minute detail. “It is an instrument,” he said, “that seems peculiarly adapted to Italian music, especially that of the soft and plaintive kind.” Franklin’s armonica was quite a rage for a while. Marie Antoinette took lessons on it, Mozart and Beethoven wrote pieces for it, and its haunting tones became popular at weddings. But it tended to produce melancholia, perhaps from lead poisoning, and it eventually went out of fashion.<a href="part0030_split_011.html#ch_11_en_19" id="ch_11_een_19"><sup class="calibre7">19</sup></a></li>

<h3 class="chapterHeadA">Social Philosophy</h3>
<p class="para"><span>Over the years, Franklin had been developing a social outlook that, in its mixture of liberal, populist, and conservative ideas, would become one archetype of American middle-class philosophy. He exalted hard work, individual enterprise, frugality, and self-reliance. On the other hand, he also pushed for civic cooperation, social compassion, and voluntary community improvement schemes. He was equally distrustful of the elite and the rabble, of ceding power to a well-born establishment or to an unruly mob. With his shopkeeper’s values, he cringed at class warfare. Bred into his bones was a belief in social mobility and the bootstrap values of rising through hard work.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>His innate conservatism about government intervention and welfare was evident in the series of questions he had posed to Peter Collinson in 1753 (see pp. 148–49). Back then, he had asked whether laws “which compel the rich to maintain the poor have not given the latter a dependence” and “provide encouragements for laziness.”<a href="part0030_split_011.html#ch_11_en_20" id="ch_11_een_20"><sup class="calibre7">20</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>To Collinson these points were raised as questions. But in his essays in the late 1760s and early 1770s, Franklin asserted his conservatism more forcefully. Most notable was an anonymous piece entitled “On the Laboring Poor,” which he signed “Medius,” from the Latin word for “middle,” and published in <span class="italic"><span>The Gentleman’s Magazine</span></span> in1768. In the essay, he chastised writers who stirred up the rabble by claiming that the poor were oppressed by the rich. “Will you admit a word or two on the other side of the question?” he asked. The condition of the poor in England was the best in Europe, he argued. Why? Because in England there was legislation to help support the poor. “This law was not made by the poor. The legislators were men of fortune…They voluntarily subjected their own estates, and the estates of others, to a payment of a tax for the maintenance of the poor.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>These laws were compassionate. But he warned that they could have unintended consequences and promote laziness: “I fear the giving mankind a dependence on anything for support in age or sickness, besides industry and frugality during youth and health, tends to flatter our natural indolence, to encourage idleness and prodigality, and thereby to promote and increase poverty, the very evil it was intended to cure.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Not only did he warn against welfare dependency, but he offered his own version of the trickle-down theory of economics. The more money made by the rich and by all of society, the more money that would make its way down to the poor. “The rich do not work for one another…Everything that they or their families use and consume is the produce of the laboring poor.” The rich spend their money in ways that enrich the laboring poor: clothing and furniture and dwellings. “Our laboring poor receive annually the whole of the clear revenues of the nation.” He also debunked the idea of imposing a higher minimum wage: “A law might be made to raise their wages; but if our manufactures are too dear, they might not vend abroad.”<a href="part0030_split_011.html#ch_11_en_21" id="ch_11_een_21"><sup class="calibre7">21</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>His economic conservatism was balanced, however, by his fundamental moral belief that actions should be judged by how much they benefit the common good. Policies that encouraged hard work were good, but not because they led to great accumulations of private wealth; they were good because they increased the total well-being of a community and the dignity of every aspiring individual. People who acquired more wealth than they needed had a duty to help others and to create civic institutions that promoted the success of others. “His ideal was of a prosperous middle class whose members lived simple lives of democratic equality,” writes James Campbell. “Those who met with greater economic success in life were responsible to help those in genuine need; but those who from lack of virtue failed to pull their own weight could expect no help from society.”<a href="part0030_split_011.html#ch_11_en_22" id="ch_11_een_22"><sup class="calibre7">22</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>To this philosophical mix Franklin added an increasingly fervent advocacy of the traditional English liberal values of individual rights and liberties. He had not yet, however, completed his evolution on the great moral question of slavery. As an agent for some of the colonies, including Georgia, he found himself awkwardly and unconvincingly defending America against British attacks that slavery made a mockery of the colonists’ demands for liberty.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>In 1770, he published anonymously a “Conversation on Slavery” in which the American participant tries to defend himself against charges of hypocrisy. Only “one family in a hundred” in America has slaves, and of those, “many treat their slaves with great humanity.” He also argued that the condition of the “working poor” in England “seems something a little like slavery.” At one point, the speaker’s argument even lapses into racism: “Perhaps you imagine the Negroes to be a mild tempered, tractable kind of people. Some of them are indeed so. But the majority are of a plotting disposition, dark, sullen, malicious, revengeful and cruel in the highest degree.”<a href="part0030_split_011.html#ch_11_en_23" id="ch_11_een_23"><sup class="calibre7">23</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>In his desire to defend America at all costs, Franklin had produced what was one of the worst arguments he ever wrote. Even his facts were wrong. The proportion of slave-owning families in America was not one in a hundred, but close to one in nine (47,664 families out of a total 410,636 American families owned slaves in 1790). Making his argument morally as well as factually weak was the fact that, even as he tried to argue that slave owning was an aberration, Franklin’s own family was among those who still kept slaves. Although the two slaves who had accompanied him on his first trip to England were no longer with him, one or two continued to be part of Deborah’s Philadelphia household.<a href="part0030_split_011.html#ch_11_en_24" id="ch_11_een_24"><sup class="calibre7">24</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>His views, however, were still evolving. Two years after he wrote the “Conversation,” Franklin began corresponding with the ardent Philadelphia abolitionist Anthony Benezet. He used some of Benezet’s arguments in a 1772 piece he wrote for the London <span class="italic"><span>Chronicle</span></span> in which he decried, using stronger language than ever, the “constant butchery of the human species by this pestilent detestable traffic in the bodies and souls of men.” He even edged closer to Benezet’s argument that slavery itself—not merely the importation of new slaves—had to be abolished. “I am glad to hear that the disposition against keeping Negroes grows more general in North America,” he wrote Benezet. “I hope in time it will be taken into consideration and suppressed by the legislature.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin wrote in a similar vein to his friend the Philadelphia physician Benjamin Rush. “I hope in time that the friends to liberty and humanity will get the better of a practice that has so long disgraced our nation and religion.” Yet it is important to note that, both to Benezet and to Rush, Franklin included the same qualifying phrase: “in time.” For Franklin, support for complete abolition of slave ownership (rather than merely ending the importation of slaves) would come only in time, only after the Revolution.<a href="part0030_split_011.html#ch_11_en_25" id="ch_11_een_25"><sup class="calibre7">25</sup></a></span></p>
<h3 class="chapterHeadA">Defeating Hillsborough</h3>
<p class="para"><span>Lord Hillsborough’s solicitous warmth in Ireland, which had so baffled Franklin, soon dissipated. “When I had been a little while returned to London,” Franklin wrote his son, “I waited on him to thank him for his civilities in Ireland.” The porter informed Franklin that the minister was “not at home.” Franklin left his card and returned another day to hear the same response, even though Franklin knew Hillsborough was indeed receiving guests that day. He tried the next week, then the next, to no avail. “The last time was on a levee day, when a number of carriages were at his door. My coachman, driving up, alighted and was opening the coach door when the porter, seeing me, came out and surlily chid the coachman for opening the door before he had enquired whether my lord was at home; and then, turning to me, said: ‘My lord is not at home.’ I have never since been nigh him, and we have only abused one another at a distance.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Hillsborough “threw me away as an orange that would yield no juice and therefore not worth more squeezing,” Franklin complained. Again he considered returning to Philadelphia. “I grow homesick,” he wrote William. But there was still one factor that kept him from leaving England in fury. Against all odds, he remained hopeful that he could secure for himself (and friends, family, and partners) a western land grant along the Ohio.<a href="part0030_split_011.html#ch_11_en_26" id="ch_11_een_26"><sup class="calibre7">26</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>To that end, he had been involved with a variety of partnerships, including ones called the Illinois Company and then the Indiana Company, that had failed to win support in London. In the summer of 1769, Franklin helped organize a consortium so powerful that he was convinced it would be able to outmaneuver Lord Hillsborough. The Grand Ohio Company, as it was named, included a collection of some of London’s richest and most prominent names, most notably Thomas and Richard Walpole. For a while, it seemed the group, known as the Walpole Company, was destined for success. But in the summer of 1770, Hillsborough managed to have the scheme tabled for more study.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>The Walpole group, however, was able to keep its prospects alive by spreading around ownership shares to an array of top ministers, including the lord chancellor and the president of the Privy Council. By the spring of 1772, Hillsborough could delay the matter no longer. Even the king let Hillsborough know that he expected the matter to be considered. In April, the board of trade sent the land application to the Privy Council with a recommendation that it be denied. But the Privy Council, two months later, held its own hearing, attended by Franklin, Walpole, and many of their influential shareholders. Hillsborough threatened to resign if it was approved, a prospect that likely hurt his case because many on the council were eager, in Franklin’s words, “to mortify him.” And they did. The grant was approved, and Hillsborough resigned.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin and friends would never end up getting their land grant; the growing tensions between Britain and the colonies intervened. “The affair of the grant goes on but slowly,” he wrote a friend the following year. “I begin to be a little of the sailor’s mind when they were handing a cable out of a store into a ship, and one of them said: ‘ ’Tis a long, heavy cable. I wish we could see the end of it.’ ‘Damn me,’ says another, ‘if I believe it has any end; somebody has cut it off.’ ”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Still, Franklin had succeeded in ousting his nemesis. “At length we have gotten rid of Lord Hillsborough,” he exulted to William. Hillsborough, in turn, called Franklin “one of the most mischievous men in England.” Yet, in that odd way they had of cloaking their enmity in occasional bouts of feigned cordiality, the two men made peace when they happened upon each other at Oxford the following summer. Hillsborough made a point of bowing and complimenting Franklin. “In return for this extravagance,” Franklin reported to William, “I complimented him on his son’s performance in the theatre, though indeed it was but indifferent; so that account was settled. For as people say when they are angry: ‘If he strikes me, I’ll strike him again’; I sometimes think it might be right to say: ‘If he flatters me, I’ll flatter him again.’”<a href="part0030_split_011.html#ch_11_en_27" id="ch_11_een_27"><sup class="calibre7">27</sup></a></span></p>
<h3 class="chapterHeadA">The Hutchinson Letters</h3>
<p class="para"><span>“There has lately fallen into my hands part of a correspondence that I have reason to believe laid the foundation of most if not all our present grievances.” With these fateful words, written to his Massachusetts supporter Thomas Cushing in December 1772, Franklin stirred up a tempest that would lead to his final break with Britain. Enclosed was a batch of letters, six of them written by Massachusetts governor Thomas Hutchinson, a Boston merchant from an old Puritan family, who had once been Franklin’s friend when they had put together the Albany Plan for colonial union in 1754. The letters had been given to Franklin surreptitiously by an unnamed member of Parliament, and he forwarded them to Cushing with the injunction that they not be made public.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Hutchinson’s letters were filled with advice on how to subdue colonial unrest. “There must be an abridgment of what are called English liberties,” he had written. When they were published in Boston (John and Samuel Adams, with the acquiescence of Thomas Cushing, made sure that they were, despite Franklin’s request that they not be), they stoked the growing fury of the radical patriots there.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>This was the opposite of what Franklin had intended. His aim was to calm the rebellious sentiments by privately showing Cushing and a few other leaders that England’s misguided policies had been caused by bad advice from people such as Hutchinson more than by unreasonable hatred for America. The letters, he believed, might even promote a “tendency…towards a reconciliation,” which is what, he later claimed, “I earnestly wished.”<a href="part0030_split_011.html#ch_11_en_28" id="ch_11_een_28"><sup class="calibre7">28</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Indeed, most of Franklin’s missives in early 1773 were designed to decrease tensions. “I hope that great care will be taken to keep our people quiet,” he wrote Cushing in March, “since nothing is more wished for by our enemies than that by insurrections we would give a good pretence for increasing the military among us and putting us under more severe restraints.” When the Massachusetts Assembly passed a resolution declaring that it was not subservient to Parliament, Franklin similarly urged the English to refrain from overreacting. “In my opinion, it would be better and more prudent to take no notice of it,” he wrote Colonial Secretary Lord Dartmouth, who had replaced Hillsborough. “It is words only.”<a href="part0030_split_011.html#ch_11_en_29" id="ch_11_een_29"><sup class="calibre7">29</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>To make his point without stirring up more animosity, Franklin reverted to his youthful love of satire in two anonymous propaganda pieces he wrote for the English papers in September 1773. The first was entitled “Rules by Which a Great Empire May be Reduced to a Small One.” Noting that “an ancient sage” (it was the Greek admiral and ruler Themistocles) had once boasted that he knew how to turn a little city into a great one, the essay listed twenty ways to do the reverse to an empire. Among them:</span></p>
<p class="calibre10"><span> </span></p>
<p class="calibre10"><span>In the first place, gentlemen, you are to consider that a great empire, like a great cake, is most easily diminished at the edges.</span></p>
<p class="calibre10"><span>Take special care the provinces are never incorporated with the Mother Country, that they do not enjoy the same common rights, the same privileges in commerce, and that they are governed by severer laws, all of your enacting, without allowing them any share in the choice of legislators.</span></p>
<p class="calibre10"><span>However peaceably your colonies have submitted to your government, shown their affection to your interest, and patiently borne their grievances, you are to suppose them always inclined to revolt, and treat them accordingly. Quarter troops among them, who by their insolence may provoke the rising of mobs…Like the husband who uses his wife ill from suspicion, you may in time convert your suspicions into realities.</span></p>
<p class="calibre10"><span>Whenever the injured come to the capital with complaints…punish such suitors with long delay, enormous expense, and a final judgment in favor of the oppressor.</span></p>
<p class="calibre10"><span>Resolve to harass them with novel taxes. They will probably complain to your Parliaments that they are taxed by a body in which they have no representative, and that this is contrary to common right…Let the Parliaments flout their claims…and treat the petitioners with utmost contempt.</span></p>
<p class="spaceBreak"><span> </span></p>
<p class="para"><span>The list, reflecting the indignities that had been perpetrated on America, went on at length: send them “prodigals” and “petty-fogging lawyers” to govern them, “perplex their commerce with infinite regulations,” appoint “insolent” tax collectors, and garrison your troops in their homes rather than on the frontier where they can be of use. If you follow these rules for diminishing your colonies, the essay concluded, you will “get rid of the trouble of governing them.” It was signed “Q.E.D.,” the initials for the Latin phrase <span class="italic"><span>quod erat demon-strandum</span></span> (which was to be demonstrated), used at the end of a philosophical argument to note the proposition was proved.<a href="part0030_split_011.html#ch_11_en_30" id="ch_11_een_30"><sup class="calibre7">30</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Two weeks later, Franklin published an even broader parody of Britain’s treatment of America, “An Edict by the King of Prussia.” A thinly disguised hoax, it purported to be a declaration issued by King Frederick II. Whereas the Germans had long ago created the first settlements in England and had lately protected it in the war against France, they had decided “that a revenue should be raised from said colonies in Britain.” So Prussia was levying 4.5 percent duties on all English imports and exports, and it was prohibiting the creation of any further manufacturing plants in England. The edict added that the felons in German jails “shall be emptied out” and sent to England “for the better peopling of that country.” Lest anyone be so thick as to miss the point, it concluded by noting that all of these measures should be considered “just and reasonable” in England because they were “copied” from the rules imposed by the British Parliament on the American colonies.<a href="part0030_split_011.html#ch_11_en_31" id="ch_11_een_31"><sup class="calibre7">31</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>When his “Edict” appeared, Franklin had the pleasure of being a guest at the country estate of Lord Le Despencer, who, as postmaster general of Britain, was Franklin’s boss and had become his friend. Le Despencer was, in Van Doren’s words, a “seasoned old sinner” who had restored a former abbey where he gathered dissolute friends for, as rumor had it, blasphemous rites and an occasional orgy. Franklin befriended him in 1772, when Le Despencer had become a bit more respectable, and helped him compile a simplified and deistic version of the Book of Common Prayer. (In his reformist zeal, Franklin had recently written a “more concise” version of the Lord’s Prayer as well.)</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin was chatting in the breakfast parlor with Le Despencer and others when a guest “came running in to us out of breath” with the morning papers and exclaimed, “Here’s the King of Prussia claiming a right to this kingdom!” Franklin feigned innocence as the story was read aloud.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>“Damn his impudence,” one of those present proclaimed.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>But as the reading neared its end, another guest began to sense the hoax. “I’ll be hanged if this is not some of your American jokes upon us,” he said to Franklin. The reading, Franklin noted, “ended with abundance of laughing and a general verdict that it was a fair hit.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin proudly described the parodies in a letter to William. He preferred the one on “Rules,” he said, because of the “quantity and variety of the matter contained and a kind of spirited ending of each paragraph,” but others preferred the “Edict.” He boasted, “I am not suspected as the author, except by one or two friends, and have heard the latter [‘Edict’] spoken of in the highest terms as the keenest and severest piece that has appeared here for a long time.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>His letter to William, however, was not wholly jovial. Slowly, inevitably, a rift was widening between the increasingly radical American agent and the royal governor with upper-class friends and aspirations. “Parliament has no right to make any law whatever binding on the colonies,” Franklin argued in the letter. “I know your sentiments differ from mine on these subjects. You are a thorough government man.”<a href="part0030_split_011.html#ch_11_en_32" id="ch_11_een_32"><sup class="calibre7">32</sup></a></span></p>
<h3 class="chapterHeadA">In the Cockpit</h3>
<p class="para"><span>“I want much to hear how that tea is received,” Franklin worriedly wrote a friend in late 1773. Parliament had added to the indignity of its continued tariff on tea by passing new regulations that gave the corrupt East India Company a virtual monopoly over the trade. Franklin urged calm, but the radicals of Boston, led by Sam Adams and the Sons of Liberty, did not. On December 16, 1773, after a mass rally in the Old South Church, some fifty patriots disguised as Mohawk Indians went down to the wharves and dumped 342 chests of tea worth £10,000 into the sea.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin was shocked by “the act of violent injustice on our part.” His sympathies for the colonial cause were not enough to overcome his basic conservatism about rabble rule. The shareholders of the East India Company “are not our adversaries,” he declared. It was wrong “to destroy private property.”<a href="part0030_split_011.html#ch_11_en_33" id="ch_11_een_33"><sup class="calibre7">33</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>As Boston was having its tea party, England was being roiled by recriminations from the release of the purloined Hutchinson letters. Franklin had expressed surprise that “my name has not been heard” in connection with the affair and added his “wish it may continue unknown.” But in December, two men engaged in an inconclusive duel in Hyde Park after one accused the other of leaking the letters. When a rematch seemed imminent, Franklin felt he had to step forward. “I alone am the person who obtained and transmitted to Boston the letters in question,” he wrote in a letter to the London <span class="italic"><span>Chronicle</span></span> on Christmas Day. But he did not apologize. These were not “private letters between friends,” he claimed, but were “written by public officers to persons in public station.” They were designed to “incense the Mother Country against her colonies.”<a href="part0030_split_011.html#ch_11_en_34" id="ch_11_een_34"><sup class="calibre7">34</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin’s role in publicizing purloined copies gave ammunition to those in Britain who saw him as a troublemaker. In early January, he was summoned to appear before the Privy Council in a famed room known as the Cockpit, because cockfights had been held there during the time of Henry VIII. The ostensible reason was to hear testimony on a petition from the Massachusetts Assembly to remove Hutchinson from the governorship. The questioning, however, quickly focused on whether the letters from Hutchinson, which had been presented as evidence by Franklin, were private and how they were obtained.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin was surprised to find at the hearing the solicitor general, Alexander Wedderburn, a nasty and ambitious prosecutor who had voted against the repeal of the Stamp Act and possessed (in the words of his prime minister Lord North) “an accommodating conscience.” It was clear that the political issue of the petition against Hutchinson was being turned into a legal case against Franklin for making his letters public. The government, Wedderburn said pointedly, had “the right of inquiring how they were obtained.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>“I thought this had been a matter of politics and not of law,” Franklin told the committee, “and I have not brought any counsel.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>“Dr. Franklin may have the assistance of counsel, or go on without it, as he shall choose,” said one of the lords on the council.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>“I desire to have counsel,” Franklin replied. Asked how long he needed to prepare his case, Franklin answered, “Three weeks.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>It was not a fun three weeks for Franklin. News of the Boston Tea Party reached England, further undermining sympathy for the American cause. He was called “an incendiary” and, he noted, “the papers were filled with invectives against me.” There were even hints that he might be jailed. His fellow shareholders in the Walpole group expressed fear that his involvement would hurt their case for a land grant, so he wrote them that “I do therefore desire that you will strike my name out of the list of your Associates.” (The letter, it should be noted, was cleverly phrased so that he did not, in fact, actually resign; he remained a secret shareholder without voting rights.)<a href="part0030_split_011.html#ch_11_en_35" id="ch_11_een_35"><sup class="calibre7">35</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>When the Privy Council reconvened in the Cockpit on January 29, 1774, the showdown made the original use of that room seem tame. “All the courtiers were invited,” Franklin noted, “as to an entertainment.” The packed crowd of councilors and spectators ranged from the Archbishop of Canterbury to the revenge-hungry Lord Hillsborough, with but a few friends of Franklin—including Edmund Burke, Lord Le Despencer, and Joseph Priestley—there to lend him moral support. Franklin later said it was like a “bull baiting.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Wedderburn, that man of sharp tongue, was both clever and brutal in his hour-long tirade. He called Franklin the “prime conductor”—an allusion to his electric fame—of the agitation against the British government. Instead of focusing on the merits of the Massachusetts petition, he homed in on the purloined letters. “Private correspondence has hitherto been held sacred,” he raged. “He has forfeited all the respect of societies and of men.” With a zinging wit, he added, “He will henceforth call it a libel to be called a man of letters.” In addition to wit there was ample invective. Burke called Wedderburn’s attack a “furious Phillipic,” and another spectator called it “a torrent of virulent abuse.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Amid his fury, Wedderburn scored some valid points. Ridiculing Franklin’s argument that Hutchinson’s desire to keep the letters secret was an admission he had something to hide, the solicitor correctly noted that Franklin had kept his own involvement in the affair secret for almost a year. “He kept himself concealed until he nearly occasioned the murder” of an innocent man, he said, referring to the duel in Hyde Park. Pounding the council table until (according to Jeremy Bentham) it “groaned under the assault,” Wedderburn accused Franklin of wanting to be governor himself.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>The crowd cheered and jeered, but Franklin betrayed not the slightest emotion as he stood at the edge of the room wearing a plain suit made of blue Manchester velvet. Edward Bancroft, a friend of Franklin’s (who later spied on him in Paris), described his behavior: “The Doctor was dressed in a full suit of spotted Manchester velvet, and stood conspicuously erect, without the smallest movement of any part of his body. The muscles of his face had been previously composed as to afford a placid tranquil expression of countenance, and he did not suffer the slightest alteration of it to appear.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>At the finale of his speech, Wedderburn called Franklin forward as a witness and declared, “I am ready to examine him.” The official records of the proceedings notes, “Dr. Franklin being present remained silent, but declared by his counsel that he did not choose to be examined.” Silence had often been his best weapon, making him seem wise or benign or serene. On this occasion, it made him look stronger than his powerful adversaries, contemptuous rather than contrite, condescending rather than cowed.<a href="part0030_split_011.html#ch_11_en_36" id="ch_11_een_36"><sup class="calibre7">36</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>The Privy Council, as expected, rejected the Massachusetts petition against Hutchinson, calling it “groundless, vexatious and scandalous.” The next day, Franklin was informed by letter that his old friend Lord Le Despencer “found it necessary” to remove him from his job as American postmaster. This infuriated him, for he was proud of having made the colonial system efficient and profitable, and he wrote a terse note to William suggesting that he leave his governorship and become a farmer. “It is an honester and more honorable, because a more independent, employment.” To his sister Jane, he was more ruminative: “I am deprived of my office. Don’t let this give you any uneasiness. You and I have almost finished the journey of life; we are now but a little way from home, and have enough in our pocket to pay the post chaises.”<a href="part0030_split_011.html#ch_11_en_37" id="ch_11_een_37"><sup class="calibre7">37</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Fearing that he might be arrested or his papers confiscated, Franklin slipped down to the Thames near Craven Street a few days after the Cockpit hearing. Carrying a trunk of his papers, he took a boat upriver to a friend’s house in Chelsea, where he laid low for a few days. When the danger passed, he returned to Craven Street and resumed receiving guests. “I do not find that I have lost a single friend on the occasion,” he noted. “All have visited me repeatedly with affectionate assurances of unaltered respect.” At their request, he wrote a very long and detailed account of the Hutchinson affair, but then did not publish it, noting that “such censures I have generally passed over in silence.”<a href="part0030_split_011.html#ch_11_en_38" id="ch_11_een_38"><sup class="calibre7">38</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>He did, however, continue his torrent of anonymous publications. Indulging an atypical but, given the circumstances, understandable desire to be boastful, he wrote a semianonymous piece (signed <span class="italic"><span>Homo Trium Literarum,</span></span> a “Man of Letters,” the insulting pun Wedderburn had hurled at him) that declared that “the admirers of Dr. Franklin in England are much shocked at Mr. Wedderburn’s calling him a thief.” He noted that the French, in the preface to his scientific papers just published there, also called him a thief: “To steal from the Heaven its sacred fire he taught.” In an unsigned description of the Cockpit hearings, published in a Boston paper, he claimed of himself that “the Doctor came by these letters honorably, his intention in sending them was virtuous: to lessen the breach between Britain and the colonies.”<a href="part0030_split_011.html#ch_11_en_39" id="ch_11_een_39"><sup class="calibre7">39</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>His satires and sarcasm became ever more biting. In one essay, written after General Gage had been sent to replace Hutchinson as governor in Massachusetts, he suggested that Britain “without delay introduce into North America a government absolutely and entirely military.” That would “so intimidate the Americans” that they would happily submit to all taxes. “When the colonists are drained of their last shilling,” he added, “they should be sold to the best bidder,” such as Spain or France. In another piece, he proposed a policy for General Gage to assure that more rebels did not arise in America: “all the males there be castrated.” For good measure, the “ringleaders” such as John Hancock and Sam Adams “should be shaved quite close.” Among the side benefits, he added, were that it would be useful to the opera and it would reduce the number of people emigrating from Britain to America.<a href="part0030_split_011.html#ch_11_en_40" id="ch_11_een_40"><sup class="calibre7">40</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Once again, the question arose: Why not finally head home? His wife was near death, he was a political outcast. Once again, he resolved to do so. As soon as he settled the post office accounts, he told friends; by May, he promised Richard Bache. And once again, he ended up not returning. For the rest of 1774, Franklin stayed in England with little to do, no official business to conduct, no ministers to lobby. Even the king found it curious.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>“Where is Dr. Franklin?” His Majesty asked Lord Dartmouth that summer.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>“I believe, sir, he is in town. He was going to America, but I fancy he is not gone.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>“I heard,” said the king, “he was going to Switzerland.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>“I think,” Lord Dartmouth replied, “there has been such a report.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>In fact, he had stayed close to Craven Street, venturing out rarely, seeing mainly close friends. As he would write to his sister in September, “I have seen no minister since January, nor had the least communication with them.”<a href="part0030_split_011.html#ch_11_en_41" id="ch_11_een_41"><sup class="calibre7">41</sup></a></span></p>
<h3 class="chapterHeadA">The Breach with William</h3>
<p class="para"><span>The impending clash between Britain and America inevitably foreshadowed a personal one between Franklin and his loyalist son. Tormented about the former prospect, Franklin remained callous about the latter.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>William, on the other hand, agonized mightily as he tried to balance his duties as a son with those of being the royal governor of New Jersey. In his letters to his father after the Cockpit fight, he hoped to curry favor by flattering him, reassuring him, and cajoling him to come home. “Your popularity in this country, whatever it may be on the other side, is greatly beyond what it ever was,” William wrote in May. “You may depend when you return here on being received with every mark of regard and affection.” He made clear, however, that he had no intention of resigning his governorship, despite his father’s occasional suggestions that he do so.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Caught in the middle was the printer William Strahan, one of Franklin’s closest friends in England, who had become a confidant of the younger Franklin as well. He urged William to be his own man, to stick to loyalist positions, and to let the ministers know that he would not let his father’s views interfere with his allegiance to the government he served.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>William heeded the advice. Shortly after writing the solicitous letter to his father, he wrote one to Lord Dartmouth, the colonial secretary. “His Majesty may be assured that I will omit nothing in my power to keep this province quiet,” he promised. Then he added pointedly, “No attachment or connections shall ever make me swerve from the duty of my station.” Translation: his loyalty to his father would not tug him away from his loyalty to Britain. Lord Dartmouth promptly responded with reassurances: “I should do injustice to my own sentiments of your character and conduct in supposing you could be induced by any consideration whatever to swerve from the duty you owe the King.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>William went further than merely offering professions of fealty. He opened what he called a “secret and confidential” correspondence with Lord Dartmouth that provided information about American sentiments. Support was growing throughout the colonies to aid Massachusetts, he warned, in reaction to the British decision to blockade Boston’s port. A meeting of colonial delegates, which would become known as the First Continental Congress, had been scheduled for Philadelphia in September. William made clear which side he was on. The proposed gathering, he declared, was “absurd if not unconstitutional,” and he doubted that it would lead to a mass boycott of British goods.<a href="part0030_split_011.html#ch_11_en_42" id="ch_11_een_42"><sup class="calibre7">42</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>His father disagreed on all counts. He had been recommending a continental congress for more than a year, he felt strongly that it should call for a boycott, and he was confident that it would. In that case, he wrote gleefully to William, “the present ministry will certainly be knocked up.” He also chided William for clinging to his governorship and, typically, cast the issue in pecuniary as well as political terms. By remaining dependent on the salary of a governor, said Franklin, he would never be able to pay off the debts he owed his father. In addition, the changing political climate meant “you will find yourself in no comfortable situation and perhaps wish you had soon disengaged yourself.” It was signed, simply, “B. Franklin.”<a href="part0030_split_011.html#ch_11_en_43" id="ch_11_een_43"><sup class="calibre7">43</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Even though he knew his letters were being opened and read by British authorities, Franklin forcefully urged his American supporters to take a firm stand. The Continental Congress, he wrote, must vote “immediately to stop all commerce with this country, both exports and imports…until you have obtained redress.” At stake was “no less than whether Americans, and their endless generations, shall enjoy the common rights of mankind or be worse than eastern slaves.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>In those days, when it could take up to two months for the mail to be delivered overseas, there were a lot of crossed letters. William continued to try to convince his father that a continental congress was a bad idea. “There is no foreseeing the consequences that may result from such a Congress.” Instead, Bostonians should make restitution for the tea they destroyed, and then “they might get their port opened in a few months.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin had actually expressed, a few months earlier, similar sentiments about how Bostonians would be prudent to pay restitution for their tea party. “Such a step will remove much of the prejudice now entertained against us,” he had written Cushing in March. It infuriated him, however, to be given such a lecture by his son, and in September he wrote a crushing response rebutting William point by point. Britain had “extorted many thousands of pounds” from the colonies unconstitutionally. “Of this money they ought to make restitution.” The argument ended in insult: “But you, who are a thorough courtier, see everything with government eyes.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin wrote his son again in October, making many of the same arguments and then turning personal: he pointedly noted that his son was behind in paying back the money he had loaned him over the years and would not likely be able to do so if he remained a royal governor.<a href="part0030_split_011.html#ch_11_en_44" id="ch_11_een_44"><sup class="calibre7">44</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>For a while there was no answer. Then, on Christmas eve of 1774, William sent his father a letter of brutal sadness and pain. Deborah had died, with Franklin not there.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>“I came here on Thursday last to attend the funeral of my poor old mother, who died Monday,” he began, referring to his stepmother.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin’s dutiful and long-suffering wife had been pining away since her stroke five years earlier. “I find myself growing very feeble very fast,” she had written in 1772. For most of 1774, she had been too weak to write at all. Oblivious, Franklin had continued to send off short notes to her, some paternalistic and others businesslike, that contained breezy references to his own health, greetings from the Stevenson family, and admonitions for not writing him.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>“A very respectable number of the inhabitants were at the funeral,” William continued. Clearly wanting his father to feel guilty, he described his last visit with Deborah that October. “She told me that she never expected to see you unless you returned this winter, that she was sure she would not live until next summer. I heartily wish you had happened to have come over in the fall, as I think her disappointment preyed a good deal on her spirits.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>At the end of the letter, William turned plaintive as he beseeched his father to leave England. “You are looked upon with an evil eye in that country, and are in no small danger of being brought into trouble for your political conduct,” William warned. “You had certainly better return while you are able to bear the fatigues of the voyage to a country where the people revere you.” He also ached to see his own son, Temple, now 14, and he begged Franklin to bring him to America. “I hope to see you and him in the spring and that you will spend some time with me.”<a href="part0030_split_011.html#ch_11_en_45" id="ch_11_een_45"><sup class="calibre7">45</sup></a></span></p>
<h3 class="chapterHeadA">The Howe–Chatham Secret Talks</h3>
<p class="para"><span>As his wife was dying that December, Franklin was enjoying a flirtatious series of chess matches with a fashionable woman he had just met in London. But the games were not merely social. They were part of a secret last-ditch effort by some members of Britain’s Whig opposition to stave off a revolution by the colonies.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>The process had begun in August, when he received a request to call on Lord Chatham, formerly William Pitt the Elder, who had served two stints as prime minister and been known as “the Great Commoner” until unwisely accepting a peerage as the Earl of Chatham. The great Whig orator was a steadfast supporter of America. By 1774, he was ailing and out of government, but he had decided to reengage in public affairs as an outspoken opponent of Lord North and his policy of colonial repression.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Lord Chatham received Franklin warmly, professed full support for the resistance by the colonies to British taxation, and said he “hoped they would continue firm.” Franklin responded by urging Chatham to join with other Whig “Wise Men” to oust the “present set of bungling ministers” and form a government that would restore the “union and harmony between Britain and her colonies.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>That was not likely, Chatham said. There were too many in England who felt that there could be no further concessions because “America aimed at setting up for itself an independent state.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>“America did not aim at independence,” Franklin claimed. “I assured him that, having more than once traveled almost from one end of the continent to the other, and kept a great variety of company, eating, drinking and conversing with them freely, I never had heard in any conversation, from any person drunk or sober, the least expression of a wish for separation.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin was not being fully forthright. It had been ten years since he had traveled in America, and he knew full well that a small but growing number of radical colonists, drunk and sober, desired independence. He had even begun entertaining that possibility himself. Josiah Quincy Jr., a zealous Boston patriot and son of an old Franklin friend, visited him that fall and reported that they had discussed “total emancipation” of the colonies as an increasingly likely outcome.<a href="part0030_split_011.html#ch_11_en_46" id="ch_11_een_46"><sup class="calibre7">46</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>The next act in the drama began with a curious invitation from a well-connected society matron who let it be known that she wanted to play chess with Franklin. The woman in question was Caroline Howe, the sister of Adm. Richard Howe and Gen. William Howe. They would eventually end up the commanders of England’s naval and land forces during the Revolution, but at the time they were both somewhat sympathetic to the American cause. (Their sister was the widow of a distant cousin, Richard Howe, and thus known as Mrs. Howe.)<a href="part0030_split_011.html#ch_11_en_47" id="ch_11_een_47"><sup class="calibre7">47</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>When Franklin called on Mrs. Howe in early December, he found her “of very sensible conversation and pleasing behavior.” They enjoyed a few games and Franklin “most readily” accepted an invitation to play again a few days later. This time, the conversation wandered. They discussed her interest in math, which Franklin noted was “a little unusual in ladies,” and then Mrs. Howe turned to politics.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>“What is to be done,” she asked, “about this dispute between Great Britain and her colonies?”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>“They should kiss and be friends,” replied Franklin.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>“I have often said that I wished the government would employ you to settle the dispute,” she said. “I am sure nobody could do it so well. Don’t you think that the thing is practicable?”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>“Undoubtedly, madam, if the parties are disposed to reconciliation,” he responded. “The two countries really have no clashing interests.” It was a matter that “reasonable people might settle in half an hour.” He added, however, that “the ministers will never think of employing me in that good work; they choose rather to abuse me.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>“Aye,” she agreed, “they have behaved shamefully to you. And indeed some of them are now ashamed of it themselves.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Later that same evening, Franklin dined with two old friends, the Quakers John Fothergill and David Barclay, who made the same plea that he act as a mediator. “Put pen to paper,” they urged him, and draft a plan for reconciliation.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>And so he did. His “Hints for a Conversation” included seventeen points, among them: Massachusetts would pay for the destroyed tea, the tea duties would be repealed, the regulations on colonial manufacturing would be reconsidered, all money raised by trade duties would go to the colonial treasuries, no troops would be stationed in a colony without the approval of its legislature, and all powers of taxation would reside with the colonial legislatures rather than Parliament. His friends asked permission to show the list to some “moderate ministers,” and Franklin agreed.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>These private negotiations were interrupted in mid-December, when Franklin finally received the resolutions that had been approved by the First Continental Congress. At its meeting in Philadelphia, which lasted until late October, the rump assembly had reasserted America’s loyalty to the Crown—but not to Parliament. In addition, it voted a boycott of British goods if Parliament did not repeal its coercive acts.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Many of the colonial agents in London refused to have anything to do with the resolutions when they arrived. So Franklin and the other agents from Massachusetts took it upon themselves to deliver them to Lord Dartmouth, who “told us it was a decent and proper petition and cheerfully undertook to present it to his Majesty.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>On Christmas day, Franklin visited Mrs. Howe for another chess match. As soon as he arrived, she mentioned that her brother, Admiral Lord Richard Howe, wanted to meet him. “Will you give me leave to send for him?” she asked.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin readily agreed, and soon he was listening as Lord Howe showered him with compliments. “No man could do more towards reconciling our differences,” the admiral told him. He asked Franklin to offer some suggestions, which he would then communicate to the proper ministers.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin, wary of being caught in the middle, noted that the Continental Congress had made clear what the colonies wanted. But he agreed to another secret session a week later, again under the guise of visiting Mrs. Howe to play chess.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>This time, the meeting was not quite as cordial. Lord Howe asked Franklin if he thought it might be useful for England to send an emissary to America to seek an accommodation. It might “be of great use,” Franklin responded, as long as the person was one of “rank and dignity.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Mrs. Howe interjected by nominating her brother for such a role, subtly noting that there was talk of sending over their other brother, the army general, on a less peaceful mission. “I wish, brother, you were to be sent thither on such a service,” she said. “I should like that much better than General Howe’s going to command the army there.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>“I think, madam,” Franklin said pointedly, “they ought to provide for General Howe some more honorable employment.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Lord Howe then pulled out a piece of paper and asked if Franklin knew anything about it. It was a copy of the “Hints for a Conversation” that he had prepared. Franklin said that his role in drawing up the paper was supposed to be a secret, but he readily owned up to having been the originator. Howe replied that he “was rather sorry” to find that the propositions were Franklin’s, because there was no likelihood that the ministers would accept them. He urged Franklin to reconsider the proposals and come up with a new plan “that would be acceptable.” Mrs. Howe could recopy it in her own hand, so that the authorship would be kept secret. If Franklin did so, Lord Howe hinted, he could “expect any reward in the power of the government to bestow.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin bristled at the implied bribe. “This to me was what the French call ‘spitting in the soup,’ ” he later noted. Nevertheless, Franklin found himself trusting Lord Howe and decided to play along. “I liked his manner,” he noted, “and found myself disposed to place great confidence in him.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>The paper he sent to Mrs. Howe the next day made no substantive concessions. Instead, it merely restated the American position and declared them necessary “to cement a cordial union.” Although the talks with Howe continued fitfully through February, fueled mainly by the admiral’s ambition to be chosen as an envoy, they never moved much closer to a solution.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>In the meantime, Franklin was engaged in a variety of other back-channel talks and negotiations, most notably with Lord Chatham. The former prime minister invited him to his country house to show him a series of proposals he planned to put before Parliament, and then visited him for two hours on Craven Street for further discussions. Lord Chatham’s presence at Franklin’s humble boarding-house—his coach waiting very visibly in the narrow street outside the door—caused quite a stir in the neighborhood. “Such a visit from so great a man, on so important a business, flattered not a little my vanity,” Franklin admitted. It was particularly savory because it fell precisely on the first anniversary of his humiliation in the Cockpit.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>The compromise that Chatham proposed, as the two men sat together in the tiny parlor of Mrs. Stevenson’s house, would permit Parliament to regulate imperial trade and to send troops to America. But only the colonial legislatures would have the right to impose taxes, and the Continental Congress would be given official and permanent standing. Although Franklin did not approve of all its particulars, he readily agreed to lend his support by being present when Chatham presented the plan to the House of Lords on February 1.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Chatham gave an eloquent explanation of his proposals, and Lord Dartmouth responded for the government by saying they were of “such weight and magnitude as to require much consideration.” For a moment, Franklin felt that all of his back-channel talks and lobbying might be bearing fruit.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Then Lord Sandwich, who as first lord of the admiralty had taken a hard line on colonial affairs, took the floor. In a “petulant, vehement speech,” he attacked Chatham’s bill and then turned his aim on Franklin. He could not believe, he said, that the plan came from the pen of an English peer. Instead, it appeared to him the work of some American. As Franklin recounted the scene: “Turning his face to me, [he] said he fancied he had in his eye the person who drew it up, one of the bitterest and most mischievous enemies this country had ever known. This drew the eyes of many lords upon me; but…I kept my countenance as immovable as if my features had been made of wood.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Chatham replied that the plan was his own, but he was not ashamed to have consulted “a person so perfectly acquainted with the whole of American affairs as the gentleman alluded to and so injuriously reflected on.” He then proceeded to heap praise on Franklin as a person “whom all Europe held in high estimation for his knowledge and wisdom and ranked with our Boyles and Newtons; who was an honor not to the English nation only but to human nature.” Franklin later wrote to his son, with perhaps a bit of feigned humility, “I found it harder to stand this extravagant compliment than the preceding equally extravagant abuse.”<a href="part0030_split_011.html#ch_11_en_48" id="ch_11_een_48"><sup class="calibre7">48</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>But Chatham was not only out of power, he was out of touch. Lord Dartmouth quickly abandoned his initial openness and agreed with Lord Sandwich that the bill should be rejected immediately, which it was. “Chatham’s bill,” Franklin wrote to a Philadelphia friend, “was treated with as much contempt as they could have shown to a ballad offered by a drunken porter.”<a href="part0030_split_011.html#ch_11_en_49" id="ch_11_een_49"><sup class="calibre7">49</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>For the next few weeks, Franklin engaged in a flurry of further meetings designed to salvage some compromise. But by early March 1775, as he finally prepared to leave England, his patience had run out. He drew up an insolent petition to Lord Dartmouth demanding British reparations for the blockade of Boston Harbor. When he showed it to his friend and land deal partner Thomas Walpole, “he looked at it and me several times alternately, as if he apprehended me a little out of my senses.” Franklin returned to his senses and decided not to submit the petition.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Instead, he played a small role in one of the final and most eloquent pleas for peace. He spent the afternoon of March 19 with the great Whig orator and philosopher Edmund Burke. Three days later, Burke rose in Parliament to give his famous but futile “On Conciliation with America” speech. “A great empire and little minds go ill together,” he proclaimed.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>By then, Franklin was already on the Philadelphia packet ship heading west from Portsmouth. He had spent his last day in London with his old friend and scientific partner Joseph Priestley. People who did not know Franklin, Priestley wrote, sometimes found him reserved, even cold. But that day, as they discussed the looming war and read from the newspapers, he grew very emotional. For a while, the tears in his eyes made it impossible for him to read.<a href="part0030_split_011.html#ch_11_en_50" id="ch_11_een_50"><sup class="calibre7">50</sup></a></span></p>
