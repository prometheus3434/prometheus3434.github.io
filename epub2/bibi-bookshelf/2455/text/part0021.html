<h3 class="chapterHeadA">Minister Plenipotentiary</h3>
<p class="para"><span>By the summer of 1778, it had become clear to all three American commissioners that there should be only one person in charge. Not only was it difficult for the three of them to agree on policies, Franklin told the Congress, but it was now even difficult for them to work in the same house together. Even their servants were quarreling. In addition, the French had appointed a minister plenipotentiary to America, and protocol demanded that the new nation reciprocate with an appointee of similar rank. Arthur Lee nominated himself and conspired with his brothers to win the prize. John Adams more graciously suggested to friends that Franklin, despite his work habits and softness toward France, would be best. Franklin did not overtly push for the job, but he did strongly ask the Congress, in July 1778, to “separate us.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>The French did Franklin’s lobbying for him. They let it be known that he was their choice, and the Congress complied in September by electing him the sole minister plenipotentiary. The vote was 12–1, the dissenting state being Pennsylvania, where his enemies questioned his loyalty and that of his grandson Temple, the son of an imprisoned loyalist governor.<a href="part0030_split_015.html#ch_15_en_1" id="ch_15_een_1"><sup class="calibre7">1</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Word of his appointment did not reach Paris until February 1779, for the war and the winter hindered the passage of American ships. When it did, Arthur Lee sulked and refused to hand over his papers to Franklin. As for Adams, his biographer David McCullough writes, “The new arrangement was exactly what Adams had recommended and the news was to leave him feeling more miserable than ever.” He soon left Paris, at least for the time being, to make his way back to Massachusetts.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin was suffering from the gout and could not immediately present his new credentials, but in late March he paid a call on the king and his ministers. Mindful of Adams’s hurt feelings, Franklin worked to keep their relationship cordial. He wrote Adams a polite and amusing letter in which he described his rounds at Versailles and complained that “the fatigue however was a little too much for my feet and disabled me for near another week.” In his own letters, Adams kept up a collegial façade, and he even expressed some support for Franklin’s deep fealty to the French, despite his own doubts about the wisdom of becoming too aligned with them. “I am much pleased with your reception at court in the new character,” he replied, “and I do not doubt that your opinion of the good will of this court to the United States is just.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Adams’s fragile equanimity was shaken, however, when Franklin and the French decided to commandeer the ship that was supposed to take him home and assign it to be part of the fleet that John Paul Jones planned to use against the British (of which more below). Well aware that Adams was impatiently waiting at the port of Nantes to set sail, Franklin was apologetic, and he even got the powerful French naval minister Antoine de Sartine to write a letter explaining the decision. Another ship would be assigned to take him home as soon as feasible, Franklin promised, and it would allow Adams the benefit of traveling with the new French minister to the United States.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Adams pretended to be understanding: “The public service must not be obstructed for the private convenience of an individual, and the honor of a passage with the new Ambassador should be a compensation to me for the loss of the prospect of so speedy a return home.” Showing just a touch of the polite hypocrisy that he was generally famed for lacking, Adams even went so far as to ask Franklin to “oblige me much by making my compliments [to] Madame Brillon and Madame Helvétius, ladies for whose characters I have a great respect.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>But as he brooded in port, Adams became increasingly bitter. After dining with Jones, he declared that the captain was a man of “eccentricities and irregularities,” and he grew furious at the thought that Jones and Franklin were conspiring to delay his trip home. “It is decreed that I shall endure all sorts of mortifications,” he wrote in his diary. “Do I see that these people despise me, or do I see that they dread me?” Inevitably, he began to ascribe dark motives to Franklin. Simmering in self-importance, Adams began to suspect that Franklin was hindering his return because he feared the “dangerous truths” he might reveal. “Does the Old Conjurer dread my voice in Congress?” Adams wrote in his diary. “He had some reason, for he has often heard it there, a terror to evil doers.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin was blithely oblivious of Adams’s dark suspicions, and he carried on trying to be cordial in his letters. “I shall take care to present your respects to the good ladies you mention,” he cheerfully promised. He even agreed, after three strident requests from Adams, that the new ship might go directly to Boston, rather than accommodating the French minister by going to Philadelphia first. But it was to no avail. New specters of distrust had infected Adams’s mind, and they were destined to haunt his relationship with Franklin when he returned the following year.<a href="part0030_split_015.html#ch_15_en_2" id="ch_15_een_2"><sup class="calibre7">2</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>While Adams simmered, Arthur Lee and his brothers declared open war on Franklin back in America. Lee circulated a letter accusing Franklin of “weaving little plots” and “sowing pernicious dissension,” and he also made sure that the Congress saw the flurry of accusatory letters to Franklin, questioning his honor, that he and Ralph Izard had written earlier that year.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Warned by his son-in-law, Richard Bache, of all these intrigues, Franklin was able to dismiss the resentments of the Lees. “My too great reputation,” he wrote, “grieve those unhappy gentlemen, unhappy in their tempers and in the dark, uncomfortable passions of jealousy, anger, suspicion, envy and malice.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>He was, however, far more wounded by Bache’s reports that Lee and his allies were attacking Temple, for he loved his grandson with a blindness that was unusual for him. “Izard, Lees &amp; company,” Bache wrote, “lay some stress upon your employing as a private secretary your grandson whom they hold unfit to be trusted because of his father’s principles.” Then he added ominously, “They have had some thoughts of bringing a motion to have him removed.” In a separate note, Sally Bache confided that her husband had been afraid to inform Franklin of this campaign against Temple because he knew it would upset him.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>It certainly did. “Methinks it is rather some merit that I have rescued a valuable young man from the danger of being a Tory,” he wrote Richard. Then he let loose a cry of anger at the thought that Temple might be recalled:</span></p>
<div class="extract">
<p class="extractText"><span>It is enough that I have lost my <span class="italic"><span>son;</span></span> would they add my <span class="italic"><span>grandson!</span></span> An old man of seventy, I undertook a winter voyage at the command of the Congress, and for the public service, with no other attendant to take care of me. I am continued here in a foreign country, where, if I am sick, his filial attention comforts me, and if I die, I have a child to close my eyes and take care of my remains.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="para"><span>In a letter to Sally at the same time, he repeated these sentiments and added that trying to deprive him of Temple would be cruel but futile. “I should not part with the child, but with the employment,” he threatened. “But I am confident that, whatever may be proposed by weak or malicious people, the Congress is too wise and too good to think of treating me in that manner.” The Congress was indeed supportive. There was no serious effort to have Temple dismissed, and he remained the secretary to the American delegation.<a href="part0030_split_015.html#ch_15_en_3" id="ch_15_een_3"><sup class="calibre7">3</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Temple was about 19 at the time, still a roguish lad who worked hard but had earned the deep respect of few besides his grandfather. As the controversy swirled around him in the summer of 1779, he decided to prove his mettle by taking part in an audacious mission with Lafayette to launch a surprise attack on Britain itself.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>The French general, less than three years older than Temple, had recently returned from serving under George Washington. By this time, the Revolution had reached an unsteady stalemate, with British troops under Sir Henry Clinton still ensconced in New York but doing little for the time being other than conducting hit-and-run raids. So Lafayette, on arriving back in Paris, hatched his audacious plan to attack the British mainland, and he shared it with Franklin and the French military. “I admire much the activity of your genius,” Franklin wrote. “It is certain that the coasts of England and Scotland are extremely open and defenseless.” He conceded that he did not know enough about military strategy to “presume upon advising it.” But he could give encouragement. “Many instances of history prove that in war, attempts thought to be impossible do often, for that very reason, become possible and practicable because nobody expects them.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Lafayette was eager to have Temple at his side. “We will be always together during the campaign, which I do assure you gives me great pleasure,” he wrote the young man. For his part, Temple, ever the dandy, fretted about his rank, his title, his commission, and his uniform. He wanted to be commissioned as an officer rather than merely as a volunteer, and he insisted on the right to wear the epaulettes of an officer, even though Lafayette advised against it. Just as all these issues were being settled, the land invasion was called off by the French military.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin professed to be disappointed. “I flattered myself,” he wrote Lafayette, “that he might possibly catch from you some tincture of those engaging manners that make you so much the delight of all that know you.” Once again, Temple’s chance to make a name for himself on his own was scuttled.<a href="part0030_split_015.html#ch_15_en_4" id="ch_15_een_4"><sup class="calibre7">4</sup></a></span></p>
<h3 class="chapterHeadA">John Paul Jones</h3>
<p class="para"><span>One component of the proposed invasion of Britain did proceed, and it inserted a colorful character into Franklin’s life. When Lafayette was first planning his mission, Franklin told him that “much will depend on a prudent and brave sea commander who knows the coasts.” They settled instead for a commander who was, as Franklin was already well aware, more brave than prudent: John Paul Jones.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Born John Paul, the son of a Scottish landscape designer, he had shipped off to sea at age 13, served as the first mate of a slave vessel, and soon commanded his own merchant ship. But the hotheaded captain, who throughout his career was prone to provoking mutinies, got into trouble by flogging a crew member who later died and then, after being exonerated, running his sword through yet another crew member who was threatening an insurrection. So he fled to Virginia, changed his last name to Jones, and at the beginning of the Revolution won a commission in America’s motley navy of ex-privateers and adventurers. By 1778, he was making his reputation by conducting daring attacks along the English and Scottish coasts.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>On one of these raids, Jones decided to kidnap a Scottish earl, but the man was away taking the waters down in Bath, so the crew instead forced his wife to hand over the family silver. In a fit of noble guilt, Jones decided to buy the booty from his crew so that he could return it to the family, and he wrote a flowery letter to the earl declaring his intention, copies of which he circulated to various friends, including Franklin, who had by then assumed the difficult task of acting as his American overseer as well as his occasional host in Passy. Franklin tried to help Jones resolve the problem, but it led to such a convoluted exchange of letters with the outraged earl and his baffled wife that the silver was not returned until after the end of the war.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin decided that the impetuous captain would do more good, or less harm, if he focused his raids on the Channel Islands instead. “The Jersey privateers do us a great deal of mischief,” he wrote to Jones in May 1778. “It has been mentioned to me that your small vessel, commanded by so brave an officer, might render great service by following them where greater ships dare not venture.” He added that the suggestion came “from high authority,” meaning the great French naval minister Antoine Sartine.<a href="part0030_split_015.html#ch_15_en_5" id="ch_15_een_5"><sup class="calibre7">5</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Jones, not so easily managed, replied that his ship, <span class="italic"><span>Ranger,</span></span> was too “crank and slow,” and it would require promises of great reward for him to convince his men to undertake more missions. But he knew how to flatter Franklin: he sent him a copy of his battle journals, which Franklin read avidly. So, without permission from his fellow commissioners or from France, Franklin decided that Jones should be given command of a ship that had just been built for the Americans in Amsterdam. Alas, the nervous Dutch, who were trying to remain neutral, scuttled the plan, especially after the British, who had learned of it through their spy Bancroft, applied pressure.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin was finally able to help secure for Jones, in February 1779, an old forty-gun man-of-war named the <span class="italic"><span>Duras,</span></span> which Jones promptly rechristened the <span class="italic"><span>Bonhomme Richard</span></span> in his patron’s honor. Jones was so thrilled that he paid a visit to Passy that month to thank Franklin and his landlord Chaumont, who had helped supply Jones with uniforms and funds. There was perhaps another reason for the visit: Jones may have been having an illicit affair with Madame de Chaumont.<a href="part0030_split_015.html#ch_15_en_6" id="ch_15_een_6"><sup class="calibre7">6</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>During this stay, an incident occurred that, as played out in subsequent letters, resembled a French farce. A wizened old woman, who was the wife of the Chaumonts’ gardener, alleged that Jones tried to rape her. Franklin made a passing allusion to the alleged incident in a postscript to a subsequent letter, and Jones mistakenly assumed that “the mystery you so delicately mention” referred to the controversy that surrounded his killing of the rebellious crew member years earlier. So he provided a long and anguished account of that old travail.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Confused and somewhat amused by Jones’s detailed explanation of impaling the mutineer, Franklin replied that he had never heard that story and informed Jones that the “mystery” he alluded to referred, instead, to an allegation made by the gardener’s wife that Jones had “attempted to ravish her” in the bushes of the estate at “about 7 o’clock the evening before your departure.” The woman had recounted the horror in great detail, “some of which are not fit for me to write,” and three of her sons had declared that they “were determined to kill you.” But Jones should not worry: everyone at Passy found the tale to be the subject of great merriment. It “occasioned some laughing,” wrote Franklin, “the old woman being one of the grossest, coarsest, dirtiest and ugliest that one may find in a thousand.” Madame Chaumont, whose own familiarity with Jones’s sexual appetites did not prevent her from a great display of French insouciance, declared that “it gave a high idea of the strength of appetite and courage of the Americans.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>They all ended up concluding, Franklin assured Jones, that it must have been a case of mistaken identity. As part of the Mardi Gras festivities, a chamber girl had apparently dressed up in one of his uniforms and, so they surmised, attacked the gardener’s wife as a prank. It seems quite implausible that the gardener’s wife, even in the dimness of early evening, could have been so easily fooled—not even their friend Beaumarchais would have attempted such a cross-dressing rape scene in <span class="italic"><span>The Marriage of Figaro</span></span>—but the explanation was satisfactory enough that the event was not mentioned in subsequent letters.<a href="part0030_split_015.html#ch_15_en_7" id="ch_15_een_7"><sup class="calibre7">7</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>All of this occurred just as Franklin was helping to plan the proposed sneak attack on Britain by Jones and Lafayette, who had both arrived at Passy and were spending hours warily assessing one another under Franklin’s worried eye. Both officers were proud, and they were soon struggling over matters large and small, ranging from who would be in charge of various aspects of the invasion to whether their men would eat at the same tables. Franklin resorted to his most indirect manner in trying to soothe Jones. “It has been observed that joint expeditions of land and sea forces often miscarry through jealousies and misunderstandings between the officers of different corps,” he pointed out. Then, saying almost the opposite of what he truly felt, he added, “Knowing you both as I do and your just manner of thinking on these occasions, I am confident nothing of the kind can happen between you.” But Franklin made it clear that he was concerned, quite understandably, about Jones’s temperament. “A cool, prudent conduct” was necessary, he cautioned. Jones must remember that Lafayette was the ranking officer, and it would be “a kind of trial of your abilities and of your fitness in temper and disposition for acting in concert with others.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>In his formal set of instructions to Jones, Franklin was even more explicit in ordering him to show restraint, especially in light of his crew’s previous plundering of the Scottish earl’s silver. “Although the English have wantonly burnt many defenseless towns in America, you are not to follow this example, unless where a reasonable ransom is refused; in which case your own generous feelings, as well as this instruction, will induce you to give timely notice of your intention, so that sick and ancient persons, women and children, may be first removed.” Replied Jones, “Your liberal and noble minded instructions would make a coward brave.”<a href="part0030_split_015.html#ch_15_en_8" id="ch_15_een_8"><sup class="calibre7">8</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>When Lafayette’s part of the mission was scrapped, Franklin and the French decided that Jones should proceed with a purely naval attack, which he did in September 1779. The result was the fabled sea battle between the <span class="italic"><span>Bonhomme Richard</span></span> and the much better-equipped <span class="italic"><span>Serapis.</span></span> When the British captain, after applying a fierce pounding, asked him to surrender, Jones replied, at least according to legend, “I have not yet begun to fight!” As Jones put it in his vivid and detailed account of the battle to Franklin, “I answered him in the most determined negative.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Jones was able to lash the <span class="italic"><span>Bonhomme Richard</span></span> into a death grip with the <span class="italic"><span>Serapis,</span></span> and his men scrambled up the masts to lob grenades into the ammunition holds of the enemy ship. After a three-hour battle, in which half of his three hundred crew members were killed or wounded, Jones captured control of the <span class="italic"><span>Serapis</span></span> just before the <span class="italic"><span>Bonhomme Richard</span></span> sank. “The scene was dreadful beyond the reach of language,” he wrote Franklin. “Humanity cannot but recoil and lament that war should be capable of producing such fatal consequences.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin took great pride in Jones’s success, and they became even closer friends. “Scarce anything was talked of at Paris and Versailles but your cool conduct and persevering bravery during that terrible conflict,” he replied. He helped to get Jones, who was desperately eager to gain social respect, initiated into the Nine Sisters Masonic Lodge, and he accompanied him on a triumphal visit to the king at Versailles. Franklin even got embroiled in Jones’s lengthy and bitter disputes with the insubordinate Pierre Landais, captain of the <span class="italic"><span>Alliance,</span></span> which was supposed to be part of Jones’s fleet. Landais had failed to come to the rescue during the battle with the <span class="italic"><span>Serapis,</span></span> and in fact had actually fired on the <span class="italic"><span>Bonhomme Richard.</span></span> For the next two years, Franklin and Jones fought with Landais, who was supported by Arthur Lee, over who should be the captain of the <span class="italic"><span>Alliance.</span></span> When Landais finally commandeered the vessel and sailed away, a beleaguered Franklin decided it was best to let others sort it all out. He had other things in France to deal with.<a href="part0030_split_015.html#ch_15_en_9" id="ch_15_een_9"><sup class="calibre7">9</sup></a></span></p>
<h3 class="chapterHeadA">Friend of the Court</h3>
<p class="para"><span>The absence of John Adams from Paris, so pleasing both to Franklin and the French court, was too good to last. He had left, in a mood even more sour than usual, after Franklin was made the sole minister to France, but he had been home only a few months when the Congress decided to send him back to Paris. His new official mission was to negotiate a peace accord with the British, if and when the time ever became ripe. As the time was not, in fact, ripe for such talks, Adams contented himself by meddling in Franklin’s duties.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>This thoroughly annoyed the French foreign minister Vergennes. When Adams proposed, on his arrival in February 1780, to make public his authority to negotiate with the British, Vergennes invoked the American promise not to act independently of France. He should say and do nothing. “Above all,” Vergennes sternly instructed him, “take the necessary precautions that the object of your commission remain unknown to the Court of London.”<a href="part0030_split_015.html#ch_15_en_10" id="ch_15_een_10"><sup class="calibre7">10</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin was also annoyed. Adams’s return threatened to disrupt his careful cultivation of the French court, and it reminded him of the attacks on his reputation that had long been waged by the Adams and Lee family factions in the Congress. In a ruminative mood, he wrote Washington a letter that ostensibly offered reassurance about the general’s reputation but clearly reflected his worries about his own. “I must soon quit the scene,” Franklin wrote, in an unusually introspective way, referring not to his post in France but his life in this world. Washington’s own great reputation in France, he said, was “free from those little shades that the jealousy and envy of a man’s countrymen and contemporaries are ever endeavoring to cast over living merit.” It was clear that he was trying to reassure not only Washington but also himself that history would ignore “the feeble voice of those groveling passions.”<a href="part0030_split_015.html#ch_15_en_11" id="ch_15_een_11"><sup class="calibre7">11</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>More specifically, Franklin sought to explain, to himself and his friends (and also to history), why Adams rather than he had been chosen to negotiate any potential peace with Britain. Just as Adams was arriving, Franklin wrote a letter to his old friend David Hartley, a member of Parliament with whom he had previously discussed prisoner exchanges and peace feelers. Hartley had proposed a ten-year truce between Britain and America. Franklin replied that it was his “private opinion” that a truce might make sense, but he noted that “neither you nor I are at present authorized” to negotiate such matters. That authority now resided with Adams, and Franklin put his own spin on the Congress’s choice: “If the Congress have therefore entrusted to others rather than to me the negotiations for peace, when such shall be set on foot, as has been reported, it is perhaps because they may have heard of a very singular opinion of mine, that there hardly ever existed such a thing as a bad peace, or a good war, and that I might therefore easily be induced to make improper concessions.”<a href="part0030_split_015.html#ch_15_en_12" id="ch_15_een_12"><sup class="calibre7">12</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin had indeed often used the phrase about there being no such thing as a bad peace or a good war, and he would repeat it to dozens of other friends after the Revolution ended. It is sometimes used as an antiwar slogan and cited to cast Franklin as one of history’s noble pacifists. But that is misleading. Throughout his life, Franklin supported wars when he felt they were warranted; he had helped form militias in Philadelphia and raised supplies for the battles with the French and Indians. Though he had initially worked to avert the Revolution, he supported it strongly when he decided that independence was inevitable. The sentiments in his letter were aimed both at Hartley and at history. He wanted to explain why he had not been chosen as a peace negotiator. Perhaps more intriguing, he also wanted to let his friends in Britain know that he could eventually provide a good channel, better than Adams, if the talks ever began.<a href="part0030_split_015.html#ch_15_en_13" id="ch_15_een_13"><sup class="calibre7">13</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>In the meantime, Franklin was ardently committed to the French alliance, more so than most of his American colleagues. This led to a great public rift with Adams after his return in early 1780. Previously, the tension between the two men had been based more on their differences in personality and style, but this one was caused by a fundamental disagreement over policy: whether or not America should show gratitude, allegiance, and fealty to France.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>In the early days of the Revolution, both men shared a somewhat isolationist or exceptionalist view, one that has since been a thread throughout American history: the United States should never be a supplicant in seeking support from other nations, and it should be coy and cautious about entering into entangling foreign alliances. Even after he began his love affair with France in 1777, Franklin restated this principle. “I have never yet changed the opinion I gave in Congress that a virgin state should preserve the virgin character, and not go about suitoring for alliances,” he assured Arthur Lee. In negotiating the alliance with France, he had successfully resisted making any concessions that would give a monopoly over American trade or favors.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Once the treaties were signed in early 1778, however, Franklin became a strong believer in showing gratitude and loyalty. In the words of diplomatic historian Gerald Stourzh, he “extolled the magnanimity and generosity of France in terms which at times touch on the slightly ridiculous.” America’s fealty to France, in Franklin’s view, was based on idealism as well as realism, and he described it in moral terms rather than merely in the cold calculus of commercial advantages and European power balances. “This is really a generous nation, fond of glory, and particularly that of protecting the oppressed,” he declared of France in a letter to the Congress. “Telling them their <span class="italic"><span>commerce</span></span> will be advantaged by our success, and that it is their <span class="italic"><span>interest</span></span> to help us, seems as much to say, ‘help us and we shall not be obliged to you.’ Such indiscreet and improper language has been sometimes held here by some of our people, and produced no good effects.”<a href="part0030_split_015.html#ch_15_en_14" id="ch_15_een_14"><sup class="calibre7">14</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Adams, on the other hand, was much more of a cold realist. He felt that France had supported America because of its own national interests—weakening Britain, gaining a lucrative new trading relationship—and neither side owed the other any moral gratitude. France, he correctly predicted, would help America only up to a point; it wanted the new nation to break with Britain but not to become so strong that it no longer needed France’s support. Franklin showed too much subservience to the court, Adams felt, and on his return in 1780 he forcefully propounded this view. “We ought to be cautious,” Adams wrote the Congress in April, “how we magnify our ideas and exaggerate our expressions of the generosity and magnanimity of any of those powers.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Vergennes, not surprisingly, was eager to deal only with Franklin, and by the end of July 1780 he had exchanged enough strained correspondence with Adams—on everything from American currency revaluation to the deployment of the French navy—that he felt justified in sending him a stinging letter that managed to be both formally diplomatic and undiplomatic at the same time. On behalf of the court of Louis XVI, he declared, “The King did not stand in need of your solicitations to direct his attentions to the interests of the United States.” In other words, France would not deal with Adams any longer.<a href="part0030_split_015.html#ch_15_en_15" id="ch_15_een_15"><sup class="calibre7">15</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Vergennes informed Franklin of this decision and sent him copies of all his testy correspondence with Adams, with the request that Franklin “lay the whole before Congress.” In his reply, Franklin was exceedingly candid with Vergennes, indeed dangerously so, in revealing his own frustration with Adams. “It was from his particular indiscretion alone, and not from any instructions received by him, that he has given such just cause of displeasure.” Franklin went on to explicitly distance himself from Adams’s activities. “He has never yet communicated to me more of his business in Europe than I have seen in the newspapers,” Franklin told Vergennes. “I live upon terms of civility with him, not of intimacy.” He concluded by promising to send the Congress the offending Adams correspondence that Vergennes had supplied.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Although Franklin could have, and perhaps should have, dispatched the letters without comment, he took the opportunity to write (“with reluctance”) a letter of his own to the Congress that detailed his disagreement with Adams. Their dispute was partly due to a difference in style. Adams believed in blunt assertions of American interests, whereas Franklin favored suasion and diplomatic charm. But the dispute was also caused by a fundamental difference in philosophy. Adams believed that America’s foreign policy should be based on realism; Franklin believed that it should also include an element of idealism, both as a moral duty and as a component of America’s national interests. As Franklin put it in his letter:</span></p>
<div class="extract">
<p class="extractText"><span>Mr. Adams…thinks, as he tells me himself, that America has been too free in expressions of gratitude to France; for that she is more obliged to us than we to her; and that we should show spirit in our applications. I apprehend that he mistakes his ground, and that this Court is to be treated with decency and delicacy. The King, a young and virtuous prince, has, I am persuaded, a pleasure in reflecting on the generous benevolence of the action in assisting an oppressed people, and proposes it as a part of the glory of his reign. I think it right to increase this pleasure by our thankful acknowledgments, and that such an expression of gratitude is not only our duty, but our interest.<a href="part0030_split_015.html#ch_15_en_16" id="ch_15_een_16"><sup class="calibre7">16</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="para"><span>With the British not yet ready to deal with him and the French no longer willing to deal with him, Adams once again left Paris feeling resentful. And Franklin once again tried to keep their disagreements from becoming personal. He wrote to Adams in Holland, where he had gone to try to elicit a loan for America, and commiserated about the difficulties of that task. “I have long been humiliated,” he said, “with the idea of our running from court to court begging for money and friendship.” And in a subsequent letter complaining about how long France was taking to answer his own requests, Franklin wryly wrote Adams: “I have, however, two of the Christian graces, faith and hope. But my faith is only that of which the apostle speaks, the evidence of things not seen.” If their mutual endeavors failed, he added, “I shall be ready to break, run away, or go to prison with you, as it shall please God.”<a href="part0030_split_015.html#ch_15_en_17" id="ch_15_een_17"><sup class="calibre7">17</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>America’s need for more money had indeed become quite desperate by the end of 1780. Earlier in the year, the British commander Sir Henry Clinton had sailed south from New York, with General Cornwallis as his deputy, to launch an attack on Charleston, South Carolina. It succeeded in May, and Cornwallis set up a British command there after Clinton returned to New York. Also that summer, the troubled American general Benedict Arnold had turned coat in a way that made his name synonymous with treachery. “Our present situation,” Washington wrote Franklin in October of that year, “makes one of two things essential to us: a peace, or the most vigorous aid of our allies, particularly in the article of money.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin thus resorted to all of his wiles—personal pleadings mixed with appeals to idealism and national interests—in his application to Vergennes in February 1781. “I am grown old,” he said, adding that his illness made it probable that he would soon retire. “The present conjuncture is critical.” If more money did not come soon, the Congress could lose its influence, the new government would be stillborn, and England would recover control over America. That, he warned, would tilt the balance of power in a way that “will enable them to become the Terror of Europe and to exercise with impunity that insolence which is so natural to their nation.”<a href="part0030_split_015.html#ch_15_en_18" id="ch_15_een_18"><sup class="calibre7">18</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>His request was audacious: 25 million livres.<a href="part0021.html#ft_5"><sup class="calibre7">*</sup></a> In the end, France agreed to provide 6 million, which was a great victory for Franklin and enough money to keep American hopes alive.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin, however, was disheartened. Back home, his enemies were being as vindictive as ever. “The political salvation of America depends upon the recalling of Dr. Franklin,” Ralph Izard wrote Richard Lee. Even Vergennes expressed some doubts that made their way back to the Congress. “Although I have a high esteem for M. Franklin,” he wrote to his minister in Philadelphia, “I am nevertheless obliged to concede that his age and his love of tranquility produce an apathy incompatible with the affairs in his charge.” Izard pushed a recall vote that was supported by the Lee–Adams faction. Although Franklin easily survived, the Congress did decide to send a special envoy to take over the work of handling future financial transactions.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>So, in March, after receiving word of France’s new loan, Franklin informed the Congress that he was ready to resign. “I have passed my 75th year,” he wrote, adding that he was plagued by gout and weakness. “I do not know that my mental faculties are impaired; perhaps I shall be the last to discover that.” Having served in public life for fifty years, he had received “honor sufficient to satisfy any reasonable ambition, and I have no other left but that of repose, which I hope Congress will grant me.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>He included one personal request: that the members find a job for his grandson Temple, who had passed up the chance to study law so that he could serve his country in Paris. “If they shall think fit to employ him as a secretary to their minister at any European court, I am persuaded they will have reason to be satisfied with his conduct, and I shall be thankful for his appointment as a favor to me.”<a href="part0030_split_015.html#ch_15_en_20" id="ch_15_een_20"><sup class="calibre7">20</sup></a></span></p>
<h3 class="chapterHeadA">Peace Commissioner</h3>
<p class="para"><span>The Congress refused Franklin’s offer to resign. Instead, in what came as a pleasant surprise, he was not only kept on as minister to France, he was also given an additional role: one of the five commissioners to handle the peace negotiations with Britain if and when the time came for an end to the war. The others were John Adams (who originally had been designated the sole negotiator and was at the time still in Holland), Thomas Jefferson (who again declined the overseas assignment for personal reasons), South Carolina planter-merchant Henry Laurens (who was captured at sea by the British and imprisoned in the Tower of London), and New York lawyer John Jay.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin’s selection was controversial, and it came partly because of pressure from Vergennes. Despite his doubts about Franklin’s energy, the French minister instructed his envoy in Philadelphia to lobby on his behalf and inform the Congress that his conduct “is as zealous and patriotic as it is wise and circumspect.” Vergennes also asked the Congress to require that the new delegation take no steps without France’s approval. The Congress complied by giving its commissioners strict instructions “to make the most candid and confidential communications upon all subjects to the ministers of our generous ally, the King of France; to undertake nothing in the negotiations for peace or truce without their knowledge and concurrence.”<a href="part0030_split_015.html#ch_15_en_21" id="ch_15_een_21"><sup class="calibre7">21</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Adams was appalled at being so shackled to France’s will, and he called the instructions “shameful.” Jay agreed, declaring that by “casting herself into the arms of the King of France” America would not “advance either her interest or her reputation.” Franklin, on the other hand, was pleased with the instructions to follow France’s guidance. “I have had so much experience of his majesty’s goodness to us,” he wrote the Congress, “and of the sincerity of this upright and able minister [Vergennes], that I cannot but think the confidence well and judiciously placed and that it will have happy effects.”<a href="part0030_split_015.html#ch_15_en_22" id="ch_15_een_22"><sup class="calibre7">22</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>He was heartened as well by a personal triumph. Over the objections of even such friends as Silas Deane, he was able to get Temple appointed as the secretary to the new delegation. The honor of his new appointment, and the rejection of his resignation, rejuvenated him. “I call this continuance an honor,” he wrote a friend, “and I really esteem it to be greater than my first appointment, when I consider that all the interest of my enemies…were not sufficient to prevent it.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>He even wrote another friendly letter to Adams, whose own commission to negotiate with Britain had been diluted by the addition of the new delegation. Their mutual appointments, Franklin told Adams, were a great honor, but he wryly lamented that they were likely to be criticized for whatever they accomplished. “I have never known a peace made, even the most advantageous, that was not censured as inadequate,” he said. “‘Blessed are the peacemakers’ is, I suppose, to be understood in the other world, for in this they are frequently cursed.”<a href="part0030_split_015.html#ch_15_en_23" id="ch_15_een_23"><sup class="calibre7">23</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>As a master of the relationship between power and diplomacy, Franklin knew that it would be impossible to win at the negotiating table what was unwinnable on the battlefield. He had been able to negotiate an alliance with France only after America had won the Battle of Saratoga in 1777; he would be able to negotiate a suitable peace with Britain only after America and its French allies won an even more decisive victory.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>That problem was solved in October 1781. The British general Lord Cornwallis had marched north from Charleston, seeking to engage General Washington’s forces, and had taken his stand at Yorktown, Virginia. France’s support proved critical: Lafayette moved to Cornwallis’s southern flank to prevent a retreat, a French fleet arrived at the mouth of the Chesapeake to preclude an escape by sea, French artillery arrived from Rhode Island, and nine thousand French soldiers joined eleven thousand Americans under General Washington’s command. Two four-hundred-man columns, one French and the other American, began the allied assault and bombardment, which continued day and night with such intensity that when Cornwallis sent out a drummer on October 17 to signal his willingness to surrender, it took a while for him to get noticed. It had been four years since the battle of Saratoga, six and a half since Lexington and Concord. On November 19, word of the allied triumph at Yorktown reached Vergennes, who sent a note to Franklin that he reprinted on his press at Passy and distributed the following dawn.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Although the war seemed effectively over, Franklin was cautious. Until the present ministry resigned, there was always the chance that Britain would renew the struggle. “I remember that, when I was a boxing boy, it was allowed, even after an adversary said he had enough, to give him a rising blow,” he wrote Robert Morris, the American finance minister. “Let ours be a douser.”<a href="part0030_split_015.html#ch_15_en_24" id="ch_15_een_24"><sup class="calibre7">24</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Lord North’s government finally collapsed in March 1782, replaced by one headed by Lord Rockingham. Peace talks between America and Britain could now begin. Franklin, it so happened, was the only one of the five American commissioners who was then in Paris. So, for the next few months, until Jay and then Adams finally arrived, he would handle the negotiations on his own. In doing so, he would face two complicating factors:</span></p>
<ul class="calibre9">
<li class="calibre8">America had pledged to coordinate its diplomacy with France and her allies, rather than negotiate with London separately. But the British wanted direct talks leading to a separate peace with America. Franklin, on the surface, would initially insist on acting in concert with the French. But behind the scenes, he would arrange for private and direct peace negotiations with the British.</li>
<li class="calibre8">The Rockingham government had two rival ministers, Foreign Secretary Charles Fox and Colonial Secretary Lord Shelburne, each of whom sent their own negotiators to Paris. Franklin would maneuver to ensure that Shelburne’s envoy, whom he liked better and found more malleable, was given a commission to negotiate with the Americans.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="chapterHeadA">The Negotiations Begin</h3>
<p class="para"><span>“Great affairs sometimes take their rise from small circumstances,” Franklin recorded in the journal he began of the 1782 peace negotiations. In this case, it was a chance meeting between his old flame Madame Brillon and an Englishman named Lord Cholmondeley, who was a friend of Shelburne. Madame Brillon sent Cholmondeley to call on Franklin in Passy, and through him Franklin sent his regards to the new colonial secretary. Franklin had known and liked Shelburne since at least 1766, when he lobbied him about getting a western land grant and made occasional visits to his grand country manor in Wiltshire. Madame Helvétius also played a small role; Shelburne had just sent her some gooseberry bushes, and Franklin wrote politely that they had arrived “in excellent order.”<a href="part0030_split_015.html#ch_15_en_25" id="ch_15_een_25"><sup class="calibre7">25</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Shelburne responded by dispatching Richard Oswald, a retired one-eyed London merchant and former slave trader who had once lived in America, to begin negotiating with Franklin. Oswald arrived on April 15 and immediately tried to convince Franklin that America could get a quicker and better deal if it negotiated independently of the French. Franklin was not yet willing. “I let him know,” he wrote, “that America would not treat but in concert with France.” Instead, he took Oswald to Versailles the next day to meet with Vergennes, who proposed to host a general peace conference of all the warring parties in Paris.<a href="part0030_split_015.html#ch_15_en_26" id="ch_15_een_26"><sup class="calibre7">26</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>On the way back from Versailles, Oswald argued again for a separate peace. Once the issue of American independence was settled by negotiations, he said, it should not be held up while matters relating only to France and Spain (including the ownership of Gibraltar) were still being disputed. He added an implicit threat: if France became involved and made too many demands, England would continue the war and finance it by stopping payment on its public debt.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>The issue of independence, Franklin pointedly replied, had already been settled back in 1776. Britain should simply acknowledge it, rather than offer to negotiate it. As for reneging on their debt in order to renew the war, Franklin made no reply. “I did not desire to discourage their stopping payment, which I considered as cutting the throat of their public credit,” he wrote in his journal. “Such menaces were besides an encouragement with me, remembering the old adage that <span class="italic"><span>they who threaten are afraid.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Instead, Franklin suggested that Britain consider offering reparations to America, especially to “those who had suffered by the scalping and burning parties” that England had enlisted the Indians to wage. “Nothing could have a greater tendency to conciliate,” he said, and that would lead to the renewal of commerce that Britain both needed and desired.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>He even suggested a specific reparations proposal: Britain should offer to cede control of Canada. The money Britain could make from the Canadian fur trade, after all, was tiny compared to what it would save by not having to defend Canada. It was also far less than Britain could make through the renewed commerce with America that would flow from a friendly settlement. In addition, the money that America made from selling open land in Canada could be used to compensate the patriots whose homes had been destroyed by British troops and also the British loyalists whose estates had been confiscated by the Americans.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Behind France’s back, Franklin was playing a wily balance-of-power game. He knew that France, despite her enmity toward Britain, did not want it to cede control of Canada to America. That would make America’s borders more secure, reduce its tensions with Britain, and lessen its need for a friendship with France. If England continued to hold Canada, Franklin explained to Oswald, it “would necessarily oblige us to cultivate and strengthen our union with France.” In his report to Vergennes about his conversation with Oswald, Franklin did not mention that he had suggested the ceding of Canada. It was the first small indication that Franklin, despite his insistence that he would work hand in glove with the French, would be willing to act unilaterally when warranted.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>As usual, Franklin was speaking from notes he had prepared, and Oswald “begged” to be trusted with them so he could show them to Shelburne. After some hesitation, Franklin agreed. Oswald was charmed by Franklin’s trust, and Franklin found Oswald to be sensible and devoid of guile. “We parted exceeding good friends,” he noted.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin had one regret about the paper he entrusted to Oswald: its hint that compensation might be due to the British loyalists in America whose property had been confiscated. So he published on his Passy press, and sent to Adams and others, a fake issue of a Boston newspaper that purported to describe, in gruesome detail, the horrors that the British had perpetrated on innocent Americans. His goal was to emphasize that no sympathy was due the British loyalists, and that it was the Americans who deserved compensation. The fake edition was cleverly convincing. It featured a description of a shipment of American scalps purportedly sent by the Seneca Indians to England and a letter that he pretended was from John Paul Jones. To make it more realistic, he even included fake little ads about a new brick house for sale in south Boston and a missing bay mare in Salem.<a href="part0030_split_015.html#ch_15_en_27" id="ch_15_een_27"><sup class="calibre7">27</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Britain agreed to Vergennes’s proposal for an all-parties peace conference, but that meant sending a new envoy, one who represented the foreign secretary Charles Fox rather than the colonial secretary Shelburne. The new envoy’s name was not auspicious: Thomas Grenville, the son of the despised George Grenville who had imposed the Stamp Act back in 1765. But Fox, who had long been sympathetic to the American side, assured Franklin that the young Grenville, a mere 27, was to be trusted. “I know your liberality of mind too well to be afraid that any prejudices against Mr. Grenville’s <span class="italic"><span>name</span></span> may prevent you from esteeming those excellent qualities of heart and head which belong to him, or from giving the fullest credit to the sincerity of his wishes for peace.”<a href="part0030_split_015.html#ch_15_en_28" id="ch_15_een_28"><sup class="calibre7">28</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>When Grenville arrived in early May, Franklin immediately took him to Versailles, where the young Englishman made the mistake of suggesting to Vergennes that if “England gave America independence,” France should give back some of the Caribbean islands it had conquered and a peace could be quickly settled.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>With the hint of a smile, Vergennes turned on the novice English diplomat and belittled his offer of independence. “America,” he said, “did not ask it of you. There is Mr. Franklin. He will answer you as to that point.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>“To be sure,” said Franklin, “we do not consider ourselves as under any necessity of bargaining for such a thing that is our own and which we have bought at the expense of much blood and treasure.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Like Oswald, Grenville hoped to be able to convince Franklin to negotiate a separate peace with Britain rather than remain linked to France’s demands as well. To that end, he visited Passy a few days later and warned that France “might insist on” provisions that were not related to the treaty she had made with America. If that happened, America should not feel obligated by that treaty to “continue the war to obtain such points for her.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>As he had done with Oswald, Franklin refused to make such a concession. “I gave a little more of my sentiments on the general subject of benefits, obligations and gratitude,” Franklin noted. People who wanted to get out of obligations often “became ingenious in finding out reasons and arguments” to do so, but America would not follow that route. Even if a person borrows money from another and then repays it, he still owes gratitude:“He has discharged the money debt, but the obligation remains.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>This was stretching the idea of gratitude rather far, replied Grenville, for France was the party that actually benefited from America’s separation from Britain. Franklin insisted that he felt so strongly about the “generous and noble manner” in which France had supported America that “I could never suffer myself to think of such reasonings for lessening the obligations.”<a href="part0030_split_015.html#ch_15_en_29" id="ch_15_een_29"><sup class="calibre7">29</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Grenville further annoyed Franklin by trying to hide the fact that his commission gave him the authority to negotiate only with France and not directly with the United States, which Britain did not yet recognize as an independent country. Franklin confronted him on this point at the beginning of June. Why did his commission not explicitly authorize him, Franklin asked, to deal directly with the United States? As Franklin reported to Adams the next day, “He could not explain this to my satisfaction, but said he believed the omission was occasioned by their copying an old commission.” That, of course, did not convince Franklin. He insisted that Grenville get a new commission before any negotiation could begin. This was not merely a nicety of protocol, as Franklin well knew. He was insisting that the British tacitly accept America’s independence as a precondition for talks. “I imagine there is a reluctance in their King to take this first step,” he wrote Adams, “as the giving such a commission would itself be a kind of acknowledgment of our independence.”<a href="part0030_split_015.html#ch_15_en_30" id="ch_15_een_30"><sup class="calibre7">30</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin was willing to work in concert with France, but he had nointention of allowing Britain to insist that France negotiate on America’s behalf. Vergennes agreed. “They want to treat with us for you. But this the King [of France] will not agree to. He thinks it not consistent with the dignity of your state. You will treat for yourselves.” All that was necessary, Vergennes added, was “that the treaties go hand in hand and are signed the same day.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Wittingly or not, Vergennes had given Franklin tacit permission to begin separate discussions with the British. Because the British were very eager to have such talks, and because there were two British negotiators vying to conduct them, Franklin had a lot of leverage. When Grenville returned to Passy at the beginning of June to argue once again for direct talks, this time Franklin decided “to evade the discussion” rather than reject the idea.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>“If Spain and Holland and even if France should insist on unreasonable terms,” Grenville asked, “can it be right that America should be dragged on in a war for their interests only?”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>It was “unnecessary to enter at present into considerations of that kind,” Franklin replied. “If any of the other powers should make extravagant demands,” he continued enticingly, “it would then be time enough to consider what our obligations were.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Because Grenville was so eager to get direct talks underway, he was willing to tell Franklin, confidentially, that he was “instructed to acknowledge the independence of America previous to the commencement of the treaty.” Oswald was also eager for direct talks to begin, and he came to Passy two days later to hint that he would be willing to serve as Britain’s negotiator if Franklin preferred. He was coy. He was not trying to supplant Grenville, he insisted, for he was old and had no need for further glory. But it was clear to Franklin that he was now in the happy position of having a choice between two hungry suitors.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Oswald was more sophisticated than Grenville, and he was able to appear both more eager and more threatening. Peace was “absolutely necessary” for Britain, he confided. “Our enemies may now do what they please with us; they have the ball at their foot.” On the other hand, there were those back in London who were “a little too much elated” by Britain’s recent victory over the French navy in a major battle in the West Indies. If he and Franklin did not act soon, they might prevail in prolonging the war. There had even been serious discussions, Oswald warned, of ways to finance further fighting by canceling debt payment only on bonds of more than £1,000, which would not upset most of the population.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin noted that he viewed this “as a kind of intimidation.” Yet Oswald was able to soften Franklin through flattery. “He repeatedly mentioned the great esteem the ministers had for me,” Franklin recorded. “They depended on me for the means of extricating the nation from its present desperate situation; that perhaps no single man had ever in his hands an opportunity of doing so much good as I had at present.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Oswald further endeared himself to Franklin by seeming to agree with him privately on what should be in a treaty. When Franklin railed against the idea of paying compensation to loyalists whose estates had been confiscated, saying that such a demand would elicit a contrary one from America demanding reparations for all the towns the British had burned, Oswald confidentially said that he personally felt the same. He also said that he agreed with Franklin that Britain should cede Canada to America. It was as if he were competing with young Grenville in an audition for the job of being Britain’s negotiator and trying to win Franklin’s recommendation.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Indeed, oddly enough, he was. He showed Franklin a memo that Shelburne had written that offered to give Oswald, if Franklin wished it, a commission to be the special negotiator with America. Shelburne wrote that he was willing to give Oswald any authority “which Dr. Franklin and he may judge conducive to a final settlement of things between Great Britain and America.” That way, Shelburne’s memo added, Britain could forge a peace with America “in a very different manner from the peace between Great Britain and France, who have always been at enmity with each other.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Oswald coyly noted that Grenville was “a very sensible young gentleman,” and he was perfectly willing to leave it to him to conduct the negotiations in concert with France. However, if Franklin thought it would be “useful” to have Oswald deal directly with the Americans, he was “content to give his time and service.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin was happy to accept. Oswald’s “knowledge of America,” he noted, meant that he would be better than Grenville “in persuading the ministry to things reasonable.” Franklin asked Oswald whether he would prefer to negotiate with all the countries, including France, or to negotiate with America alone. Oswald’s answer, obviously, was the latter. “He said he did not choose to be concerned in treating with the foreign powers,” Franklin noted. “If he accepted any commission, it should be that of treating with America.” Franklin agreed to write Shelburne secretly recommending that course.<a href="part0030_split_015.html#ch_15_en_31" id="ch_15_een_31"><sup class="calibre7">31</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Partly, Franklin was motivated by his affection for Oswald, who was his age, and his lack of affection for the younger Grenville, who had annoyed Franklin by leaking to the London <span class="italic"><span>Evening Post</span></span> an inaccurate account of one of their meetings. “Mr. Oswald, an old man, seems now to have no desire but that of being useful in doing good,” Franklin noted. “Mr. Grenville, a young man, naturally desirous of acquiring a reputation, seems to aim at that of being an able negotiator.” Franklin, though still ambitious at 76, now believed in the moderating effects of old age.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Although Franklin had made a great show of insisting that the French be involved in all negotiations, he had come to believe that it was now in America’s interest to have its own separate and private channel with Britain. So, when he went to Versailles in mid-June, a week after his momentous meeting with Oswald, he was less candid than usual with Vergennes. “We spoke of all [Britain’s] attempts to separate us, and the prudence of holding together and treating in concert,” he recorded. This time, however, he held back some information. He did not detail Oswald’s offer to have a private negotiating channel or his suggestion that Britain cede Canada to America.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Nor was Franklin fully candid with the Congress, which had instructed its peace commissioners, with Franklin’s approval, not to do anything without France’s full knowledge and support. In a letter in late June to Robert Livingston, the new American foreign secretary, Franklin reported that Britain had sent over two envoys, Oswald and Grenville, and he claimed that he had rejected their attempts to split America from France. “They had at first some hopes of getting the belligerent powers to treat separately, one after another, but finding that impracticable, they have, after several messages sent to and fro, come to a resolution of treating with all together for a general peace.” The very next day, however, he reiterated his desire for a separate channel in a letter he wrote for Oswald to give to Shelburne: “I cannot but hope that it is still intended to vest you with [authority] respecting the treaty with America.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Britain was likewise engaging in back-channel intrigue. In addition to holding informal discussions with the French, it sent envoys directly to the Congress trying to urge members to accept some form of dominion status for America that would permit separate parliaments loyal to a common king. When Franklin heard of these overtures, he wrote another letter to Livingston warning that they must be forcefully resisted. “The King hates us most cordially,” he declared. If he were allowed “any degree of power or government” over America, “it will soon be extended by corruption, artifice, and force, until we are reduced to absolute subjection.”<a href="part0030_split_015.html#ch_15_en_32" id="ch_15_een_32"><sup class="calibre7">32</sup></a></span></p>
<h3 class="chapterHeadA">Franklin’s Peace Plan</h3>
<p class="para"><span>At the beginning of July, the negotiating situation was simplified by the death of Lord Rockingham. Shelburne took over as prime minister, Fox resigned as foreign secretary, and Grenville was recalled. The time was right for Franklin to make an informal, but precise, peace offer to Oswald, which he did on July 10.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>His proposal was divided into two parts, “necessary” provisions and “advisable” ones. Four fell into the former category: independence for America that was “full and complete in every sense,” the removal of all British troops, secure boundaries, and fishing rights off the Canadian coast. In the advisable category were four suggested provisions: payment of reparations for the destruction in America, an acknowledgment of British guilt, a free trade agreement, and the ceding of Canada to the United States.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Oswald immediately sent Shelburne all the details, but Franklin kept the proposals private and never recorded them. Nor did he consult with, or even inform, Vergennes about the offer he had made to Oswald.<a href="part0030_split_015.html#ch_15_en_33" id="ch_15_een_33"><sup class="calibre7">33</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Thus, with clear vision and a bit of conniving, Franklin had set the stage for the final negotiations that would end the Revolutionary War. Shelburne promptly informed Oswald that the suggestions were “un-equivocal proofs of Dr. Franklin’s sincerity.” Britain was willing, he said, to affirm America’s independence as a preliminary to negotiations, and it should “be done decidedly so as to avoid future risks of enmity.” If America would drop the “advisable” provisions, Shelburne said, and “those called necessary alone retained as the ground of discussion,” then he was confident that a treaty could be “speedily concluded.” Although it would take a few more months, that is in essence what happened.<a href="part0030_split_015.html#ch_15_en_34" id="ch_15_een_34"><sup class="calibre7">34</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>The final resolution was delayed, however, when Franklin was struck by “cruel gout” and kidney stones, which incapacitated him for much of August and September. John Jay, who had finally arrived in Paris, took over as the lead negotiator. The flinty New Yorker objected that the wording of Oswald’s commission, which authorized him to negotiate “with the said colonies and plantations,” was not much better than Grenville’s had been, and he demanded that Oswald get a clear statement that he was dealing with an independent nation before talks proceeded further.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>When Jay and Franklin went to call on Vergennes, the French minister advised that it did not seem necessary to insist that Oswald’s commission contain a clear declaration of America’s sovereignty. Franklin, who likewise gave his opinion that Oswald’s commission “would do,” was thrilled by Vergennes’s tacit approval for the British-American negotiations to proceed, which he interpreted as a magnanimous and supportive gesture showing France’s “gracious goodwill.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Jay’s interpretation, more sinister but more correct, was that Vergennes did not want Britain to recognize American independence except as part of a comprehensive peace settlement involving France and Spain. “This Court chooses to postpone an acknowledgment of our independence by Britain,” Jay reported to the Congress, “in order to keep us under their direction” until all the demands of France and Spain were met. “I ought to add that Dr. Franklin does not see the conduct of this Court in the light I do.”<a href="part0030_split_015.html#ch_15_en_35" id="ch_15_een_35"><sup class="calibre7">35</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Jay’s skepticism about France’s motives led to a heated argument with Franklin when they returned to Passy from Versailles that evening. Jay was especially angry, he told Franklin, that Vergennes had brought up Spain’s desire to claim some of the land between the Allegheny Mountains and the Mississippi River. Franklin fully agreed that Spain should not be permitted to “coop us up,” but he gave Jay one of his gentle lectures about the wisdom of assuming that a friend like France was acting in good faith until there was hard evidence to the contrary. France was not trying to hold up negotiations, as Jay kept angrily insisting; instead, Franklin argued, Vergennes had shown a willingness to speed them along by not objecting to the wording of Oswald’s commission.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>But Jay’s suspicions were reinforced when he learned that Vergennes had sent a deputy on a secret mission to London. Trusting neither the French nor Franklin, Jay joined in the back-channel fandango by dispatching a secret envoy of his own to London. What made this especially intriguing was that the man he sent was Benjamin Vaughan, Franklin’s longtime friend and publisher, who had come to Paris to visit Franklin and do what he could to promote peace.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Jay asked Vaughan to tell Lord Shelburne that Oswald’s commission needed to state unambiguously that he was to negotiate with “the United States.” Such an explicit acknowledgment of American independence at the outset, Jay promised, would help “cut the cords” that bound America to France. Shelburne, eager to conclude a peace before his government toppled, was willing to go far enough to satisfy Jay. In mid-September his cabinet granted Oswald a new commission “to treat with the commissioners appointed by the colonies under the title of 13 united states,” and it reaffirmed that American independence could be acknowledged as a preliminary to further discussions.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>So, on October 5, with Jay and Franklin both satisfied and back in harmony, official negotiations began. Oswald presented his formal new commission, and Jay presented a proposed treaty that was very similar to the one Franklin had informally offered in July. The only addition to Franklin’s four “necessary” points was a provision that was sure to please Britain, though not France or Spain: that both Britain and America would have free navigation rights on the Mississippi.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Their momentum, however, was slowed for a few weeks after Britain succeeded in beating back a French-Spanish attack on Gibraltar, thus emboldening their ministers. To stiffen Oswald’s backbone, Shelburne sent over Henry Strachey, a cabinet officer who had served as Admiral Howe’s secretary. Just as he arrived, so did John Adams, yet again, to assume his role as a member of the American delegation.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Adams was as blunt as ever, filled with suspicions and doubting everyone’s character but his own. Even Lafayette, who had become Franklin’s close confidant, was immediately slammed by Adams as a “mongrel character” of “unlimited ambition” who was “panting for glory.” Adams also displayed, in a public and undiplomatic way, his personal distrust of Vergennes by not calling on him for almost three weeks, until the minister “caused him to be reminded of” his duty to do so. (Vergennes, who was as smooth as Adams was rough, baffled the wary Adams by laying on a lavish dinner and plying him with fine wines and Madeira.)<a href="part0030_split_015.html#ch_15_en_36" id="ch_15_een_36"><sup class="calibre7">36</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Adams likewise initially balked at paying a courtesy call on Franklin, who was pretty much confined to Passy with the gout and kidney stones, even though they had managed to exchange civil letters during Adams’s mission in Holland. “He could not bear to go near him,” Matthew Ridley, an American merchant in Paris, recorded in his diary. Ridley, who was a friend of both men, finally convinced Adams that it was necessary.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Adams felt particularly spiteful because he had recently learned about the letter Franklin had written to the Congress, at the behest of Vergennes, which had led to his earlier recall. Franklin had been motivated by “base jealousy” and “sordid envy,” Adams told a friend. That was a complete misreading of Franklin, who had acted more out of annoyance than jealousy and whose occasional vices did not include an excess of envy.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Whatever the cause, Adams was filled with anger by the time he arrived back in Paris. “That I have no friendship for Franklin I avow,” he wrote. “That I am incapable of having any with a man of his moral sentiments I avow.” In his diary, Adams had even more to say: “Franklin’s cunning will be to divide us. To this end he will provoke, he will insinuate, he will intrigue, he will maneuver.”<a href="part0030_split_015.html#ch_15_en_37" id="ch_15_een_37"><sup class="calibre7">37</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>So it was a great testament to Franklin’s charm that, as it turned out, he got along rather well with Adams once they settled down to work. When Adams bluntly told him, during the visit he finally made to Passy, that he agreed with Jay’s tougher attitude toward France, “the Doctor heard me patiently, but said nothing.” And at a meeting of the three commissioners the next day, Franklin serenely agreed with Adams and Jay that it made sense to meet with the British negotiators without coordinating with the French. Turning to Jay he said, “I am of your opinion and will go on with these gentlemen in the business without consulting this [France’s] Court.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin’s willingness to negotiate without consulting France was not new; he had begun pursuing that approach before Jay and Adams arrived in Paris. But he made it seem that he was doing it partly in deference to the views of his two fellow commissioners, which served to soften Adams’s attitude. Franklin “has gone on with us in entire harmony and unanimity,” Adams happily recorded in his diary, “and has been able and useful, both by his sagacity and his reputation, in the whole negotiation.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>For his part, Franklin continued to feel the same mixture of admiration and annoyance toward Adams that he had long held. As he would put it to Livingston a few months later, once the negotiations were over, “He means well for his country, is always an honest man, often a wise one, but sometimes and in some things, absolutely out of his senses.”<a href="part0030_split_015.html#ch_15_en_38" id="ch_15_een_38"><sup class="calibre7">38</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>On October 30, Adams’s forty-seventh birthday, the American negotiators and their British counterparts launched an intense week of negotiations, which started at eleven each morning and continued through late suppers most evenings. The British readily accepted the four “necessary points” that Franklin had proposed back in July, but not the “advisable points,” such as the ceding of Canada. The main disputes they faced that week were:</span></p>
<ul class="calibre9">
<li class="calibre8">Fishing rights off Newfoundland: This was a major issue for Adams, who, as David McCullough points out, was eloquent in his sermons on “New England’s ancient stake in the sacred codfish.” Franklin was likewise firm on the point, and he provided an economic argument: the money that Americans made from fishing would be spent on British manufactures once friendship was restored. “Are you afraid there is not fish enough,” he asked, “or that we should catch too many?” The British conceded the point, to the dismay of France, which was hoping to win special fishing rights of its own. (When Franklin was accused by his enemies in America of favoring the French position and opposing a demand for American fishing rights, he wrote Jay and Adams asking them to attest to his firmness; Jay graciously complied, and Adams did so more grudgingly.)<a href="part0030_split_015.html#ch_15_en_39" id="ch_15_een_39"><sup class="calibre7">39</sup></a></li>
<li class="calibre8">Prewar debts still owed by Americans to British merchants: Franklin and Jay felt they should be renounced, because Britain had taken or destroyed so much American property. Adams, however, insisted that such debts be honored, and his view prevailed.</li>
<li class="calibre8">The western boundary: With his lifelong vision of American expansion, Franklin insisted that no other nation should have rights to the land between the Alleghenies and the Mississippi. As Jay recorded, “He has invariably declared it to be his opinion that we should insist on the Mississippi as our Western boundary.” Again, this is not something that France or Spain would have supported at a general peace conference. But Britain was happy to accept the river as the western boundary along with free navigation rights for both nations.</li>
<li class="calibre8">Compensation for the British loyalists in America whose estates had been confiscated: This was the most contentious issue, and Franklin made it even more so. He justified his implacable stance on moral grounds. The loyalists had helped cause the war, and their losses were far less than those suffered by American patriots whose property had been destroyed by the British. But his stubbornness also had a personal component. Among the most visible loyalists were his former friend Joseph Galloway and, more notably, his estranged son, William. Franklin’s anger toward his son, and his desire to prove it publicly, had a major impact on his attitude toward the loyalist claims, and it added a painful personal poignancy to the final weeks of negotiations.</li>
</ul>
<p class="para"><span>William, who had been released from his Connecticut captivity through a prisoner exchange in September 1778, had been living in British-occupied New York, where he served as the president of the Board of Associated Loyalists. In that capacity, he had encouraged a series of small but brutal raids on American forces. One of these resulted in the lynching murder of an American captain, and General Washington had responded by threatening to hang one of his British prisoners, a young and very well-connected officer named Charles Asgill, if the perpetrators were not brought to justice.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Asgill’s friends and family used their great influence to try to save his life, and Shelburne sent a personal appeal to Franklin to intercede. Franklin sharply refused. Washington’s aim was “to obtain the punishment of a deliberate murderer,” he replied. “If the English refuse to deliver up or punish this murderer, it is saying that they choose to preserve him rather than Captain Asgill. It seems to me therefore that the application should be made to the English ministers.”<a href="part0030_split_015.html#ch_15_en_40" id="ch_15_een_40"><sup class="calibre7">40</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>The issue became more personal for Franklin when a British court-martial acquitted the accused British soldier on the grounds that he was merely following orders. That prompted outraged Americans to demand the arrest of the person who had issued those orders: William Franklin. So, in August 1782, twenty years after his arrival in America as New Jersey governor, William prudently fled back to London, where he arrived in late September, just as his father’s final round of peace negotiations with Oswald were beginning.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>The meddlesome Vaughan further complicated matters by urging Shelburne to be solicitous toward William. He informed the prime minister that Temple Franklin had, when Vaughan discussed it with him in Passy, “intimated hopes to see something done for his father,” and Vaughan later added his own belief, very mistaken, that doing so would have a “seasonable effect” on Benjamin Franklin’s disposition toward Britain. So Shelburne met with William and promised to do all he could to help both him and the loyalists. Franklin was chagrined when he learned of all this, and was especially angry when he discovered that Vaughan’s misguided interference had come at the behest of young Temple, who had interceded on his father’s behalf without telling his grandfather.<a href="part0030_split_015.html#ch_15_en_41" id="ch_15_een_41"><sup class="calibre7">41</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin expressed his sentiments, as he often did, in a short fable. There was once, he wrote, a great lion, king of the forest, who “had among his subjects a body of faithful dogs.” But the lion king, “influenced by evil counselors,” went to war with them. “A few of them, of a mongrel race, derived from a mixture of wolves and foxes, corrupted by royal promises of great rewards, deserted the honest dogs and joined their enemies.” When the dogs won their freedom, the wolves and foxes of the king’s council gathered to argue for compensation to the mongrels who had remained loyal. But a horse arose, “with a boldness and freedom that became the nobleness of his nature,” and argued that any reward for fratricide was unjust and would lead only to further wars. “The council had sense enough,” Franklin concluded, “to resolve that the demand be rejected.”<a href="part0030_split_015.html#ch_15_en_42" id="ch_15_een_42"><sup class="calibre7">42</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>In the final days of the negotiations, Franklin became even more obdurate against any compensation for the loyalists, even as Adams and Jay showed some willingness to compromise on the issue. In the past, Adams had accused Franklin of being untrustworthy because of his supposed sympathy toward his loyalist son. Now he was baffled that Franklin was being so belligerent in the other direction. “Dr. Franklin is very staunch against the Tories,” he noted in his diary, “more decided on this point than Mr. Jay or myself.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Given the influence of the loyalist emigrants now living in Britain, Shelburne knew that his ministry might fall if he did nothing to satisfy their claims. His negotiators pushed until the very last day, but Franklin threatened to scuttle the entire treaty over this point. He pulled from his pocket a paper that resurrected his own demand that Britain, if it wanted any recompense for the loyalists’ estates, must pay for all of the American towns destroyed, goods taken, cargo captured, villages burned, and even his own looted library in Philadelphia.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>The British were forced to relent. After hearing Franklin’s diatribe, they retired to an adjacent room, huddled, and returned to say they would accept instead a somewhat meaningless promise that the Congress would “earnestly recommend” to the individual states that they make whatever restitution each of them saw fit for the loyalists’ estates confiscated there. The Americans knew that the states would end up doing little, so they agreed, but Franklin still insisted on one caveat, aimed at William: the recommendation would not apply to loyalists who had “borne arms against the said United States.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>The next morning, November 30, 1782, the American negotiators, along with their secretary, Temple Franklin, met with the British in Oswald’s suite at the Grand Hotel Muscovite to sign the provisional treaty that, in effect, ended the Revolutionary War. In a nod to the obligations owed France, the pact would not become formally binding “until terms of a peace shall be agreed upon between Great Britain and France.” That would take another nine months. But the treaty had an immediate and irrevocable import that was contained in its opening line, which declared the United States “to be free, sovereign and independent.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>That afternoon, the American negotiators all went to Passy, where Franklin hosted a celebratory dinner. Even John Adams was feeling mellower, at least for the time being. He conceded to his friend Matthew Ridley that Franklin had “behaved well and nobly.”<a href="part0030_split_015.html#ch_15_en_43" id="ch_15_een_43"><sup class="calibre7">43</sup></a></span></p>
<h3 class="chapterHeadA">Placating the French</h3>
<p class="para"><span>To Franklin fell the difficult duty of explaining to Vergennes why the Americans had breached their obligations to France, and their instructions from the Congress, by agreeing to a treaty without consulting him. After sending Vergennes a copy of the signed accord, which he stressed was provisional, Franklin called on him at Versailles the following week. The French minister remarked, coolly but politely, that “proceeding in this abrupt signature of the articles” was not “agreeable to the [French] King” and that the Americans “had not been particularly civil.” Nevertheless, Vergennes did allow that the Americans had done well by themselves, and he noted that “our conversation was amicable.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Only when Franklin followed up with a brash request for yet another French loan, along with the information that he was transmitting the peace accord to the Congress, did Vergennes take the opportunity to protest officially. It was lacking in propriety, he wrote Franklin, for him “to hold out a certain hope of peace to America without even informing yourself on the state of negotiation on our part.” America was under an obligation not to consider ratifying any peace until France had also come to terms with Britain. “You have all your life performed your duties,” Vergennes continued. “I pray you to consider how you propose to fulfill those which are due to the King.”<a href="part0030_split_015.html#ch_15_en_44" id="ch_15_een_44"><sup class="calibre7">44</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin’s response, which has been called “a diplomatic masterpiece” and “one of the most famous of all diplomatic letters,” combined a few dignified expressions of contrition with appeals to France’s national interest. “Nothing has been agreed in the preliminaries contrary to the interests of France,” he noted, not entirely correctly, “and no peace is to take place between us and England until you have concluded yours.” Using a French word that roughly translates as “propriety,” Franklin sought to minimize the American transgression:</span></p>
<div class="extract">
<p class="extractText"><span>In not consulting you before they were signed, we have been guilty of neglecting a point of <span class="italic"><span>bienséance.</span></span> But, as this was not from want of respect for the King, whom we all love and honor, we hope it will be excused, and that the great work, which has hitherto been so happily conducted, is so nearly brought to perfection, and is so glorious to his reign, will not be ruined by a single indiscretion of ours.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="para"><span>He went on, undaunted, to press his case for another loan. “Certainly the whole edifice sinks to the ground immediately if you refuse on that account to give us any further assistance.” With that came both a plea and an implied threat: making a public issue of the transgression, he warned, could hurt the mutual interests of both countries. “The English, I just now learn, flatter themselves they have already divided us. I hope this little misunderstanding will therefore be kept a secret, and that they will find themselves totally mistaken.”<a href="part0030_split_015.html#ch_15_en_45" id="ch_15_een_45"><sup class="calibre7">45</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Vergennes was stunned by Franklin’s letter, a copy of which he sent to his ambassador in Philadelphia. “You may imagine my astonishment,” he wrote. “I think it proper that the most influential members of Congress should be informed of the very irregular conduct of their commissioners in regard to us.” He did not blame Franklin personally, except to say that “he has yielded too easily to the bias of his colleagues.” Vergennes went on to lament, correctly, that the new nation was not one that would enter into entangling alliances. “We shall be but poorly paid for all that we have done for the United States,” he complained, “and for securing to them a national existence.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>There was little Vergennes could do. Forcing a showdown, as Franklin had subtly warned, would drive the Americans into an even faster and closer alliance with Britain. So, reluctantly, he let the matter drop, instructed his envoy not to file an official protest with the Congress, and even agreed to supply yet another French loan.<a href="part0030_split_015.html#ch_15_en_46" id="ch_15_een_46"><sup class="calibre7">46</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>“Two great diplomatic duelists had formally crossed swords,” Carl Van Doren noted, “and the philosopher had exquisitely disarmed the minister.” Yes, but perhaps a better analogy would be to Franklin’s own favorite game of chess. From his opening gambit that led to America’s treaty of alliance with France to the endgame that produced a peace with England while preserving French friendship, Franklin mastered a three-dimensional game against two aggressive players by exhibiting great patience when the pieces were not properly aligned and carefully exploiting strategic advantages when they were.<a href="part0030_split_015.html#ch_15_en_47" id="ch_15_een_47"><sup class="calibre7">47</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin had been instrumental in shaping the three great documents of the war: the Declaration of Independence, the alliance with France, and the treaty with England. Now he turned his thoughts to peace. “All wars are follies, very expensive, and very mischievous ones,” he wrote Polly Stevenson. “When will mankind be convinced of this, and agree to settle their differences by arbitration? Were they to do it, even by the cast of a die, it would be better than by fighting and destroying each other.” To Joseph Banks, one of the many old friends from England he wrote in celebration, he asserted yet again his famous, albeit somewhat misleading, credo: “There never was a good war or a bad peace.”<a href="part0030_split_015.html#ch_15_en_48" id="ch_15_een_48"><sup class="calibre7">48</sup></a></span></p>
<h3 class="chapterHeadA">Benny and Temple</h3>
<p class="para"><span>Rather than return home immediately, Franklin decided to relish his newly earned peace and leisure by enjoying the friends, family, and intellectual pursuits available to him in the idyllic setting of Passy. His grandson Benny had been languishing at his school in Geneva, which had recently been thrown into political turmoil over plans to give full voting rights to all citizens. Now that his diplomatic duties had subsided, Franklin decided to permit Benny to come back to Passy for a vacation during the summer of 1783, his first since leaving four years earlier.<a href="part0030_split_015.html#ch_15_en_49" id="ch_15_een_49"><sup class="calibre7">49</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Reunited at last with the grandfather he was so eager to impress, Benny was completely charmed. Franklin was “very different from other old persons,” he told a visitor, “for they are fretful and complaining and dissatisfied, and my grandpapa is laughing and cheerful like a young person.” Their new proximity also warmed Franklin. Benny was “so well grown,” he wrote the boy’s parents, “and so much improved in his learning and behavior.” To Polly Stevenson he wrote, “He gains every day upon my affections.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>That summer, during which Benny turned 14, his grandfather took him to the Seine for swimming lessons, and his cousin Temple taught him fencing and dancing. Temple also impressed him by pretending to kill a mouse with helium, then reviving him, then killing him for good with an electric spark from one of Franklin’s batteries. “I am sure my cousin would pass for a conjurer in America,” Benny wrote his parents.<a href="part0030_split_015.html#ch_15_en_50" id="ch_15_een_50"><sup class="calibre7">50</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Benny had been sickly and depressed at school, Franklin learned, and the political situation in Geneva remained volatile. So he decided that the boy need not return, even though he had left his clothes and books there. He had earlier considered sending Benny to school in England under the care of Polly Stevenson, who had been excited by the prospect. Now, worried that Benny was losing his command of English, he raised the possibility with Polly more seriously. “Would that still be convenient to you?” he asked. “He is docile and of gentle manners, ready to receive and follow good advice, and will set no bad example to your <span class="italic"><span>other</span></span> children.” Polly was wary but willing. “I fear he will think us so unpolished he will scarcely be able to endure us,” she replied, “but if English cordiality will make amends for French refinement, we may have some chance of making him happy.”<a href="part0030_split_015.html#ch_15_en_51" id="ch_15_een_51"><sup class="calibre7">51</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin, who had grown ever more fond of Benny, instead decided that he should stay in Passy. “He showed such an unwillingness to leave me, and Temple such a fondness for retaining him, that I concluded to keep him,” Franklin explained to Polly in a letter at the end of 1783. “He behaves very well, and we love him very much.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Perhaps, with his felicity in language, Benny could become a diplomat, Franklin thought. That would require, however, getting him a public appointment, something that was proving difficult for Temple. He had once told Richard Bache, just as he had told his son, William, and many others, that it was demeaning to be dependent on a government appointment. Now he expressed the same sentiment to Richard again, this time in a letter about his son Benny: “I have determined to give him a trade that he may have something to depend on, and not be obliged to ask favors or offices of anybody.”<a href="part0030_split_015.html#ch_15_en_52" id="ch_15_een_52"><sup class="calibre7">52</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>The trade Franklin chose was the obvious one. His private little printing press at Passy was busy that autumn turning out editions of his bagatelles, so he was delighted when the boy eagerly started to work there. A master founder was hired to teach him how to cast type, and by spring Franklin had persuaded François Didot, the greatest and most artistic printer in France, to take him on as a student. Benny was destined to follow in Franklin’s footsteps, not only as a printer but also eventually as a newspaper editor.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>As for Temple, Franklin was reduced to asking for favors and offices. As he was enjoying the sweet summer of 1783, he wrote to Foreign Secretary Livingston yet another plaintive plea on poor Temple’s behalf:</span></p>
<div class="extract">
<p class="extractText"><span>He has now gone through an apprenticeship of near seven years in the ministerial business, and is very capable of serving the States in that line, as possessing all the requisites of knowledge, zeal, activity, language, and address…But it is not my custom to solicit employments for myself, or any of my family, and I shall not do it in this case. I only hope, that if he is not to be employed in your new arrangement, I may be informed of it as soon as possible, that, while I have strength left for it, I may accompany him in a tour to Italy, returning through Germany, which I think he may make to more advantage with me than alone, and which I have long promised to afford him, as a reward for his faithful service, and his tender filial attachment to me.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="para"><span>Temple did not get a ministerial posting, nor did his grandfather take him on a grand tour. Instead, he emulated his grandfather (and father) in a less laudable way than Benny. After failing to marry either of the Brillons’ daughters, Temple became involved with a married woman who lived near Passy, Blanchette Caillot, whose husband was a successful actor. With her he fathered an illegitimate son, Theodore. In a cruel irony, the child died from smallpox, the disease that had taken the only legitimate son among three generations of Franklins.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Theodore Franklin, the illegitimate son of the illegitimate son of Franklin’s own illegitimate son, was, albeit briefly, the last male-line descendant of Benjamin Franklin, who would in the end leave no family line bearing his name.<a href="part0030_split_015.html#ch_15_en_53" id="ch_15_een_53"><sup class="calibre7">53</sup></a></span></p>
<h3 class="chapterHeadA">Balloon Mania</h3>
<p class="para"><span>Among the diversions Benny enjoyed with his grandfather in the summer and fall of 1783 were the grand spectacles of the first balloon flights. The age of air travel began in June when two brothers, Joseph and Etienne Montgolfier, launched an unmanned hot-air balloon near Lyons that rose to a height of six thousand feet. The Franklins were not there, but they did witness in late August the first unmanned flight using hydrogen. A scientist named Jacques Charles launched a twelve-foot-diameter silk balloon filled with hydrogen produced by pouring oil of vitriol over fiery iron filings. With great fanfare, it took off from Paris in front of fifty thousand spectators and floated for more than forty-five minutes before landing in a village more than fifteen miles away. “The country people who saw it fall were frightened,” Franklin wrote Sir Joseph Banks, president of the Royal Society, “and attacked it with stones and knives so that it was much mangled.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>The race was then on to produce the first <span class="italic"><span>manned</span></span> flight, and it was won on November 21 by the Montgolfiers with their hot-air model. As a huge crowd cheered and countless women fainted, the balloon took off with two champagne-toting noblemen, who initially found themselves snared by some tree branches. “I was then in great pain for the men, thinking them in danger of being thrown out or burnt,” Franklin reported. But soon they were free and gliding their way over the Seine, and after twenty minutes they landed on the other side and popped their corks in triumph. Franklin was among the distinguished scientists who signed the official certification of the historic flight the following evening, when the Montgolfiers called on him at Passy.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>The Montgolfiers believed that the lift was caused not just by hot air but also by smoke, so they instructed their “aeronauts” to ply the fire with wet straw and wool. Franklin, however, was more partial to Charles’s “inflammable air” model using hydrogen, and he helped to finance the first manned flight in such a balloon. It took place ten days later. As Franklin watched from his carriage parked near the Tuileries Gardens (his gout preventing him from joining the throng on the wet grass), Charles and a partner flew for more than two hours and landed safely twenty-seven miles away. Once again, Franklin provided a report to the Royal Society through Banks: “I had a pocket glass, with which I followed it until I lost sight, first of the men, then of the car, and when I last saw the balloon it appeared no bigger than a walnut.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Ever since the days of his electricity experiments, Franklin believed that science should be pursued initially for pure fascination and curiosity, and then practical uses would eventually flow from what was discovered. At first, he was reluctant to guess what practical use might come of balloons, but he was convinced that experimenting with them would someday, as he told Banks, “pave the way to some discoveries in natural philosophy of which at present we have no conception.” There could be, he noted in another letter, “important consequences that no one can foresee.” More famous was his pithier expression of the same sentiment, made in response to a spectator who asked what use this new balloon thing could be. “What is the use,” he replied, “of a newborn baby?”<a href="part0030_split_015.html#ch_15_en_54" id="ch_15_een_54"><sup class="calibre7">54</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Because the English saw no utility in ballooning and because they were a bit too proud to follow the French, they did not join in the excitement. “I see an inclination in the more respectable part of the Royal Society to guard against the Ballomania [until] some experiment likely to prove beneficial either to society or science is proposed,” Banks wrote. Franklin scoffed at this attitude. “It does not seem to me a good reason to decline prosecuting a new experiment which apparently increases the power of man over matter until we can see to what use that power may be applied,” he replied. “When we have learned to manage it, we may hope some time or other to find uses for it, as men have done for magnetism and electricity, of which the first experiments were mere matters of amusement.” By early the following year, he had come up with one possibility for a practical use: balloons might serve as a way to wage war, or even better, as a way to preserve peace. “Convincing sovereigns of the folly of wars may perhaps be one effect, since it will be impracticable for the most potent of them to guard his dominions,” he wrote to his friend Jan Ingenhousz, the Dutch scientist and physician.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Mainly, however, Franklin contented himself with enjoying the craze and all the entertainments surrounding it. Exhibition flights of fanciful balloons, decorated and gilded in glorious patterns, became the rage in Paris that season, and they even influenced hats and hair-styles, fashions and dances. Temple Franklin and Benny Bache produced their own miniature models. And Franklin wrote one of his typical parodies, which, like many of his early ones, used the anonymous voice of a fictional woman. “If you want to fill your balloons with an element ten times lighter than inflammable air,” she wrote to one of the newspapers, “you can find a great quantity of it, and ready made, in the promises of lovers and of courtiers.”<a href="part0030_split_015.html#ch_15_en_55" id="ch_15_een_55"><sup class="calibre7">55</sup></a></span></p>
<h3 class="chapterHeadA">Eminence Grise</h3>
<p class="para"><span>Even as he indulged in the frivolities of prerevolutionary Paris, Franklin focused much of his writing on his egalitarian, antielitist ideas for building a new American society based on middle-class virtues. His daughter, Sally, sent him newspaper clippings about the formation of a hereditary order of merit called the Society of the Cincinnati, which was headed by General Washington and open to distinguished officers of the American army who would pass the title down to their eldest sons. Franklin, replying at the beginning of 1784, ridiculed the concept. The Chinese were right, he said, to honor the parents of people who earned distinction, for they had some role in it. But honoring a worthy person’s descendants, who had nothing to do with achieving the merit, “is not only groundless and absurd but often hurtful to that posterity.” Any form of hereditary aristocracy or nobility was, he declared, “in direct opposition to the solemnly declared sense of their country.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>He also, in the letter, ridiculed the symbol of the new Cincinnati order, a bald eagle, which had also been selected as a national symbol. That provoked one of Franklin’s most famous riffs about America’s values and the question of a national bird:</span></p>
<div class="extract">
<p class="extractText"><span>I wish the bald eagle had not been chosen as the representative of our country; he is a bird of bad moral character, he does not get his living honestly; you may have seen him perched on some dead tree, near the river where, too lazy to fish for himself, he watches the labors of the fishing-hawk…The turkey is, in comparison, a much more respectable bird, and a true original native of America…He is (though a little vain and silly, it is true, but not the worse emblem for that) a bird of courage, and would not hesitate to attack a grenadier of the British guards.<a href="part0030_split_015.html#ch_15_en_56" id="ch_15_een_56"><sup class="calibre7">56</sup></a></span></p>
</div>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin heard so frequently from people who wanted to emigrate to America that in early 1784 he printed a pamphlet, in French and English, designed to encourage the more industrious of them while discouraging those who sought a life of upper-class leisure. His essay, “Information to Those Who Would Remove to America,” is one of the clearest expressions of his belief that American society should be based on the virtues of the middle (or “mediocre,” as he sometimes called them, meaning it as a word of praise) classes, of which he still considered himself a part.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>There were few people in America either as poor or as rich as those in Europe, he said. “It is rather a general happy mediocrity that prevails.” Instead of rich proprietors and struggling tenants, “most people cultivate their own lands” or follow some craft or trade. Franklin was particularly harsh on those who sought hereditary privilege or who had “no other quality to recommend him but his birth.” In America, he said, “people do not enquire of a stranger, What is he? but, What can he do?” Reflecting his own pride in discovering that he had hardworking forebears rather than aristocratic ones, he said that a true American “would think himself more obliged to a genealogist who could prove for him that his ancestors and relations for ten generations had been ploughmen, smiths, carpenters, turners, weavers, tanners or even shoemakers, and consequently that they were useful members of society, than if he could only prove that they were Gentlemen, doing nothing of value but living idly on the labor of others.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>America was creating a society, Franklin proclaimed, where a “mere man of Quality” who does not want to work would be “despised and disregarded,” while anyone who has a useful skill would be honored. All of this made for a better moral clime. “The almost general mediocrity of fortune that prevails in America, obliging its people to follow some business for subsistence, those vices that arise usually from idleness are in a great measure prevented,” he concluded. “Industry and constant employment are great preservatives of morals and virtue.” He purported to be describing the way America was, but he was also subtly prescribing what he wanted it to become. All in all, it was his best paean to the middle-class values he represented and helped to make integral to the new nation’s character.<a href="part0030_split_015.html#ch_15_en_57" id="ch_15_een_57"><sup class="calibre7">57</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin’s affection for the middle class and its virtues of hard work and frugality meant that his social theories tended to be a blend of conservatism (as we have seen, he was dubious of generous welfare laws that led to dependency among the poor) and populism (he was opposed to the privileges of inheritance and to wealth idly gained through ownership of large estates). In 1784, he expanded on these ideas by questioning the morality of excess personal luxuries.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>“I have not,” he lamented to Benjamin Vaughan, “thought of a remedy for luxury.” On the one hand, the desire for luxury spurred people to work hard. He recalled how his wife had once given a fancy hat to a country girl, and soon all the other girls in the village were working hard spinning mittens in order to earn money to buy fancy hats. This appealed to his utilitarian sentiments: “Not only the girls were made happier by having fine caps, but the Philadelphians by the supply of warm mittens.” However, too much time spent seeking luxuries was wasteful and “a public evil.” So he suggested that America should impose heavy duties on the importation of frivolous fineries.<a href="part0030_split_015.html#ch_15_en_58" id="ch_15_een_58"><sup class="calibre7">58</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>His antipathy to excess wealth also led him to defend high taxes, especially on luxuries. A person had a “natural right” to all he earned that was necessary to support himself and his family, he wrote finance minister Robert Morris, “but all property superfluous to such purposes is the property of the public, who by their laws have created it.” Likewise, to Vaughan, he argued that cruel criminal laws had been wrought by those who sought to protect excess ownership of property. “Superfluous property is the creature of society,” he said. “Simple and mild laws were sufficient to guard the property that was merely necessary.”<a href="part0030_split_015.html#ch_15_en_59" id="ch_15_een_59"><sup class="calibre7">59</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>To some of his contemporaries, both rich and poor, Franklin’s social philosophy seemed an odd mix of conservative and radical beliefs. In fact, however, it formed a very coherent leather-apron outlook. Unlike many subsequent revolutions, the American was not a radical rebellion by an oppressed proletariat. Instead, it was led largely by propertied and shopkeeping citizens whose rather bourgeois rallying cry was “No taxation without representation.” Franklin’s blend of beliefs would become part of the outlook of much of America’s middle class: its faith in the virtues of hard work and frugality, its benevolent belief in voluntary associations to help others, its conservative opposition to handouts that led to laziness and dependency, and its slightly ambivalent resentment of unnecessary luxury, hereditary privileges, and an idle landowning leisure class.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>The end of the war permitted the resumption of amiable correspondence with old friends in England, most notably his fellow printer William Strahan, to whom he had written the famous but unsent letter nine years earlier declaring “You are now my enemy.” By 1780, he had mellowed enough to draft a letter signed “Your formerly affectionate friend,” which he then changed to “Your long affectionate humble servant.” By 1784, he was signing himself “Most affectionately.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Once again, they debated Franklin’s theories that top government officials should serve without pay and that England’s society and government were inherently corrupt. Now, however, the tone was bantering as Franklin suggested that the Americans, who “have some remains of affection” for the British, perhaps should help govern <span class="italic"><span>them.</span></span> “If you have not sense and virtue enough left to govern yourselves,” he wrote, “dissolve your present old crazy constitution and send members to Congress.” Lest Strahan not realize he was joking, Franklin confessed, “You will say my advice smells of Madeira. You are right. This foolish letter is mere chitchat between ourselves over the second bottle.”<a href="part0030_split_015.html#ch_15_en_60" id="ch_15_een_60"><sup class="calibre7">60</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin also spent the early summer of 1784 adding more to his memoirs. He had written about 40 percent of what would become his famous <span class="italic"><span>Autobiography</span></span> at Bishop Shipley’s in Twyford in 1771. Now he responded to a request from Vaughan, who said that Franklin’s story would help to explain the “manners of a rising people,” and in Passy wrote what would become another 10 percent of that work. His focus at the time was on the need to build a new American character, and most of the section he wrote in 1784 was devoted to an explanation of the famous self-improvement project in which he sought to train himself in the thirteen virtues ranging from frugality and industry to temperance and humility.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>His Passy friends were especially thrilled by the tale of the slate booklet Franklin used to record his efforts at acquiring these virtues. Franklin, who still had not fully acquired all aspects of humility, proudly showed off the tablets to Cabanis, the young physician who lived with Madame Helvétius. “We touched this precious booklet,” Cabanis exulted in his journal. “We held it in our hands. Here was, in a way, the chronological story of Franklin’s soul!”<a href="part0030_split_015.html#ch_15_en_61" id="ch_15_een_61"><sup class="calibre7">61</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>In his spare time, Franklin perfected one of his most famous and useful inventions: bifocal glasses. Writing to a friend in August 1784, he announced himself “happy in the invention of Double Spectacles, which, serving for distant objects as well as near ones, make my eyes as useful to me as ever they were.” A few months later, in response to a request for more information about “your invention,” Franklin provided details:</span></p>
<div class="extract">
<p class="extractText"><span>The same convexity of glass through which a man sees clearest and best at the distance proper for reading is not the best for greater distances. I therefore had formerly two pair of spectacles, which I shifted occasionally, as in traveling I sometimes read, and often wanted to regard the prospects. Finding this change troublesome, and not always sufficiently ready, I had the glasses cut and half of each kind associated in the same circle. By this means, as I wear my spectacles constantly, I have only to move my eyes up or down, as I want to see distinctly far or near, the proper glasses being always ready.<a href="part0030_split_015.html#ch_15_en_62" id="ch_15_een_62"><sup class="calibre7">62</sup></a></span></p>
</div>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span>A portrait by Charles Willson Peale, done in 1785, shows him wearing his new spectacles.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Because of his renown both as a scientist and a rationalist, Franklin was appointed by the king in 1784 to a commission to investigate the theories of Friedrich Anton Mesmer, whose advocacy of a new method of healing led to the new word “mesmerize.” (Another member of Franklin’s commission, Dr. Joseph-Ignace Guillotin, would also have his name turned into a neologism during the French Revolution.) A flamboyant healer from Vienna, Mesmer believed that maladies were caused by the artificial disruption of a universal fluid emitted by heavenly bodies and they could be cured by the techniques of animal magnetism he had discovered. His treatment involved putting patients around huge oak tubs filled with glass and iron filings while a healer, carrying an iron wand, magnetized and mesmerized them. In a sign that the Enlightenment was losing its grip, Mesmerism became wildly popular in Paris, replacing ballooning as the fad of the moment, with adherents that included Lafayette, Temple Franklin, and Queen Marie-Antoinette.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Many of the commission’s meetings were held in Passy, where Franklin himself, in the name of science, submitted to the treatments. In his diary, 14-year-old Benny recorded one session where Mesmer’s disciples, “after having magnetized many sick persons…are gone into the garden to magnetize some trees.” It was clear that the power of suggestion could produce some strange effects. The commissioners, however, decided that “our role was to keep cool, rational and open-minded.” So they blindfolded the patients, not letting them know whether or not they were being treated by Mesmer’s doctors. “We discovered we could influence them ourselves so that their answers were the same, whether they had been magnetized or not.” They concluded that Mesmer was a fraud and what was at work was, at they put it in their report, “the power of imagination.” An unpublished annex to the report did note that the treatment was powerful at sexually stimulating young women when “titillations delicieuses” were applied.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin wrote to Temple, who was no longer a disciple of Mesmer, that the report had roundly debunked the theories. “Some think it will put an end to Mesmerism,” he said, “but there is a wonderful deal of credulity in the world, and deceptions as absurd have supported themselves for ages.”<a href="part0030_split_015.html#ch_15_en_63" id="ch_15_een_63"><sup class="calibre7">63</sup></a></span></p>
<h3 class="chapterHeadA">Finale</h3>
<p class="para"><span>One source of despair for Franklin was that, in negotiating treaties with other European nations, he had to work with John Adams again. He was worried, he told one friend, about “what will be the offspring of a coalition between my ignorance and his positiveness.” Adams’s brief period of mellowness had lasted for only a few months after the signing of the provisional peace with Britain, and he subsequently resumed his backbiting. Franklin was an “unintelligible politician,” Adams wrote Robert Livingston. “If this gentleman and the marble Mercury in the garden of Versailles were in nomination for an embassy, I would not hesitate to give my vote for the statue, upon the principle that it would do no harm.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>So Franklin was thrilled when Thomas Jefferson, who had twice resisted congressional commissions to join Franklin and Adams as a minister in Paris, finally relented and arrived there in August 1784. Jefferson was everything that Adams was not: diplomatic and charming, partial to France, secure rather than jealous, a lover of women and social gaiety with no Puritan prudishness. He was also a philosopher, inventor, and scientist whose Enlightenment curiosity meshed perfectly with Franklin’s.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>To make matters even better, Jefferson was fully aware of the darkness that infected Adams. James Madison had written him to complain that Adams’s letters were “a display of his vanity, his prejudice against the French court and his venom against Dr. Franklin.” Jefferson replied, “He hates Franklin, he hates Jay, he hates the French, he hates the English. To whom will he adhere?”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Jefferson shared Franklin’s belief that idealism and realism should both play a role in foreign policy. “The best interest of nations, like men, was to follow the dictates of conscience,” he declared. And unlike Adams, he completely revered Franklin. “More respect and veneration attached to the character of Dr. Franklin in France than to that of any other person, foreign or native,” he wrote, and he proclaimed Franklin “the greatest man and ornament of the age.” When word spread, a few months later, that he was being tapped to replace Franklin, Jefferson gave his famed reply: “No one can replace him, Sir, I am only his successor.”<a href="part0030_split_015.html#ch_15_en_64" id="ch_15_een_64"><sup class="calibre7">64</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Jefferson dined often with Franklin, played chess with him, and listened to his lectures about the loyalty America owed France. His calming presence even helped Franklin and Adams get along better, and the three men who had worked together on the Declaration now worked together at Passy almost every day throughout September preparing for new European treaties and commercial pacts. There was, in fact, a lot that the three patriots could agree on. They shared a faith in free trade, open covenants, and the need to end the mercantilist system of repressive commercial arrangements and restrictive spheres of influence. As Adams, with uncharacteristic generosity, noted, “We proceeded with wonderful harmony, good humor and unanimity.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>For both men and nations, it was a season of reconciliation. If Franklin could repair his relationship with Adams, there was even hope that he could do so with his son. “Dear and honored father,” William wrote from England that summer. “Ever since the termination of the unhappy contest between Great Britain and America, I have been anxious to write to you, and to endeavor to revive that affectionate intercourse and connection which, until the commencement of the late troubles, had been the pride and happiness of my life.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>It was a noble, gracious, and plaintive gesture from a son who, through it all, had never said anything bad about his estranged father nor stopped loving him. But William was still a Franklin, and he could not bring himself to admit that he had been in the wrong, nor to apologize. “If I have been mistaken, I cannot help it. It is an error of judgment that the maturest reflection I am capable of cannot rectify; and I verily believe were the same circumstances to occur again tomorrow, my conduct would be exactly similar to what it was.” He offered to come to Paris if his father did not want to come to England so they could settle their issues with “a personal interview.”<a href="part0030_split_015.html#ch_15_en_65" id="ch_15_een_65"><sup class="calibre7">65</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin’s response revealed his pain, but it also offered some hints of hope. He began by saying he was “glad to find that you desire to revive the affectionate intercourse,” and he even brought himself to add, “it will be agreeable to me.” Yet he immediately segued from love to anger:</span></p>
<div class="extract">
<p class="extractText"><span>Indeed nothing has ever hurt me so much and affected me with such keen sensations as to find myself deserted in my old age by my only son; and not only deserted, but to find him taking up arms against me, in a cause, wherein my good fame, fortune and life were all at stake. You conceived, you say, that your duty to your King and regard for your country required this. I ought not to blame you for differing in sentiment with me in public affairs. We are men, all subject to errors. Our opinions are not in our own power; they are formed and governed much by circumstances, that are often as inexplicable as they are irresistible. Your situation was such that few would have censured your remaining neuter, <span class="italic"><span>though there are natural duties which precede political ones</span></span> [emphasis is Franklin’s].</span></p>
</div>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span>Then he caught himself. “This is a disagreeable subject,” he wrote. “I drop it.” It would not be convenient, he added, to “have you come here at the present.” Instead, Temple would be sent to London to act as an intermediary. “You may confide to your son the family affairs you wish to confer upon with me.” Then, a bit condescendingly, he added, “I trust you will prudently avoid introducing him to company that it may be improper for him to be seen with.” Temple may have been William’s son, but Franklin made it clear who controlled him.<a href="part0030_split_015.html#ch_15_en_66" id="ch_15_een_66"><sup class="calibre7">66</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>At 24, Temple had little of his grandfather’s wisdom but possessed a lot more of the normal emotions that bind families, even estranged ones. He had long been hoping, he wrote a London friend, to return there to “embrace my father.” On his visit to England, he nevertheless was careful to show fealty to his grandfather, even asking for permission before accompanying his father on a trip to the seashore.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>After a few weeks, Franklin began to fear that Temple might be forsaking him for his father, and he chided him for not writing enough. “I have waited with impatience the arrival of every post. But not a word.” Among other things, Franklin complained, this was embarrassing him with those who kept asking whether he had heard from Temple: “Judge what I must feel, what they must think, and tell me what I am to think of such neglect.” Of all the members of his family, Temple alone could cause such jealousy and possessiveness.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>For his part, Temple was thoroughly enjoying himself. He was treated as a celebrity prince: feted by the Royal Society, the Lord Mayor, and various ladies who held teas in his honor. He had his portrait painted by Gilbert Stuart, and a friend gave him a list of the best bootmakers and tailors, adding, “And when lewd, go to the following safe girls who I think are quite handsome.”<a href="part0030_split_015.html#ch_15_en_67" id="ch_15_een_67"><sup class="calibre7">67</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Temple was not able to resolve the issues dividing his father and grandfather, but he was able to accomplish another part of his mission: enticing Polly Stevenson to come to Passy. Now 45, she had been widowed for a decade, and her mother, Franklin’s longtime landlady and companion, had died a year earlier. (She “loved you with the most ardent affection,” Polly had written when conveying the sad news.) Franklin had written Polly that she must come see him soon, for he was now like a building that required “so many repairs that in a little time the Owner will find it cheaper to pull it down and build a new one.” By the end of the summer of 1784, his letters had become even more plaintive. “Come, my dear friend, live with me while I stay here, and go with me, if I do go, to America.”<a href="part0030_split_015.html#ch_15_en_68" id="ch_15_een_68"><sup class="calibre7">68</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>In early December 1784, many people converged on Passy and provided for Franklin, during his final winter in France, a most satisfying version of the hybrid families, real and adopted, he so loved to assemble around him. There to pamper him were Temple and Benny, Polly and her three children, Thomas Jefferson and other great minds, plus Mesdames Brillon and Helvétius along with their wonderful retinues. “For a fragile moment,” note Claude-Anne Lopez and Eugenia Herbert, “his various ‘families’ were almost in perfect poise, drawing closer in a network of good will of which he was the center.”<a href="part0030_split_015.html#ch_15_en_69" id="ch_15_een_69"><sup class="calibre7">69</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Polly was amused by Temple on first seeing him again in London after ten years, and she joked with Franklin about how he had tried to keep the boy’s lineage secret back then. “We see a strong resemblance of you, and indeed saw it when we did not think ourselves at liberty to say we did, as we pretended to be as ignorant as you supposed we were, or chose that we should be.” That gave her an opportunity to chide them both a bit: “I believe you may have been handsomer than your grandson is, but then you never were so genteel.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>But close familiarity with Temple did not, except in his grandfather’s case, necessarily breed fondness, and Polly became somewhat disenchanted with him after their arrival in Passy. “He has such a love of dress,” she wrote a relative, “and is so absorbed in self-importance and so engaged in the pursuit of pleasure that he is not an amiable or respectable character.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Benny, on the other hand, with the benefit of his Geneva education and natural eagerness to please, struck Polly as “sensible and manly in his manner without the slightest tincture of the coxcomb.” He wore his hair like an English lad rather than a French fop, and “with the simplicity of his dress retains a lovely simplicity of character.” Temple might look more like Franklin, but Benny—who swam in the Seine, flew kites with a passion, took Polly on tours of Paris, and yet was ever diligent in his printing work—resembled him more “in mind.”<a href="part0030_split_015.html#ch_15_en_70" id="ch_15_een_70"><sup class="calibre7">70</sup></a></span></p>
<h3 class="chapterHeadA">Adieu</h3>
<p class="para"><span>There were times, indeed many of them, when Franklin wrote of his inclination not to disrupt this little paradise, but instead to remain in France and die among those who so loved and pleased him. His gout and his kidney stones made the prospect of an ocean voyage something to dread, while the embers of his passions for the ladies of Paris were something he could still savor. In May 1785, he wrote a friend recalling one of his favorite old drinking songs:</span></p>
<div class="extract">
<p class="extractVerse"><span><span class="italic"><span>May I govern my Passions with an absolute sway,</span></span></span></p>
<p class="extractVerse"><span><span class="italic"><span>Grow wiser and better as my Strength wears away,</span></span></span></p>
<p class="extractVerse"><span><span class="italic"><span>Without Gout or Stone, by a gentle Decay.</span></span></span></p>
</div>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span>“But what signifies our wishing?” he asked. “I have sung that wishing song a thousand times, when I was young, and now find, at fourscore, that the three contraries have befallen me, being subject to the gout and the stone, and not being yet master of all my passions.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Nevertheless, when word reached him that month that the Congress had at long last accepted his resignation and that Temple was not being offered an overseas assignment, Franklin decided it was time to go home. From Passy he wrote Polly, who had returned to England, begging her to accompany him. He had taken the liberty of reserving a spacious cabin for her whole family. “You may never have so good an opportunity.” For the time being at least, she decided to stay in England.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>He sent word of his travel plans to his sister Jane and explained, “I have continued to work until late in the day; ’tis time I should go home, and go to bed.” Such metaphors had begun to creep into his writing, and he expanded on them to his friend David Hartley, who had helped him during his many negotiations. “We were long fellow laborers in the best of all works, the work of peace,” he wrote. “I leave you still in the field, but having finished my day’s work, I am going home <span class="italic"><span>to go to bed</span></span>! Wish me a good night’s rest, as I do you a pleasant evening. Adieu!”<a href="part0030_split_015.html#ch_15_en_71" id="ch_15_een_71"><sup class="calibre7">71</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>The farewells at Passy were dramatic and tearful. “Every day of my life I shall remember that a great man, a sage, has wanted to be my friend,” Madame Brillon wrote after their final meeting. “If it ever pleases you to remember the woman who loved you the most, think of me.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Madame Helvétius was not to be outdone. “Come back, my dear friend, come back to us,” she wrote in a letter dispatched to catch up with him as he boarded his boat. To each of his friends went a gift that was to become a relic: Cabanis got the hollow cane that magically stilled the waves, the Abbé Morellet a tool chest and armchair, and his landlord Chaumont a table that could be ingeniously raised and lowered. (He also gave Chaumont a bill for the improvements he had made to his apartments, including installing a lightning rod and fixing the chimney “to cure it of its intolerable malady of smoke.”)</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>To ease his travel to the port of Le Havre, Queen Marie-Antoinette sent her personal enclosed litter borne by surefooted Spanish mules. Her husband, King Louis XVI, sent a miniature portrait of himself surrounded by 408 small diamonds. Franklin also exchanged gifts with Vergennes, who noted to an aide that “the United States will never have a more zealous and more useful servant than M. Franklin.”<a href="part0030_split_015.html#ch_15_en_72" id="ch_15_een_72"><sup class="calibre7">72</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>On the day he left Passy, July 12, Benny recorded in his diary, “A mournful silence reigned around him, broken only by a few sobs.” Jefferson had come to see him off, and he later recalled: “The ladies smothered him with embraces, and on his introducing me as his successor, I told him I wished he would transfer these privileges to me, but he answered, ‘You are too young a man.’ ”<a href="part0030_split_015.html#ch_15_en_73" id="ch_15_een_73"><sup class="calibre7">73</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin’s plan was to cross the English Channel and then determine whether he felt he could endure an ocean crossing. If not, he would ferry back to Le Havre, and the Queen’s litter, which waited there for word, would carry him back to Passy.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>As usual, however, travel was a tonic rather than travail for Franklin, and he turned out to be the only passenger not to get sick during the rough channel crossing. When they arrived in Southampton, he and his party went to visit a hot saltwater spa where, he noted in his journal, he bathed in the springs “and, floating on my back, fell asleep, and slept near an hour by my watch, without sinking or turning!”<a href="part0030_split_015.html#ch_15_en_74" id="ch_15_een_74"><sup class="calibre7">74</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>There was one last dramatic scene to be played out, one last emotional moment, before he could set sail on his eighth and final crossing of the Atlantic. For four days he stayed at the Star Inn in Southampton, so that he could receive some of his old English friends and bid them a final farewell. Bishop Shipley came, along with his daughter Kitty. So did Benjamin Vaughan, his back-channel missions for Jay and Temple forgiven, who was preparing to publish a new edition of his friend’s writings. There were grand dinners and celebrations, which he described in his journal as “very affectionate.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>But the main person who had come to see him at the Star Inn got only a brusque mention in his journal. “Met my son, who arrived from London the evening before,” Franklin noted. There was no reconciliation, no recorded tears or affection, just a cold negotiation over debts and property.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin had regained full control over Temple by then, and he drove a hard bargain on his grandson’s behalf. He insisted that William sell his New Jersey farm to Temple for less than he had paid, and he applied against the purchase price the decades of debts, carefully recorded, that William still owed him. He also took title to all of William’s land claims in New York. Having taken William’s son from him, he was now extracting his wealth and his connections to America.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>This final reunion of three generations of Franklin men, so fraught with father-son tensions, ended so coldly that none of them ever saw fit to discuss it. Franklin’s journal offers not a word of detail, nor is there any record of his ever writing or telling about it. He and his son never corresponded again. William wrote a letter to his half-sister, Sally, four days later, but amazingly, he rambled on about her children and a portrait he was trying to send her without ever describing the climactic scene. The closest he came, at the end of the long letter, was to lament, in discussing how everyone would soon be in Philadelphia, that “my fate has thrown me on a different side of the globe.” Even decades later, after his father and grandfather had both died and he finally got around to producing a collection of his grandfather’s life and works, Temple provided only a desultory and unrevealing phrase noting that at Southampton, Franklin “had the satisfaction of seeing his son, the former Governor of New Jersey.”<a href="part0030_split_015.html#ch_15_en_75" id="ch_15_een_75"><sup class="calibre7">75</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>William was not invited to the farewell party aboard his father’s vessel on the evening of July 27. Fully revitalized by travel and showing no remorse over the cool parting with his son, Franklin stayed up with his friends until 4 <small class="calibre3">A.M.</small> When he awoke late that morning, his friends were gone, his two grandsons were with him, and his ship was already under sail for home.</span></p>
<p id="ft_5" class="footnotetext"><span>*This is the rough equivalent of $130 million in purchasing power in 2002 U.S. dollars. In 1780, there were about 23.5 livres to the British pound, and £1 in 1780 had the same purchasing power as £83 in 2002. Although the American Congress had begun issuing paper currency denominated in dollars by 1780, the states continued to issue their own currencies, often in pounds. Rapid changes in the value of all American currencies during the Revolution made them difficult to compare to European currencies. By 1786, an ounce of gold cost $19 or £4.2, making £1 worth $4.52, which became the semiofficial exchange rate in 1790.
