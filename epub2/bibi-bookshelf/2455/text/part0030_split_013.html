<p id="ch_13_en_1" class="endnote"><span><a href="part0019.html#ch_13_een_1">1</a>. Franklin’s Passy journal, Oct. 4, 1778; BF to SF, May 10, 1785; BF to John Hancock, Dec. 8, 1776. He was writing to Hancock in his capacity as president of Congress.</span></p>
<p class="endnote"><span>Franklin’s social life in Paris has, not suprisingly, inspired many books. The most delightful include Lopez <span class="italic"><span>Cher;</span></span> Aldridge <span class="italic"><span>French;</span></span> Alsop; Schoenbrun. An older work of some value is Edward Hale Sr. and Edward Hale Jr., <span class="italic"><span>Franklin in France</span></span> (Boston: Roberts Brothers, 1888). It was also the subject of a musical, <span class="italic"><span>Ben Franklin in Paris,</span></span> by Mark Sandrich Jr. and Sidney Michaels, which premiered Oct. 27, 1964, and ran for 215 performances.</span></p>
<p id="ch_13_en_2" class="endnote"><span><a href="part0019.html#ch_13_een_2">2</a>. BF to SF, June 3, 1779; Aldridge <span class="italic"><span>French,</span></span> 43; Van Doren 632. The tale of the chamber pot given by the king to Comtesse Diane de Polignac comes from the memoirs of Madame Henriette de Campan, the lady-in-waiting to Marie-Antoinette. It is well enough known that it was told by the French ambassador at a ceremony in the Benjamin Franklin room of the U.S. State Department; see: www.info-france-usa.org/news/statmnts/1998/amba0910.asp. However, Claude-Anne Lopez tells me, “It comes from a very unreliable source, a snobbish sourpuss, and my guess is that it’s not true.” That said, Lopez included it without qualification in her own book, Lopez <span class="italic"><span>Cher,</span></span> 184.</span></p>

Temple’s letter is from Randall 455, citing TF to SF, Nov. 25, 1777. The quote from Madame Chaumont is from Adams Diary 4:64. I am grateful to Professor Thomas Schaeper of St. Bonaventure University for his help and his delightful, though hard to find, biography of Franklin’s landlord, <span class="italic"><span>France and America in the Revolutionary Era: The Life and Times of Jacques-Donatien Leray de Chaumont</span></span>(Providence, R.I.: Berghahn, 1995).</span></p>

<p class="endnote"><span>Some of the material is available in <span class="italic"><span>Material Relating to the American Revolution from the Auckland Papers</span></span> (Yorkshire, England: EP Microform, 1974) and in Benjamin Stevens, ed., <span class="italic"><span>Facsimiles of Manuscripts in European Archives Relating to America, 1773–1783</span></span> (25 volumes published in 1898, copies in the Franklin collection in Yale’s Sterling Library). Please note the acknowledgment to Susan Ann Bennett, who provided research help in London finding and transcribing some of the documents cited in this section.</span></p>
<p class="endnote"><span>I am also grateful to the Central Intelligence Agency’s Center for the Study of Intelligence for providing the declassified paper by John Vaillancourt, “Edward Bancroft (@Edwd. Edwards) Estimable Spy,” <span class="italic"><span>Studies in Intelligence</span></span> (winter 1961): A53–A67. See also Lewis Einstein, <span class="italic"><span>Divided Loyalties</span></span> (Boston: Ayer, 1933), 3–48; Cecil Currey, <span class="italic"><span>Code Number 72</span></span> (Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall, 1972); Samuel Bemis, “The British Secret Service and the French-American Alliance,” <span class="italic"><span>American Historical Review</span></span> 29.3 (Apr. 1924). There is also a historical novel, fun but heavily fictionalized, on Bancroft: Arthur Mullin, <span class="italic"><span>Spy: America’s First Double Agent, Dr. Edward Bancroft</span></span> (Santa Barbara, Calif.: Capra Press, 1987).</span></p>
<p class="endnote"><span>Currey argues that Franklin’s loyalties (and Deane’s) were also suspect. It’s an interesting and fact-filled book, but I think its analysis is unconvincing. Jonathan Dull, in <span class="italic"><span>Franklin the Diplomat</span></span> (Philadelphia: Transactions of the American Philosophical Society, 1982), 1:72, 36, and passim, convincingly argues that Franklin was oblivious to Bancroft’s dealings and that Deane was involved in stock speculating but not in spying with Bancroft.</span></p>

For a contemporary discussion of “hard power” versus “soft power,” see Joseph Nye, <span class="italic"><span>The Paradox of American Power</span></span>(New York: Oxford University Press, 2002). The “city upon a hill” image comes from Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount, Matthew 5:14: “Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.” It was used by John Winthrop in the sermon, “A Model of Christian Charity,” that he preached on Mar. 22, 1630, on the <span class="italic"><span>Arabella</span></span> while heading to America. Ronald Reagan used the image throughout his political career, most notably as the title of a Jan. 25, 1974, speech to the Conservative Political Action Committee, in his first 1980 debate with Jimmy Carter, in a 1980 debate with John Anderson, in his 1984 speech to the Republican Convention, and in his 1989 farewell speech.</span></p>

<p id="ch_13_en_25" class="endnote"><span><a href="part0019.html#ch_13_een_25">25</a>.

In the Sept. 4, 1777, letter to Washington, Franklin refers to Baron von Steuben as Baron de Steuben and inflates his rank from captain to lieutenant general. The spy Bancroft reported back to London that they had “received a resolve of Congress directing all their ministers” to discourage French mercenaries unless they spoke English, which “may enable us to cut short the solicitation with which we have for a long time almost been persecuted to death by thousands of officers wanting employment in America”; Edward Bancroft to Paul Wentworth, June 1777, Auckland papers, Add MSS 46490, f64.</span></p>

See also Dull, <span class="italic"><span>A Diplomatic History of the American Revolution,</span></span> 89. Dull argues that for months the French had been planning to enter the war against Britain in early 1778 once their naval rearmament program permitted; the American victory at Saratoga, he contends, was not a major factor. Others dispute this view. See Claude Van Tyne, “Influences Which Determined the French Government to Make Their Treaty with America,” <span class="italic"><span>American Historical Review</span></span> 21 (1915–16): 528, cited by Dull.</span></p>

It seems somewhat overdrawn in its assessment of Franklin’s duplicity, but it is carefully annotated and researched. See also James Perkins, <span class="italic"><span>France and the American Revolution</span></span> (New York: Franklin, 1970), 203–4.</span></p>

<p class="endnote"><span>Jonathan Dull discusses Bancroft’s stock manipulations in <span class="italic"><span>Franklin the Diplomat,</span></span> 33–36, and notes that Silas Deane, although in his opinion not a spy, was also able to make money by speculating with Wharton on Bancroft’s inside information. Also in on the scheme was Thomas Walpole, the wealthy and well-connected London banker who had tried with Franklin to win a land grant in Ohio. Deane died of poisoning in 1789 as he was preparing to sail from London to Canada, and some have speculated that he was murdered by Bancroft, an expert in poisons.</span></p>

See also Samuel Cooper to BF, July 1, 1778, in which the Boston clergyman describes how the treaty thwarted England’s attempts to lure Congress into a reconciliation and how information sent by Franklin and Adams about a British convoy of eleven warships would be passed along, presumably to warn French admiral d’Estaing.</span></p>
