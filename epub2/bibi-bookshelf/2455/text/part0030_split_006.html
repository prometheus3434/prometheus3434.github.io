Among those, in addition to Newton, who had already noted the similarities between electrical sparks and lightning were Francis Hauksbee, Samuel Wall, John Freke, Johann Heinrich Winkler, and Franklin’s antagonist the Abbé Nollet; see Clark 79–80. None, however, had proposed serious experiments to assess the hypothesis.</span></p>

<p id="ch_6_en_13" class="endnote"><span><a href="part0012.html#ch_6_een_13">13</a>. Cohen 66–109; Van Doren 164; Tom Tucker, <span class="italic"><span>Bolt of Fate</span></span> (New York: Public Affairs, 2003). Tucker charges that “It’s possible that…Franklin dreamed up his own kite claim” and that it was all a “hoax” akin to his literary ones. His book does not address the detailed evidence I. Bernard Cohen cites on this question and is, I think, unpersuasive. Franklin’s kite description is in no ways similar to his literary hoaxes, and if untrue would have been an outright lie rather than a hoax. Tucker also makes the odd allegation that Franklin’s description of his sentry box experiment was a death threat to the president of London’s Royal Society. He also charges that Franklin may have been lying when he publicly reported in 1752 that two lightning rods had been erected on public buildings in Philadelphia that summer (a report that was published in the Royal Society’s journal and would, it seems, have been challenged at the time if it were false). The comprehensive analysis by Cohen, a professor of the history of science who is the foremost authority on Franklin’s electricity work, addresses fully and more convincingly the issues surrounding Franklin’s sentry box, kite, and lightning rods. Other articles about whether Franklin flew the kite that summer include Abbott L. Rotch, “Did Franklin Fly His Electrical Kite before He Invented the Lighting Rod?” <span class="italic"><span>American Antiquarian Society Proceedings,</span></span> 1907; Alexander McAdie, “The Date of Franklin’s Kite Experiment,” <span class="italic"><span>American Antiquarian Society Proceedings,</span></span> 1925.</span></p>
<p id="ch_6_en_14" class="endnote"><span><a href="part0012.html#ch_6_een_14">14</a>. Cohen 66–109; Van Doren 165–70. Van Doren says that the possibility that Franklin fabricated or embellished his kite experiment would be “quite out of keeping with his record in science, in which he elsewhere appears always truthful and unpretending.”</span></p>
