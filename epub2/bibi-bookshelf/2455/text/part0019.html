<h3 class="chapterHeadA">The World’s Most Famous American</h3>
<p class="para"><span>The rough winter crossing aboard the <span class="italic"><span>Reprisal,</span></span> though a fast thirty days, “almost demolished me,” Franklin later recalled. The salt beef brought back his boils and rashes, the other food was too tough for his old teeth, and the small frigate pitched so violently that he barely slept. So, on sighting the coast of Brittany, an exhausted Franklin, unwilling to wait for winds to take him closer to Paris, had a fishing boat ferry him and his two bewildered grandchildren to the tiny village of Auray. Until he could get to Paris by coach, he wrote John Hancock, he would avoid taking “a public character” and try to keep a low profile, “thinking it prudent first to know whether the court is ready and willing to receive ministers publicly from the Congress.”<a href="part0030_split_013.html#ch_13_en_1" id="ch_13_een_1"><sup class="calibre7">1</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>France was not a place, however, where the world’s most famous American would find, nor truly seek, anonymity. When his carriage reached Nantes, the city feted him at a hastily arranged grand ball, where Franklin reigned as a celebrity philosopher-statesman and Temple marveled at the height of the women’s ornately adorned coiffures. After seeing Franklin’s soft fur cap, the ladies of Nantes began wearing wigs that imitated it, a style that became known as the <span class="italic"><span>coiffure à la Franklin.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>To the French, this lightning-defying scientist and tribune of liberty who had unexpectedly appeared on their shores was a symbol both of the virtuous frontier freedom romanticized by Rousseau and of the Enlightenment’s reasoned wisdom championed by Voltaire. For more than eight years he would play his roles to the hilt. In a clever and deliberate manner, leavened by the wit and joie de vivre the French so adored, he would cast the American cause, through his own personification of it, as that of the natural state fighting the corrupted one, the enlightened state fighting the irrational old order.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Into his hands, almost as much as those of Washington and others, had been placed the fate of the Revolution. Unless he could secure the support of France—its aid, its recognition, its navy—America would find it difficult to prevail. Already the greatest American scientist and writer of his time, he would display a dexterity that would make him the greatest American diplomat of all times. He played to the romance as well as the reason that entranced France’s <span class="italic"><span>philosophes,</span></span> to the fascination with America’s freedom that captivated its public, and to the cold calculation of national interest that moved its ministers.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>With its 440-year tradition of regular wars with England, France was a ripe potential ally, especially because it yearned to avenge the loss it suffered in the most recent American outcropping of these struggles, the Seven Years’ War. Just before he left, Franklin learned that France had agreed to send some aid to the American rebels secretly through a cutout commercial entity.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>But convincing France to do more was not going to be easy. The nation was now financially strapped, ostensibly at peace with Britain, and understandably cautious about betting big on a country that, after Washington’s precipitous retreat from Long Island, looked like a loser. In addition, neither Louis XVI nor his ministers were instinctive champions of America’s desire, which might prove contagious, to cast off hereditary monarchs.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Among Franklin’s cards was his fame, and he was among a long line of statesmen, from Richelieu to Metternich to Kissinger, to realize that with celebrity came cachet, and with that came influence. His lightning theories had been proved in France in 1752, his collected works published there in 1773, and a new edition of Poor Richard’s <span class="italic"><span>The Way to Wealth,</span></span> entitled <span class="italic"><span>La Science du Bonhomme Richard,</span></span> was published soon after his arrival and reprinted four times in two years. His fame was so great that people lined the streets hoping to get a glimpse of his entry into Paris on December 21, 1776.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Within weeks, all of fashionable Paris seemed to desire some display of his benign countenance. Medallions were struck in various sizes, engravings and portraits were hung in homes, and his likeness graced snuffboxes and signet rings. “The numbers sold are incredible,” he wrote his daughter, Sally. “These, with the pictures, busts and prints (of which copies upon copies are spread everywhere), have made your father’s face as well known as that of the moon.” The fad went so far as to mildly annoy, though still amuse, the king himself. He gave the Comtesse Diane de Polignac, who had bored him often with her praise of Franklin, a Sèvres porcelain chamber pot with his cameo embossed inside.<a href="part0030_split_013.html#ch_13_en_2" id="ch_13_een_2"><sup class="calibre7">2</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>“His reputation was more universal than that of Leibniz, Frederick or Voltaire, and his character more loved and esteemed,” John Adams would recall many years later, after his own jealousy of Franklin’s fame had somewhat subsided. “There was scarcely a peasant or a citizen, a valet de chambre, coachman or footman, a lady’s chambermaid or a scullion in the kitchen who was not familiar with Franklin’s name.”<a href="part0030_split_013.html#ch_13_en_3" id="ch_13_een_3"><sup class="calibre7">3</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>The French even tried to claim him as one of their own. He always assumed, as noted at the beginning of this book, that his surname came from the class of landowning English freemen known as franklins, and he was almost surely correct. But the <span class="italic"><span>Gazette</span></span> of Amiens reported that the name Franquelin was common in the province of Picardie, from which many families had emigrated to England.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Various groups of French philosophers, in addition to the disciples of Voltaire and Rousseau, also made intellectual claims on him. Most notable were the physiocrats, who pioneered the field of economics and developed the doctrine of laissez-faire. The group became for him a new Junto, and he wrote essays for their monthly journal.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>One of the most famous physiocrats, Pierre-Samuel Du Pont de Nemours (who emigrated in 1799 and with his son founded the Du-Pont chemical company), described his friend Franklin in almost mythic terms. “His eyes reveal a perfect equanimity,” he wrote, “and his lips the smile of an unalterable serenity.” Others were awed by the fact that he dressed so plainly and wore no wig. “Everything in him announced the simplicity and the innocence of primitive morals,” marveled one Parisian, who added the perfect French compliment about his love of silence: “He knew how to be impolite without being rude.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>His taciturnity and unadorned dress led many to mistake him for a Quaker. One French cleric reported shortly after Franklin’s arrival, “This Quaker wears the full dress of his sect. He has a handsome physiognomy, glasses always on his eyes, very little hair, a fur cap, which he always wears.” It was an impression he did little to correct, for Franklin knew that fascination about the Quakers was fashionable in France. Voltaire had famously extolled their peaceful simplicity in four of his “Letters on England,” and as Carl Van Doren has noted, “Paris admired the sect for its gentle and resolute merits.”<a href="part0030_split_013.html#ch_13_en_4" id="ch_13_een_4"><sup class="calibre7">4</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin was well aware of, and amused by, the image he created for himself. Picture me, he wrote a friend, “very plainly dressed, wearing my thin gray straight hair that peeps out under my only coiffure, a fine fur cap, which comes down to my forehead almost to my spectacles. Think how this must appear among the powdered heads of Paris.” It was a very different image from the one he had adopted, and wrote Polly about, during his first visit in 1767, when he bought “a little bag wig” and had his tailor “transform me into a Frenchman.”<a href="part0030_split_013.html#ch_13_en_5" id="ch_13_een_5"><sup class="calibre7">5</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Indeed, his new rustic look was partly a pose, the clever creation of America’s first great image-maker and public relations master. He wore his soft marten fur cap, the one he had picked up on his trip to Canada, during most of his social outings, including when he was received at the famous literary salon of Madame du Deffand shortly after his arrival, and it became a feature in the portraits and medallions of him. The cap, like that worn by Rousseau, served as his badge of homespun purity and New World virtue, just as his ever-present spectacles (also featured in portraits) became an emblem of wisdom. It helped him play the part that Paris imagined for him: that of the noble frontier philosopher and simple backwoods sage—even though he had lived most of his life on Market Street and Craven Street.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin reciprocated France’s adoration. “I find them a most amiable nation to live with,” he wrote Josiah Quincy. “The Spaniards are by common opinion supposed to be cruel, the English proud, the Scotch insolent, the Dutch avaricious, etc., but I think the French have no national vice ascribed to them. They have some frivolities, but they are harmless.” As he put it to a Boston relative, “This is the civilest nation upon earth.”<a href="part0030_split_013.html#ch_13_en_6" id="ch_13_een_6"><sup class="calibre7">6</sup></a></span></p>
<h3 class="chapterHeadA">Franklin’s Court at Passy</h3>
<p class="para"><span>In England, Franklin had set up a cozy household with a surrogate family. In France, he quickly assembled not merely a household but a miniature court. It was situated, both figuratively and geographically, between the salons of Paris and the palace at Versailles, and it would grow to include not only the requisite new family but also a visiting cast of fellow commissioners, deputies, spies, intellectuals, courtiers, and flirtatious female admirers.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>The village of Passy, where Franklin reigned over this coterie, was a collection of villas and chateaux about three miles from the center of Paris on the edge of the Bois de Boulogne. One of the finest of these estates was owned by Jacques-Donatien Leray de Chaumont, a nou-veau riche merchant who had made a fortune trading in the East Indies and was now motivated—by sincere sympathies as well as the prospect of profit—to associate himself with the American cause. He offered, initially at no rent, rooms and board to Franklin and his crowd, and his Passy compound became America’s first foreign embassy.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>It was an idyllic arrangement for Franklin. He had a “fine house” and a “large garden to walk in” as well as an “abundance of acquaintances,” he wrote to Mrs. Stevenson. The only thing missing was “that order and economy in my family that reigned in it when under your direction,” he added, giving only the slightest hint that he might like her to come over and be his household partner again. But it was not a suggestion that he pushed, for he found himself quite comfortable with a new set of domestic and female companions. “I never remember to have seen my grandfather in better health,” Temple wrote Sally. “The air of Passy and the warm bath three times a week have made quite a young man out of him. His pleasing gaiety makes everybody in love with him, especially the ladies, who permit him always to kiss them.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Chaumont’s main house (on which Franklin erected a lightning rod) was set amid chains of pavilions, formal gardens, stately terraces, and an octagonal pond that overlooked the Seine. Dinners, served at 2 <small class="calibre3">P.M.</small>, were seven-course extravaganzas, and Franklin built a wine collection that soon included more than one thousand bottles of Bordeaux, champagne, and sherry. The witty Madame Chaumont served as hostess, and her eldest daughter became Franklin’s “ma femme.” He also took a fancy to the teenage daughter of the seigneur of the village, whom he referred to wishfully as his “mistress.” (When she ended up marrying the Marquis de Tonnerre, Madame Chaumont punned, “All the rods of Mr. Franklin could not prevent the lightning [in French, <span class="italic"><span>tonnerre</span></span>] from falling on Mademoiselle.”)</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Through his trading companies, Chaumont procured supplies for the American cause, including saltpeter and uniforms. Because he emulated Poor Richard’s injunction to do well by doing good, many questioned his motives. “He would grasp, if he could, the commerce of the thirteen colonies for himself alone,” wrote one newspaper.<a href="part0030_split_013.html#ch_13_en_7" id="ch_13_een_7"><sup class="calibre7">7</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Chaumont also served as Franklin’s publicist. He commissioned the great Italian sculptor Giovanni Battista Nini to produce a series of Franklin medallions and the king’s portraitist Joseph-Siffrèd Duplessis to do a majestic oil painting of him. Franklin’s favorite, the Duplessis now hangs in a room atop the grand stairway of New York’s Metropolitan Museum (others by Duplessis are in Washington’s National Portrait Gallery and elsewhere).</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Benny was placed in a nearby boarding school, where he quickly mastered French; he came to dine, occasionally with some American classmates, with his grandfather every Sunday. Jonathan Williams, a grandnephew, arrived from England and for a while was entrusted to oversee commercial transactions. Temple served as Franklin’s very loyal aide, though not a great one; he became a bit of a playboy who had yet to master most of his grandfather’s thirteen virtues.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin, who was kept busy wrestling with the complexities of arms shipments and commercial transactions, would need whatever loyalty and family support he could muster, as he would find himself working alongside one co-commissioner who was corrupt, another who hated everyone, a secretary who was a spy, a cook who was an embezzler, and a landlord who hoped to be a profiteer.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Of the motley lot, the corrupt commissioner, who was in fact quite congenial and not all that dishonest, was Franklin’s favorite. Silas Deane of Connecticut had arrived in France in July 1776, five months before Franklin, and helped arrange France’s first secret shipment of aid. In that endeavor, he worked with a most unlikely middleman: Pierre-Augustin Caron de Beaumarchais, a diplomatic dabbler, would-be profiteer, and the world-famous dramatist who had just written <span class="italic"><span>The Barber of Seville</span></span> and was soon to write <span class="italic"><span>The Marriage of Figaro.</span></span> Like Beaumarchais, Deane seemed to have sticky fingers and inscrutable accounting methods. He would be recalled in a year to face, and fail, a congressional audit. But Franklin remained friendly throughout.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>The great antagonist amid this menagerie, to Deane and then to Franklin, was the third American commissioner, Arthur Lee of Virginia. He was suspicious of all around him to the point of paranoia, a trait only partly vindicated by the fact that he was right in many cases. He had been jealous of Franklin since serving with him as a colonial agent in London (and being part of a rival land scheme syndicate). Along with his brothers, William Lee and Richard Henry Lee, he was behind many of the rumors casting doubts on Franklin’s loyalty and character.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>As soon as he had succeeded in exposing, with some justification, Deane’s dubious transactions, Lee embarked on a campaign, with no justification, to cast doubt on Franklin. “I am more and more satisfied that the old doctor is concerned in the plunder,” he wrote his brother. He later noted, this time with a bit more justification, that Franklin was “more devoted to pleasure than would become even a young man in his station.”<a href="part0030_split_013.html#ch_13_en_8" id="ch_13_een_8"><sup class="calibre7">8</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Having once thought Franklin too soft on England, Lee now thought him too soft on France. He was also convinced that nearly everyone at Passy was a spy or a crook, and he fretted over every detail down to the color of the uniforms being sent to America and the fact that Deane had gotten rooms closer to Franklin’s.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>On rare occasions, Lee and Franklin put aside their animosity as they discussed their common cause. One evening at Passy, Franklin regaled him at length with the grand tale of July 1776, all of which Lee, who had been in London at the time, recorded reverentially in his diary. It was “a miracle in human affairs,” Franklin recounted, one that would result in “the greatest revolution the world ever saw.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>By early 1778, however, Lee and Franklin would barely be speaking to each other. “I have a right to know your reasons for treating me thus,” Lee wrote, after a barrage of his resentful letters had gone unanswered. Franklin let loose with the angriest words he is known to have ever written:</span></p>
<div class="extract">
<p class="extractText"><span>Sir: It is true I have omitted answering some of your letters. I do not like to answer angry letters. I hate disputes. I am old, cannot have long to live, have much to do and no time for altercation. If I have often received and borne your magisterial snubbings and rebukes without reply, ascribe it to the right causes, my concern for the honor &amp; success of our mission, which would be hurt by our quarrelling, my love of peace, my respect for your good qualities, and my pity of your sick mind, which is forever tormenting itself, with its jealousies, suspicions &amp; fancies that others mean you ill, wrong you, or fail in respect for you. If you do not cure your self of this temper it will end in insanity, of which it is the symptomatic forerunner, as I have seen in several instances. God preserve you from so terrible an evil: and for His sake pray suffer me to live in quiet.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="para"><span>As with his other famous angry letter, the one calling his friend Strahan an enemy, Franklin did not send this one. Although he meant every word of it, he was generally averse to altercations, and was now, as he noted, too old for them. Instead, on the following day, he wrote Lee a slightly milder response. In the revised version, he again admitted that he had not answered some of Lee’s letters, “particularly your angry ones in which you with very magisterial airs schooled and documented me as if I had been one of your domestics.” Instead, he had burned these letters, he said, because “I saw in the strongest light the importance of our living in a decent civility towards each other.” He complained to Deane, “I bear all his rebukes with patience for the good of the service, but it goes a little hard on me.”<a href="part0030_split_013.html#ch_13_en_9" id="ch_13_een_9"><sup class="calibre7">9</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Lee attracted like-minded visitors who proved equally annoying. His brother William had been sent as envoy to Austria but, not being received there, ended up in Paris. So, too, did Ralph Izard, a wealthy and jealous South Carolina planter, who came after finding himself unwelcome as an envoy in Tuscany. When Izard took the side of the Lees, Franklin retaliated with an anonymous satire, “The Petition of the Letter Z, Commonly called Ezzard, Zed, or Izard.” In it the letter Z complains about being “placed at the tail end of the alphabet” and “totally excluded from the word <small class="calibre3">WISE</small>.”<a href="part0030_split_013.html#ch_13_en_10" id="ch_13_een_10"><sup class="calibre7">10</sup></a></span></p>
<h3 class="chapterHeadA">Bancroft the Spy</h3>
<p class="para"><span>Arthur Lee was particularly vituperative toward Edward Bancroft, the secretary of the American delegation. Bancroft was an intriguing character in all senses of those two words. Born in Massachusetts in 1744, he had been tutored as a young man by Silas Deane and then went to work at age 19 on a plantation in Guiana, where he wrote about tropical plants and patented a textile dye made from a native black oak bark. In 1767, at age 23, he moved to London, where he became a physician and stock speculator. There he befriended Franklin, who sponsored his election to the Royal Society and paid him to gather intelligence on British leaders. When Deane was preparing to leave for France in March 1776, he was instructed by Franklin to “procure a meeting with Mr. Bancroft by writing a letter to him, under cover to Mr. Griffiths at Turnham Green near London, and desiring him to come over to you.” Bancroft arrived in Paris in July, just as Deane did, and began working for his former tutor.<a href="part0030_split_013.html#ch_13_en_11" id="ch_13_een_11"><sup class="calibre7">11</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>When Franklin arrived later that year, he made Bancroft the secretary of the delegation. What he did not know (and what historians were only to discover a century later by turning up secret documents in London archives) was that Bancroft had recently begun working as a highly active British secret agent.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>The British Secret Service, which was spending close to £200,000 per year by 1777 to gather intelligence, was run by a quick-witted man named William Eden, later Lord Auckland. Overseeing his operations in France was a New Hampshire native, Paul Wentworth, who had moved to London in the 1760s and made money by speculating in stocks and buying land in the West Indies and South America, including the plantation in Guiana where Bancroft had worked as a young medical researcher.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Wentworth in turn recruited Bancroft to be one of his many spies in Paris, and in December 1776 they entered into a formal agreement, using the flimsy code name “Dr. Edward Edwards” for Bancroft. “Dr. Edwards engages to correspond with P. Wentworth to communicate to him whatever may come to his knowledge in the following subjects,” the memo began. It then went on for ten paragraphs to detail the information that Bancroft would provide. This included:</span></p>
<div class="extract">
<p class="extractText"><span>The progress of the treaty with France and of the assistance expected…The same with Spain and of every other court in Europe…The means of obtaining credit, effect and money and the channels and agents used…Franklin’s and Deane’s correspondence with Congress in secret…Descriptions of the ships and cargoes, the time of sailing and the ports bound to…The intelligence that may arrive from America.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="para"><span>Every week, the genial and urbane Bancroft would provide his secret reports by writing between the lines of fake love letters in an invisible ink. The British spymasters had a special chemical wash that could make the writing visible. Bancroft would put the letters in a bottle with a string attached and, at 9:30 every Tuesday evening, drop it in the hollow of a tree near the south terrace of the Tuileries Gardens, where it would be picked up by a messenger from the British embassy. The instructions for the drop were explicit: “The bottle to be sealed and tied by the neck with a common twine, about half a yard in length, the other end of which to be fastened to a peg of wood…the peg into the ground on the west side.” For these services he was initially paid £500 annually, but he performed so well that his stipend rose to £1,000, which was on top of the £1,000 per year he was making as secretary to Franklin’s American delegation. He also made a lot of money on the side by using his inside information to speculate in the stock markets.<a href="part0030_split_013.html#ch_13_en_12" id="ch_13_een_12"><sup class="calibre7">12</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>The hundreds of secret reports that Bancroft sent to the British were filled with sensitive information on the transactions of the Americans in Passy, the discussion they held with French ministers, the schedules of arms shipments being sent to America, and other military matters. He told, for example, of Lafayette’s departure for America in April 1777, listed the French officers accompanying him, and revealed that he was leaving from the Spanish port of San Sebastian and heading “directly to Port Royal South Carolina.” He also warned that the French were “ordering eight to ten ships of war to protect the trade of the colonies near the coast of France and to remove the British cruisers,” and in September 1777 added that “four ships of war are sailed from Toulons to join the Brest fleet.” The following year, in April 1778, he sent word that the French Admiral Count d’Estaing was sailing from Toulon to join the American war effort “and commands a fleet of 17 ships of the line and frigates to destroy or secure the English fleet.” In his letter the next week, he revealed that “the Brest fleet is nearly ready” and noted the possibility that “Count Broglio [a noted French marshal] is to conduct an invasion of England.”<a href="part0030_split_013.html#ch_13_en_13" id="ch_13_een_13"><sup class="calibre7">13</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin and Deane trusted Bancroft so fully that they often had him travel secretly to London to gather intelligence there. He would use these trips to convey some of his most sensitive espionage to the British, and then return with information that seemed valuable but was in fact planted by his spymasters. The British were so intent on keeping his cover that on one trip to London, in March 1777, they pretended to arrest him and briefly imprison him for being an American agent. “Dr. Bancroft is arrested in London for corresponding with and assisting us,” a distraught Deane informed the Congress, and he added, “I feel more for Dr. Bancroft than I can express.” In what seemed a nice miracle, Bancroft was released from prison within weeks and allowed to go back to work in Passy.<a href="part0030_split_013.html#ch_13_en_14" id="ch_13_een_14"><sup class="calibre7">14</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Arthur Lee soon became suspicious of his loyalties. “The notorious character of Dr. Bancroft as a stock-jobber is perfectly known to you,” he wrote Franklin and Adams after learning that he was being sent on yet another secret mission to London in February 1779. “His living in open defiance of decency and religion you are no strangers to; nor to his enmity against me.” More seriously, Lee cited material that indicated Bancroft was a spy: “I have evidence in my possession that makes me consider Dr. Bancroft as a criminal with regard to the United States.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Because he was paranoid about almost everyone, Lee’s suspicions were generally ignored. He was not, however, paranoid enough to realize that his own private secretary was also a spy. Among the papers buried in the British Library are secret transcripts of more than a dozen of Lee’s most sensitive letters as well as a memo informing the head of the spy service that their agent “stole Lee’s journal and copied the information.”<a href="part0030_split_013.html#ch_13_en_15" id="ch_13_een_15"><sup class="calibre7">15</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Through it all, Franklin remained sanguine about the possibility of spies in his midst, even though, shortly after his arrival, he had been warned to be wary by a Philadelphia woman then living in Paris. “You are surrounded with spies who watch your every movement,” she wrote. With an eye more to extolling his virtues than addressing the problem, he sent what became a famous response:</span></p>
<div class="extract">
<p class="extractText"><span>I have long observed one rule which prevents any inconveniences from such practices. It is simply this: to be concerned in no affairs I should blush to have made public, and to do nothing but what spies may see and welcome. When a man’s actions are just and honorable, the more they are known, the more his reputation is increased and established. If I was sure, therefore, that my valet de place was a spy, as he probably is, I think I should probably not discharge him for that, if in other respects I liked him.<a href="part0030_split_013.html#ch_13_en_16" id="ch_13_een_16"><sup class="calibre7">16</sup></a></span></p>
</div>
<p class="para"><span>On one level, Franklin’s answer was naïve, for Bancroft’s treachery led to ships being endangered. (As it turned out, there is no direct evidence that any were consequently lost: Lafayette sailed safely, the British were not able to act quickly enough to block d’Estaing’s passage through the Straits of Gibraltar, and Broglio did not invade England.) On another level, however, Franklin was shrewd, for he would end up using his assumption that there were spies in his midst to play the English off against the French when serious negotiations began.</span></p>
<h3 class="chapterHeadA">Realism and Idealism</h3>
<p class="para"><span>France’s foreign minister, the Comte de Vergennes, was a dowdy professional diplomat, portly and lacking in pretense, but in the words of Susan Mary Alsop, whose book <span class="italic"><span>Yankees at the Court</span></span> is a delightful portrayal of the period, “he was a human and affectionate man and a shrewd judge of character.” He would, indeed, be both affectionate and shrewd in his dealings with Franklin. He was never fully accepted socially at the court of Louis XVI because his wife was bourgeois, but he admired those sensible middle-class qualities in her and presumably found them agreeable in Franklin as well.<a href="part0030_split_013.html#ch_13_en_17" id="ch_13_een_17"><sup class="calibre7">17</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Vergennes was very much a realist in his view of international relations, an outlook he summarized pithily in 1774, when he declared that “the influence of every power is measured by the opinion one has of its intrinsic force.” He was also ardently anti-British, which helped make him sympathetic to the American cause.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>In the spring of 1776, just before Franklin’s arrival, Vergennes had composed for the king a set of proposals that argued in unvarnished terms what France’s policy should be: “England is the natural enemy of France; and she is an avid enemy, ambitious, unjust, brimming with bad faith; the permanent and cherished object of her policy is the humiliation and ruin of France.” America, he said, needed French support to prevail. It was in France’s interest, economically and politically, to try to cripple England by embracing the new nation. He presented these proposals to Louis XVI and his cabinet—which included the comptroller of finances, Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot, who was to become Franklin’s friend and fan—in the gold-gilded Council Chamber of Versailles.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Turgot and the other ministers were worried about France’s tight finances and lack of preparedness, so they urged caution. The king approved a compromise: France would lend some support to America, but only secretly. Vergennes’s letters on the subject, it was decided, would be dictated to his 15-year-old son, whose handwriting would not be identifiable if they fell into the wrong hands.<a href="part0030_split_013.html#ch_13_en_18" id="ch_13_een_18"><sup class="calibre7">18</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin first met Vergennes later that year, on December 28, 1776, at a secret session in Paris, just days after his arrival. With Deane and Lee at his side, Franklin pushed forcefully, and perhaps a bit too quickly, for a French alliance. The foreign minister complimented Franklin on his knowledge and wit, but he made no commitments other than to say that he would consider a memo on the subject if Franklin wished to write one. In his notes that evening, he described Franklin as “intelligent but circumspect,” and in a letter to his ambassador in London he noted, “His conversation is gentle and honest, he appears to be a man of much talent.”<a href="part0030_split_013.html#ch_13_en_19" id="ch_13_een_19"><sup class="calibre7">19</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin accepted Vergennes’s suggestion that he write a memo, and in it he emphasized the realistic balance-of-power calculus that he knew the French minister would appreciate. If France and her ally Spain joined the American cause, Britain would lose her colonies, her possessions in the West Indies, and the “commerce that has rendered her so opulent,” thus reducing her to a “state of weakness and humiliation.” America would be willing to “guarantee in the firmest manner” that France and Spain could keep any of the West Indian islands Britain lost. But if France balked, then America might be “reduced to the necessity of ending the war by an accommodation” with Britain. “Delay may be attended with fatal consequences.”<a href="part0030_split_013.html#ch_13_en_20" id="ch_13_een_20"><sup class="calibre7">20</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>But Franklin realized that appealing to a cold calculus of interests was only part of the equation. Better than most other diplomats in the nation’s history, he understood that America’s strength in world affairs would come from a unique mix that included idealism as well as realism. When woven together, as they would later be in policies ranging from the Monroe Doctrine to the Marshall Plan, they were the warp and woof of a resilient foreign policy. “America’s great historical moments,” writes historian Bernard Bailyn, “have occurred when realism and idealism have been combined, and no one knew this better than Franklin.”<a href="part0030_split_013.html#ch_13_en_21" id="ch_13_een_21"><sup class="calibre7">21</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>As he would prove in France, Franklin not only knew how to play a calculated balance-of-power game like the best practitioner of real-politik, but he also knew how to play with his other hand the rousing chords of America’s exceptionalism, the sense that America stood apart from the rest of the world because of its virtuous nature. Both the hard power that came from its strategic might and the soft power that flowed from the appeal of its ideals and culture would, he realized, be equally important in assuring its influence. In his diplomacy, as in his personal business, he was “a man who believed in the power of reason and the reality of virtue,” declared the writer and mathematician Condorcet, who became one of his best French friends.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>So, after writing Vergennes a memo infused with classic diplomatic realism, Franklin settled down in Passy to pursue the gambit of drawing power from America’s idealism. He arranged for the inspiring documents coming out of America—including the constitution he had written for Pennsylvania—to be translated and published as a way of winning hearts and minds in France and elsewhere. “All Europe is for us,” he wrote the Committee of Secret Correspondence in a letter that explained his rationale for publishing those documents. Then he went on to give a classic formulation of the lure of America’s ideals: “Tyranny is so generally established in the rest of the world that the prospect of an asylum in America for those who love liberty gives general joy, and our cause is esteemed the cause of all mankind.” He ended by echoing the shining “city upon a hill” metaphor used by the great American exceptionalists from John Winthrop to Ronald Reagan. “We are fighting for the dignity and happiness of human nature,” he proclaimed. “Glorious it is for the Americans to be called by Providence to this post of honor.” A few weeks later, he wrote in a similar vein to a Boston friend, concluding, “It is a common observation here that our cause is the cause of all mankind, and that we are fighting for their liberty in defending our own.”<a href="part0030_split_013.html#ch_13_en_22" id="ch_13_een_22"><sup class="calibre7">22</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin’s public diplomacy strategy puzzled Vergennes. “I really do not know what Franklin has come to do here,” he wrote. “At the beginning we thought he had all sorts of projects, but all of a sudden he has shut himself up in sanctuary with the <span class="italic"><span>philosophes.”</span></span> The French minister rejected America’s proposal for an immediate alliance, deflected requests for further meetings, and kept his distance from Franklin for a few months, waiting to see how the war evolved. He did, however, quietly offer some aid: France would make another secret loan to America and allow its ports to be used by American merchant ships.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin also waged his public relations campaign, as he had in England, with some anonymous pieces in the press. The most powerful was a brutal parody, along the lines of “An Edict by the King of Prussia,” that he wrote shortly after his first meeting with Vergennes. It purported to be a letter to the commander of the Hessian troops in America from a German count who got paid a bounty for the death of each of the soldiers he sent over. Because Britain had decided not to pay for any wounded soldiers, only for those who died, the count encouraged his commander to make sure that as many died as possible:</span></p>
<div class="extract">
<p class="extractText"><span>I do not mean by this that you should assassinate them; we should be humane, my dear Baron, but you may insinuate to the surgeons with entire propriety that a crippled man is a reproach to their profession, and that there is no wiser course than to let every one of them die when he ceases to be fit to fight…You will therefore promise promotion to all who expose themselves; you will exhort them to seek glory in the midst of dangers.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="para"><span>He also used his wit to parry the propaganda reports being spread by the British ambassador, Lord Stormont. Asked about one of these reports, Franklin retorted, “It is not a truth; it is only a Stormont.” After that, he and fashionable Paris began using the ambassador’s name as a verb, “stormonter,” a weak pun on the French verb <span class="italic"><span>mentir,</span></span> meaning “to lie.”<a href="part0030_split_013.html#ch_13_en_23" id="ch_13_een_23"><sup class="calibre7">23</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Wild rumors began to circulate about Franklin’s various strategies and schemes in France. One British spy (not Bancroft) reported that Franklin was preparing “a great number of reflecting mirrors” that would be placed on the Calais coast to focus the heat from the sun on the British navy, thus destroying it. That would be followed by an electric shock sent over a cross-channel chain that would disrupt the entire British island. The New Jersey <span class="italic"><span>Gazette</span></span> went further: Franklin was inventing an electrical apparatus that could shift landmasses and a method of using oil that could still the waves in one place while stirring up tempests in another.<a href="part0030_split_013.html#ch_13_en_24" id="ch_13_een_24"><sup class="calibre7">24</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Alas, what he was actually doing was more mundane, such as coping with European supplicants who sought commissions to serve as officers in the American army. His collected letters are clogged with requests, more than four hundred in all, some valiant and others vain. “Not a day passes in which I have not a number of soliciting visits, besides letters,” he complained. “You can have no conception how I am harassed.” There was the mother who offered up three of her flock of sons, the Dutch surgeon who wanted to study bodies that had been blown apart, and the Benedictine monk who promised to pray for America if it would pay off his gambling debts. Franklin’s favorite was a less than effusive recommendation he received from a mother, which began: “Sir, If in your America one knows the secret of how to reform a detestable subject who has been the cross of his family…”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>The case of one such supplicant showed how Franklin’s difficulty in saying no made him an easy mark. An Irishman living in Paris named William Parsons wrote Franklin a pitiful letter describing his unfortunate plight and begging for a commission to join the American army. Franklin did not offer him a recommendation, but he did lend him fifteen guineas, which Parsons then absconded with to England, leaving his poor wife behind. When the wife wrote Franklin a sad letter accusing him of causing her husband to leave, Franklin denied that he had given him any encouragement, wrote off the fifteen-guinea loan, and sent along another guinea to help the wife buy food. For the next three months, she peppered him with pleas for even more relief.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Not all the supplicants were vagabonds. Franklin was able to find, among those seeking commissions, a few great officers to recommend: the Marquis de Lafayette, Baron von Steuben (whose rank in the Prussian army Franklin inflated in his eagerness to get General Washington to take him), and Count Pulaski, a famed Polish fighter who became a heroic brigadeer general for America. Nevertheless, Washington quickly grew testy about the number of aspiring officers Franklin was sending his way. “Our corps being already formed and fully officered,” he wrote, “every new arrival is only a source of embarrassment to Congress and myself and of disappointment and chagrin to the gentlemen who come over.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>So Franklin tried as best he could to reject most of the commission seekers or provide them only with letters that used such phrases as “goes over at his own expense, contrary to my advice.” To cope with the constant flood of requests, or perhaps merely to make fun of them, Franklin even composed a form letter which he had printed up. “The bearer of this, who is going to America, presses me to give him a letter of recommendation, though I know nothing of him, not even his name,” it read. “I must refer you to himself for his character and merits, with which he is certainly better acquainted than I can possibly be.”<a href="part0030_split_013.html#ch_13_en_25" id="ch_13_een_25"><sup class="calibre7">25</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>In September 1777, Franklin and his fellow commissioners went to press Vergennes again for French recognition and, as if to conceal the weakness of their position, to request seven times more aid than had already been given. It was an inauspicious meeting for two reasons. Before it even happened, the spying Bancroft had leaked details of the planned request to Ambassador Stormont, who protested it to Vergennes, who then chided the Americans for being so unguarded. In addition, shortly after the meeting, news arrived that British General Howe had captured Philadelphia.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Howe’s success was a personal blow for Franklin. His house on Market Street was commandeered by a British captain named John André, who, as the Baches took refuge in the countryside, stole his electrical equipment, books, musical instruments, and an elegant portrait of him that had been painted by Benjamin Wilson in 1759. (It was returned from England in 1906 and now hangs on the second floor of the White House.)</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>For America, it threatened to be an even worse blow. Howe was in Philadelphia and General Burgoyne was heading down the Hudson; if and when the two British armies linked, New England would be cut off from the rest of the colonies.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Nonetheless, Franklin kept his equanimity. Told of Howe’s triumph, he replied, “You mistake the matter. Instead of Howe taking Philadelphia, Philadelphia has taken Howe.” On one level it seemed a flippant bon mot. On another, it was a shrewd assessment. If Burgoyne was slowed in his move down the Hudson, and if Howe did not press northward to reinforce him, both could end up isolated.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Arthur Lee wanted to use America’s precarious position to present an ultimatum to the French: either they join America in a military alliance immediately or else America would be forced to reconcile with Britain. “Dr. Franklin was of a different position,” Lee recorded in his journal. “The effect of such a declaration,” Franklin argued, “might make them abandon us in despair or anger.” He felt that America would eventually gain a position that would make it in France’s own interest to want an alliance.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>He was right. Shortly before noon on December 4, a messenger from America galloped into the courtyard of Passy bearing a message from the front. Franklin asked if, as he had already heard, Philadelphia had fallen. “Yes, sir,” said the messenger. Franklin turned his back.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>“But, sir, I have greater news than that,” said the messenger. “General Burgoyne and his whole army are prisoners!” Burgoyne had been defeated at the Battle of Saratoga, and now Howe was indeed isolated.<a href="part0030_split_013.html#ch_13_en_26" id="ch_13_een_26"><sup class="calibre7">26</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>The very dramatic dramatist Beaumarchais, who happened to be at Passy at the time, was eager to use the inside news to speculate in the stock markets; he raced back to Paris at such a high speed that his cabriolet overturned, fracturing his arm. Bancroft also immediately scurried off, heading for London to consult with his spymasters (he would also have speculated, but the news reached London before he did).</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin, far calmer than his odd friends, wrote up a news release filled with little details and large exaggerations: “Mail arrived from Philadelphia at Dr. Franklin’s house in Passy after 34 days. On October 14th General Burgoyne was forced to lay down his arms, 9200 men killed or taken prisoner…General Howe is in Philadelphia, where he is imprisoned. All communication with his fleet is cut off.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Howe was not in fact trapped, nor was America on the verge of victory. Still, the British surrender at Saratoga was a great turning point on the battlefield and—because Franklin knew that power on the battlefield correlated to power at the bargaining table—it was a great turning point for his diplomatic efforts. The note he wrote to Vergennes that afternoon was more restrained than his news release. “We have the honor to acquaint your Excellency,” it began, “with advice of the total reduction of the force under General Burgoyne.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Two days later, Louis XVI from his chamber at Versailles put his royal assent on a gilt-edged paper, prepared for him by Vergennes, that invited the Americans to resubmit their request for a formal alliance. In delivering the message, Vergennes’s secretary added that “it could be done none too soon.”<a href="part0030_split_013.html#ch_13_en_27" id="ch_13_een_27"><sup class="calibre7">27</sup></a></span></p>
<h3 class="chapterHeadA">The Treaties of Friendship<br class="calibre"/>
and Alliance</h3>
<p class="para"><span>After a full year of deflecting requests for an alliance, the French were suddenly impatient as 1777 drew to a close. They were prodded not only by America’s success at Saratoga and the completion of their own naval rearmament program, but also by a new gambit by Franklin. He began to play the French and British off against one another and to let each side discover—and here is where he relied on the spies he knew were in his midst—how eager the other side was for a deal.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin wrote a renewed proposal for a French-American alliance on December 7, Temple delivered it the next day, and within a week the three American commissioners were meeting with Vergennes. The French quickly agreed to full recognition of America and treaties of trade and alliance. There was one caveat: France needed the approval of Spain, as the two countries had pledged in the Bourbon family pact of 1761 to act in concert. Vergennes sent his courier to Madrid and promised the Americans they would have a response in three weeks.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>In the meantime, the British sent to Paris the most trusted envoy they could muster, Paul Wentworth, their able spymaster. At the time, Wentworth was angry with his secret agent Bancroft for sending inside information to his stock speculating partner before sending it to Wentworth, who also was a speculator. King George III, upset by the bad news that his spies were giving him, denounced them all as untrustworthy stock manipulators, but he reluctantly approved Wentworth’s secret peace mission.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Wentworth arrived in Paris in mid-December, just as the Americans were meeting with Vergennes, and sent a missive to Silas Deane that was worthy of a British spy: a gentleman who wished to meet him, it said, could be found the next morning in a coach at a specified place on the road to Passy, or later at an exhibition in the Luxembourg Gallery, or at the public baths on the Seine, where Deane would find a note giving the room number to use. Deane sent a reply worthy of an American: he would be in his office, where he would be happy to see anyone who wanted to come by.<a href="part0030_split_013.html#ch_13_en_28" id="ch_13_een_28"><sup class="calibre7">28</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>At dinner with Deane, Wentworth proposed a plan for reconciliation between Britain and her colonies. America would have its own Congress, would be subject to Parliament only in matters of foreign policy and trade, and all the offensive acts passed since 1763 would be repealed. He also offered personal inducements—knighthoods, peer-ages, jobs, money—to Deane or any American who helped secure such a peace.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin at first refused to meet with Wentworth. But then word came of Spain’s answer to France’s proposal for an alliance with America. Somewhat surprisingly, the Spanish king had rejected the plan and declared that Spain saw no reason to recognize America. It would now be up to France to act alone, if it so chose.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>So, during the first week of 1778, Franklin applied pressure. He let word leak to the press that British emissaries were in town and that they might reach a pact with the Americans if the French did not do so promptly. Such a pact, the stories went, might even include American support for Britain’s efforts to capture France’s islands in the West Indies. He also agreed to meet with Wentworth on January 6, though he made him promise not to offer any personal bribes.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Wentworth’s report back to London was written in the clumsy code that might be expected from an agent who had tried to set up a secret rendezvous in a bathhouse: “I called on 72 [Franklin] yesterday, and found him very busy with his nephew [either Jonathan Williams or, more likely, Temple] who was directed to leave the room, and we remained together two hours before 51 [Deane] joined us, when the conversation ceased.” Wentworth added that he had offered to Franklin an unsigned letter that spoke of the possibility of “unqualified 107,” which was the code he used for independence. “[Franklin] said it was a very interesting, sensible letter,” Wentworth reported, “and applauded the candor, good sense and benevolent spirit of it.” Then he added the kicker: “Pity it did not come a little sooner.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Not quite sure who was spying on whom, Franklin pursued the cleverly naïve approach he had described a year earlier. It was in his interest that the British discover (as they did through their spy Bancroft) how close the Americans were to a deal with France. And it was in his interest that the French discover (as they did through their own constant surveillance of Wentworth) that the Americans were having discussions with a British emissary. Everything he said to Wentworth he was happy to have the French overhear. As Yale historian Jonathan Dull has noted, “The ineptitude of the British government presented Franklin with a chance to play one of his best diplomatic roles: the innocent who may not be so innocent as he pretends.”<a href="part0030_split_013.html#ch_13_en_29" id="ch_13_een_29"><sup class="calibre7">29</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Indeed, Franklin’s meeting with Wentworth seemed to prod the French. Two days later, Vergennes’s secretary called on the Americans. He had only one question: “What is necessary to be done to give such satisfaction to the American commissioners as to engage them not to listen to any proposition from England for a new connection with that country?” Thanks to Franklin’s maneuvers as well as the victory of Saratoga, the French now wanted an alliance as eagerly as America did.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin personally wrote out the answer: “The commissioners have long since proposed a treaty of amity and commerce which is not yet concluded. The immediate conclusion of that treaty will remove the uncertainty they are under with regard to it and give them such a reliance on the friendship of France as to reject firmly all propositions made to them of peace from England which have not for their basis the entire freedom and independence of America.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>That was all the French now needed to hear. Franklin was told that the king would assent to the treaties—one on friendship and trade, the other creating a military alliance—even without the participation of Spain. France made one stipulation: America could not make peace with Britain in the future without France’s consent. And so the treaties of friendship and alliance were won.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>The treaties had an important aspect: they did not violate the idealistic view, held by Franklin and others, that America, in its virgin purity, should avoid becoming entangled in foreign alliances or European spheres of influence. The commercial rights that the Americans granted were mutual, nonexclusive, and permitted a system of open and free trade with other nations. “No monopoly of our trade was granted,” Franklin pointed out in a letter to the Congress. “None are given to France but what we are at liberty to grant to any other nation.”<a href="part0030_split_013.html#ch_13_en_30" id="ch_13_een_30"><sup class="calibre7">30</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>The American commissioners met in Paris on February 5, 1778, for the signing of the treaty. Vergennes’s secretary had a cold, however, so the ceremony was put off for a day. At both gatherings, Franklin appeared without his usual brown coat. Instead, he wore a suit of blue Manchester velvet that was faded and a bit worn. Silas Deane, finding this puzzling, asked why. “To give it a little revenge,” Franklin answered. “I wore this coat the day Wedderburn abused me at Whitehall.” It had been four years since his humiliation in the Cockpit, and he had saved the suit for such an occasion.<a href="part0030_split_013.html#ch_13_en_31" id="ch_13_een_31"><sup class="calibre7">31</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Standing near Franklin, ready to assist, was his supposedly loyal secretary, Edward Bancroft. The British spy took the document, made a copy, hired a special messenger, and got it to the ministers in London within forty-two hours. He had already, two weeks earlier, written coded letters in invisible ink that provided the outline of what the treaty would contain plus the intelligence that a French convoy of three ships and two war frigates was preparing to leave Quiberon to bring the document back to an anxious American Congress. He also sent word that “we have just received a letter from the Prussian ministry to say that the King of Prussia will immediately follow France in acknowledging the independency of America.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Years later, when he was haggling with the British over back pay, Bancroft wrote a secret memo telling the foreign secretary that this was “information for which many individuals here would, for purposes of speculation, have given me more than all that I have received from the government.” In fact, Bancroft had indeed used this information to make money speculating on the markets. He had sent £420 to his stock partner in England, the Philadelphia-born merchant Samuel Wharton, and provided him word of the impending treaties so that it could be used to short stocks. “The bulls in the alley are likely to be left in the lurch,” he wrote in one secret missive to Wharton, using invisible ink. That letter was intercepted by the English spy service, but others made it through to Wharton and also to their other partner, the British banker Thomas Walpole. Bancroft ended up making £1,000 in the transactions.<a href="part0030_split_013.html#ch_13_en_32" id="ch_13_een_32"><sup class="calibre7">32</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Louis XVI made the Franco-American treaties official by receiving the three commissioners at Versailles on March 20. Crowds gathered at the palace gates to catch a glimpse of the famous American, and they shouted “Vive Franklin” as his coach passed through the gold-crested gates.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Among those in the courtyard were, according to Susan Mary Alsop, the “officious porters” who rented out to visitors the ceremonial swords that were generally required for admission to the palace. The other American commissioners each wore one, along with the other items of official court dress. But not Franklin. Seeing no reason to abandon the simple style that had served him well, he dressed in a plain brown suit with his famous spectacles as his only adornment. He did not wear a sword and, when he discovered that the wig he had bought for the occasion did not sit well on his head, decided to forsake it as well. “I should have taken him for a big farmer,” wrote one female observer, “so great was his contrast with the other diplomats, who were all powdered, in full dress, and splashed all over with gold and ribbons.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>His one fashion concession to the occasion was that he did not wear his fur cap but instead carried a hat of pure white under his arm. “Is that white hat a symbol of liberty?” asked Madame du Deffand, the old aristocrat at whose salon Franklin had worn his fur cap. Whether or not he meant it to be, white hats for men were soon in vogue in Paris, as everything else Franklin wore was wont to become.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>When Franklin was ushered into the king’s bedchamber at noon, after the official levee, Louis XVI was in a posture of prayer. “I hope that this will be for the good of both nations,” he said, giving a royal imprimatur to America’s status as an independent nation. On a personal note, he added, “I am very satisfied with your conduct since you arrived in my kingdom.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>After a midafternoon dinner hosted by Vergennes, Franklin had the honor, if not pleasure, of being allowed to stand next to the queen, the famously haughty Marie-Antoinette, as she played at the gambling tables. Alone among the throng at Versailles, she seemed to have little appreciation for the man who, she had been told, had once been “a printer’s foreman.” As she noted dismissively, a man of that background would never have been able to rise so high in Europe. Franklin would have proudly agreed.<a href="part0030_split_013.html#ch_13_en_33" id="ch_13_een_33"><sup class="calibre7">33</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin’s diplomatic triumph would help seal the course of the Revolution. It would also alter the world’s balances of power, not just between France and England, but also—though France certainly did not intend it to—between republicanism and monarchy.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>“Franklin had won,” writes Carl Van Doren, “a diplomatic campaign equal in results to Saratoga.” The Yale historian Edmund Morgan goes even further, calling it “the greatest diplomatic victory the United States has ever achieved.” With the possible exception of the creation of the NATO alliance, that assessment may be true, though it partly points up the paucity of American successes over the years at bargaining tables, whether in Versailles after World War I or in Paris at the end of the Vietnam War. At the very least, it can be said that Franklin’s triumph permitted America the possibility of an outright victory in its war for independence while conceding no lasting entanglements that would encumber it as a new nation.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Before word of the treaty reached Philadelphia, the Congress had been debating whether to consider the new peace offers that had arrived from Britain. Now, after only two days of deliberation, it decided instead to ratify the alliance with France. “You cannot conceive what joy the treaties with France have diffused among all true Americans,” Franklin’s friend Samuel Cooper wrote from Massachusetts.<a href="part0030_split_013.html#ch_13_en_34" id="ch_13_een_34"><sup class="calibre7">34</sup></a></span></p>
