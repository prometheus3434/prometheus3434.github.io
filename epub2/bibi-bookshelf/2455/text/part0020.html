<h3 class="chapterHeadA">JOHN ADAMS</h3>
<p class="para"><span>In April 1778, shortly after the American treaties with France had been signed, John Adams arrived in Paris to replace the recalled Silas Deane as one of the three American commissioners. The French were not thrilled by the switch. “Mr. Deane,” reported Edward Bancroft to his spymasters in London, “is highly esteemed here and his successor J. Adams is much distrusted.” Bancroft reported that Adams was also unhappy. “Adams is heartily disappointed to find everything done and talks of returning.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>When they served together in the Congress, Adams had initially distrusted Franklin, then gone through a blender of emotions: bemusement, resentment, admiration, and jealousy. On their trip to negotiate with Lord Howe on Staten Island (when they shared a bed and open window), he had found Franklin both amusing and annoying. So, when he arrived in Paris, it was probably inevitable that he and Franklin would, as they did, enjoy and suffer a complex mix of disdain and grudging admiration for one another.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Some have found the relationship baffling: Did Adams resent or respect Franklin? Did Franklin find Adams maddening or solid? Did they like or dislike each other? The answer, which is not all that baffling because it is often true of the relationship between two great and strong people, is that they felt all of these conflicting emotions about each other, and more.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>They were both very smart, but otherwise they had quite different personalities. Adams was unbending and outspoken and argumentative, Franklin charming and taciturn and flirtatious. Adams was rigid in his personal morality and lifestyle, Franklin famously playful. Adams learned French by poring over grammar books and memorizing a collection of funeral orations; Franklin (who cared little about the grammar) learned the language by lounging on the pillows of his female friends and writing them amusing little tales. Adams felt comfortable confronting people, whereas Franklin preferred to seduce them, and the same was true of the way they dealt with nations.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Adams, who was 42 when he arrived, was thirty years younger than Franklin and about five years younger than Franklin’s son, William. More sensitive to insults, real and imagined, Adams came to feel more strongly about Franklin than vice versa. At times, he was driven almost to distraction by Franklin’s insouciance and self-indulgence. “He envied—and suspected—people with no rough edges, people who moved easily in the finer circles,” Berkeley historian Robert Middlekauff writes of Adams in his textured study <span class="italic"><span>Benjamin Franklin and His Enemies.</span></span> He was “incapable of the easy gesture, and incapable too of the small hypocrisies that carry other men through life.” David McCullough, in his masterly biography of Adams, is more sympathetic and balanced about him, but he too conveys the rich complexity of his attitudes toward Franklin.<a href="part0030_split_014.html#ch_14_en_1" id="ch_14_een_1"><sup class="calibre7">1</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Most of Adams’s resentments were occasioned by ill-disguised jealousy at being overshadowed. Franklin had “a monopoly of reputation here and an indecency in displaying it,” Adams complained to a friend after a few months in Paris. But in reading some of the unkind things he had to say about Franklin, it is important to note that at one time or another, Adams hurled a few nasty adjectives at just about everyone he met. (For instance, he once described George Washington as a “muttonhead.”) Despite their personal friction, Adams and Franklin were bound together by their shared patriotism and their ardor for America’s independence.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin took Adams under his wing at Passy, enrolled 10-year-old John Quincy Adams at Benny Bache’s boarding school, and took his new colleague on all of his social and cultural rounds, including his grand embrace of Voltaire at the Académie. On Adams’s first day at Passy, Franklin brought him along to dine at the home of Jacques Turgot, the former finance minister, and then on subsequent days to the salons of the various women whose seductive styles entranced Franklin and appalled Adams.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Even more appalling to the puritanical Adams was Franklin’s living and work style. He was disturbed by what he assumed to be the cost of the luxurious accommodations at Passy, then even more upset when he learned that the ambitious Chaumont was charging them no rent. Soon after his arrival, Adams vented in his diary about the difficulty of getting Franklin to focus on work:</span></p>
<div class="extract">
<p class="extractText"><span>I found out that the business of our commission would never be done unless I did it…The life of Dr. Franklin was a scene of continual dissipation…It was late when he breakfasted, and as soon as breakfast was over, a crowd of carriages came to his levee…some philosophers, academicians, and economists; some of his small tribe of humble friends in the literary way whom he employed to translate some of his ancient compositions, such as his Bonhomme Richard and for what I know his Polly Baker, etc., but by far the greater part were women and children, come to have the honor to see the great Franklin, and to have the pleasure of telling stories about his simplicity, his bald head…</span></p>
<p class="extractText"><span>He was invited to dine every day and never declined unless we had invited company to dine with us. I was always invited with him, till I found it necessary to send apologies, that I might have some time to study the French language and do the business of the mission. Mr. Franklin kept a horn book always in his pocket in which he minuted all his invitations to dinner, and Mr. Lee said it was the only thing in which he was punctual…In these agreeable and important occupations and amusements the afternoon and evening was spent, and he came home at all hours from nine to twelve o’clock at night.<a href="part0030_split_014.html#ch_14_en_2" id="ch_14_een_2"><sup class="calibre7">2</sup></a></span></p>
</div>
<p class="para"><span>One of Franklin’s French friends put a more positive spin on his work habits: “He would eat, sleep, work whenever he saw fit, according to his needs, so that there never was a more leisurely man, though he certainly handled a tremendous amount of business.” These two descriptions of Franklin’s style reveal not just differing views about him but also differing views about work. Franklin was always industrious, and in America he famously believed in also giving the <span class="italic"><span>appearance</span></span> of being industrious. But in France, where the appearance of pleasure was more valued, Franklin knew how to adopt the style. As Claude-Anne Lopez notes, “In colonial America it was sinful to look idle, in France it was vulgar to look busy.”<a href="part0030_split_014.html#ch_14_en_3" id="ch_14_een_3"><sup class="calibre7">3</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>One day, a Frenchman asked Adams whether he was surprised that Franklin never attended any religious services. “No,” Adams replied laughing, “because Mr. Franklin has no…” Adams did not finish the sentence for fear of seeming too blasphemous.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>“Mr. Franklin adores only great nature,” said the Frenchman, “which has interested a great many people of both sexes in his favor.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>“Yes,” replied Adams, “all the atheists, deists and libertines, as well as all the philosophers and ladies, are in his train.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>“Yes,” the Frenchman continued, “he is celebrated as the great philosopher and the great legislator of America.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Adams was unable to control his resentment. “He is a great philosopher, but as a legislator of America he has done very little,” he told the Frenchman. “It is universally believed in France, England and all Europe that his electric wand has accomplished all this revolution, but nothing is more groundless…He did not even make the constitution of Pennsylvania, bad as it is.” (Adams, who was not as much of a democrat as Franklin and believed in checks on the power of the people, strongly objected to the unicameral legislature.)<a href="part0030_split_014.html#ch_14_en_4" id="ch_14_een_4"><sup class="calibre7">4</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>After a few years, Franklin would tire of Adams and declare that he was “sometimes, and in some things, absolutely out of his senses.” But for the time being, he found Adams tolerable, at times even admirable. And he was happy to make him part of his social set, despite Adams’s minimal enthusiasm for such frivolities.<a href="part0030_split_014.html#ch_14_en_5" id="ch_14_een_5"><sup class="calibre7">5</sup></a></span></p>
<h3 class="chapterHeadA">VOLTAIRE</h3>
<p class="para"><span>The <span class="italic"><span>philosophes</span></span> of France were, like Franklin, eager to engage in the real world rather than lose themselves in abstruse metaphysics. Their secular version of the Bible was the <span class="italic"><span>Encyclopédie</span></span> compiled by Diderot, which included articles by Turgot on economics, Montesquieu on politics, Rousseau on the arts, Condorcet on sciences, and Helvétius on man. Reigning as their king and god—or perhaps neither, as he was skeptical of both—was Voltaire, a man who contributed anonymously to the <span class="italic"><span>Encyclopédie</span></span> but prominently to the intellectual life of France.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Voltaire and Franklin were, at least in the mind of the French public, soul mates. Both were aging embodiments of the wit and reason of the Enlightenment, playful yet pointed parodists, debunkers of orthodoxy and pretense, disciples of deism, tribunes of tolerance, and apostles of revolution. So it was inevitable not only that the two sages would meet but also that their meetings would, even more than the one between Franklin and the king himself, capture the public imagination.<a href="part0030_split_014.html#ch_14_en_6" id="ch_14_een_6"><sup class="calibre7">6</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>By early 1778, Voltaire was 84 and ailing, and there had even been stories that he had died. (His retort, even better than Mark Twain’s similar one, was that the reports were true, only premature.) In February, Franklin paid a ceremonial visit to his home and asked him to give his blessing to 7-year-old Benny Bache. As twenty awed disciples watched and shed “tears of tenderness,” Voltaire put his hands on the boy’s head and pronounced in English, “God and Liberty.” According to Condorcet, one of the witnesses, he added, “This is the only appropriate benediction for the grandson of Monsieur Franklin.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Some derided the rather histrionic display. One of Paris’s more caustic papers accused them of “playing out a scene” of “puerile adulation,” and when former Massachusetts governor Hutchinson heard of the “God and Liberty” benediction, he remarked that it was “difficult to say which of those words had been most used to bad purposes.” Mainly, however, the encounter was reverentially publicized throughout Europe.<a href="part0030_split_014.html#ch_14_en_7" id="ch_14_een_7"><sup class="calibre7">7</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin and Voltaire staged an even more dramatic meeting at the Académie Royale on April 29 of that year. Franklin was dressed with trademark simplicity: plain coat, no wig, and no adornments other than his spectacles. Voltaire, who would die within a month, was gaunt and frail. The crowd demanded that they give each other a French embrace, an act that evoked, in the words of Condorcet, such “noisy acclamation one would have said it was Solon who embraced Sophocles.” The comparison to the great Greek philosophers, one famous for his laws and the other for his literature, was proclaimed throughout Europe, as eyewitness John Adams reported with his typical mix of awe and resentment:</span></p>
<div class="extract">
<p class="extractText"><span>There was a general cry that M. Voltaire and M. Franklin should be introduced to each other. This was no satisfaction; there must be something more. Neither of our philosophers seemed to divine what was wished or expected; they however took each other by the hand. But this was not enough. The clamor continued until the explanation came out: Il faut s’embrasser à la française. The two aged actors upon this great theater of philosophy and frivolity then embraced each other by hugging one another in their arms and kissing each other’s cheeks, and then the tumult subsided. And the cry immediately spread through the kingdom, and I suppose all over Europe: Qu’il est charmant de voir embrasser Solon et Sophocles.<a href="part0030_split_014.html#ch_14_en_8" id="ch_14_een_8"><sup class="calibre7">8</sup></a></span></p>
</div>
<p class="para"><span>The Académie served as one of Franklin’s bases among the intellectual elite of Paris. Another was a remarkable Masonic lodge known, in honor of the muses, as the Lodge of the Nine Sisters. Freemasonry in France was evolving from being just a set of businessmen’s social clubs, which is what it mainly was in America, and was becoming part of the movement led by the <span class="italic"><span>philosophes</span></span> and other freethinkers who challenged the orthodoxies of both the church and the monarchy. Claude-Adrien Helvétius, a very freethinking <span class="italic"><span>philosophe,</span></span> had first envisioned a superlodge in Paris that would be filled with the greatest writers and artists. When he died, his widow, Madame Helvétius (about whom we will soon hear a lot more), helped fund its creation in1776.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin and Voltaire joined the Lodge of the Nine Sisters in April 1778, the same month as their public meeting at the Académie. The lodge provided Franklin with influential supporters and enjoyable evenings. But it was risky. Both the king and the clerics were wary of the renegade lodge—and of Franklin’s membership in it.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>The controversy surrounding the lodge was heightened when, in November 1778, it held a memorial service for Voltaire, who, on his deathbed a few months earlier, had waved off priests seeking to give him last rites. Some friends, such as Condorcet and Diderot, thought it wise to avoid the ceremony. But Franklin not only attended, he took part in it.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>The hall was draped in black, lit only dimly by candles. There were songs, speeches, and poems attacking the clergy and absolutism in all forms. Voltaire’s niece presented a bust by Houdon. (Houdon, a member, also did a bust of Franklin for the lodge, which is now in the Philadelphia Museum of Art.) Then a flame of light revealed a grand painting of the apotheosis of Voltaire emerging from his tomb to be presented in heaven by the goddesses of Truth and Benevolence. Franklin took the Masonic wreath from his head and solemnly laid it at the foot of the painting. Everyone then adjourned to the banquet room, where the first toast included a tribute to Franklin—“the captive thunder dying at his feet”—and to America.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Louis XVI, though a Mason himself, was annoyed by the spectacle and worked through the other Masonic lodges to have the Nine Sisters expelled. After months of controversy, the situation was resolved when the Nine Sisters reorganized itself and Franklin took over as its Venerable, or Grand Master. During the ensuing years, Franklin would induct many Americans into the lodge, including his grandson Temple, the spy Edward Bancroft, and the naval warrior John Paul Jones. He also helped create from within the lodge a group somewhat akin to his American Philosophical Society, known as the Société Apollonienne.<a href="part0030_split_014.html#ch_14_en_9" id="ch_14_een_9"><sup class="calibre7">9</sup></a></span></p>
<h3 class="chapterHeadA">Madame Brillon</h3>
<p class="para"><span>As fascinating as the freemasons and <span class="italic"><span>philosophes</span></span> were, it was not for his male friends that Franklin was famous in France. Among his many reputations was that of a legendary and lecherous old lover who had many mistresses among the ladies of Paris. The reality, truth be told, was somewhat less titillating. His famed female friends were mistresses only of his mind and soul. Yet that hardly made their relationships less interesting.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>The first of these was with a talented and high-strung neighbor in Passy, Madame Brillon de Jouy, an accomplished musician who was noted for her performances on the harpsichord and the new pianos that were becoming fashionable in France. When she first met Franklin in the spring of 1777, she worried that she had been too shy to make a good impression. So the next day she asked a mutual friend to send her some of the Scottish melodies she knew Franklin loved. “I would try to play them and compose some in the same style!” she wrote. “I do wish to provide the great man with some moments of relaxation from his occupations, and also to have the pleasure of seeing him.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Thus began their intense companionship, which soon became sexually charged and the fodder for much gossip. Adams and others were shocked by what Madame Brillon called her “sweet habit of sitting on your lap” and by stories of their late nights spent together. “I am certain you have been kissing my wife,” her husband once wrote Franklin.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Yet Monsieur Brillon added in his letter, “My dear Doctor, let me kiss you back in return.” Franklin’s relationship with Madame Brillon, like so many of his others with distinguished ladies, was complex and never fully consummated. It was, as Claude-Anne Lopez has ably described, an <span class="italic"><span>amité amoureuse</span></span> in which Franklin had to settle for playing the role of “Cher Papa,” an oddly flirtatious father.<a href="part0030_split_014.html#ch_14_en_10" id="ch_14_een_10"><sup class="calibre7">10</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Madame Brillon, who was 33 when she met Franklin, was buffeted by conflicting passions and variable moods. Her husband, twenty-four years her senior (but fourteen years younger than Franklin), was wealthy, doting, and unfaithful. She had two daughters with beautiful singing voices and lived in one of the most elegant estates in Passy, yet she was prone to fits of depression and self-pity. Although she spoke no English, she and Franklin exchanged more than 130 letters during their eight-year relationship, and she was able not only to enchant him but also to manipulate him.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>She did so by composing and playing music for him, creating a salon around him, and writing him flattering letters in French and in the third person. “It is,” she declared, “a real source of joy for her to think that she can sometimes amuse Mr. Franklin, whom she loves and esteems as he deserves.” When the Americans won the Battle of Saratoga, she composed a triumphal overture entitled “Marche des Insurgents” (which is still sometimes performed) and played it for him in a private concert. They also flirted over the chessboard. “She is still a little miffed,” Madame Brillon teasingly wrote of herself, “about the six games of chess he won so inhumanly and she warns him she will spare nothing to get her revenge.”<a href="part0030_split_014.html#ch_14_en_11" id="ch_14_een_11"><sup class="calibre7">11</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>By March 1778, after months of just music and chess, Franklin was ready for something more. So he shocked her with some of his libertine theology and challenged her to save his soul. “You were kind enough,” she wrote, now comfortable in the first person, “to entrust me with your conversion.” Her propositions were promising, even suggestive. “I know my penitent’s weak spot, I shall tolerate it! As long as he loves God, America, and me above all things, I absolve him of all of his sins, present, past and <span class="italic"><span>future.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Madame Brillon went on to describe the seven cardinal sins, merrily noting that he had conquered well the first six, ranging from pride to sloth. When she got to the seventh, the sin of lust, she became a bit coy: “The seventh—I shall not name it. All great men are tainted with it…You have loved, my dear brother; you have been kind and lovable; you have been loved in return! What is so damnable about that?”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>“She promises to lead me to heaven along a road so delicious,” Franklin exulted in his reply to her. “I am in raptures when I think of being absolved of the <span class="italic"><span>future</span></span> sins.” Turning to the Ten Commandments, he argued that there were actually two others that should be included: to multiply and fill the earth, and to love one another. He had always obeyed those two very well, he argued, and should not that “compensate for my having so often failed to respect one of the ten? I mean the one which forbids us to covet thy neighbor’s wife, a commandment which (I confess) I have consistently violated.”<a href="part0030_split_014.html#ch_14_en_12" id="ch_14_een_12"><sup class="calibre7">12</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Alas, Madame Brillon took that cue to beat a hasty retreat. “I dare not decide the question without consulting that neighbor whose wife you covet,” she wrote, referring to her husband. There was, she explained, a double standard she must obey. “You are a man, I am a woman, and while we might think along the same lines, we must speak and act differently. Perhaps there is no great harm in a man having desires and yielding to them; a woman may have desires, but she must not yield.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Little did she know that her own husband was engaging in this double standard. Once again, it was John Adams who recorded the situation in shocked detail after Franklin took him to dine with “a large company of both sexes” at the Brillons. Madame Brillon struck Adams as “one of the most beautiful women of France,” her husband as “a rough kind of country squire.” Among the crowd was a “very plain and clumsy” woman. “I afterwards learned both from Dr. Franklin and his grandson,” Adams noted, “that this woman was the amie of Mr. Brillon.” He also surmised, this time incorrectly, that Madame Brillon was having an affair with another neighbor. “I was astonished that these people could live together in such apparent friendship and indeed without cutting each other’s throats. But I did not know the world.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>A year later, Madame Brillon found out about her husband’s affair with this “clumsy” young woman, Mademoiselle Jupin, who was the governess of the Brillon girls. She banished the young woman from the house, and then began to fear that she might take a job as Franklin’s housekeeper. After Franklin assured her, in a closed-door session at his office, that he had no intention of hiring the woman, Madame Brillon wrote him a relieved letter. “My soul is calmer, my dear Papa, since it has unburdened itself into yours, since it does not fear anymore that Mlle J——might settle down with you and be your torment.”<a href="part0030_split_014.html#ch_14_en_13" id="ch_14_een_13"><sup class="calibre7">13</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Even before this fit of jealousy, Madame Brillon had begun a crusade to stop Franklin from turning his attentions to other women, despite being unwilling to satisfy his ardor. “When you scatter your friendship, as you have done, my friendship does not diminish, but from now on I shall try to be somewhat sterner to your faults,” she threatened.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>In a forceful yet seductive reply, Franklin argued that she had no right to be so possessive. “You renounce and totally exclude all that might be of the flesh in our affection, allowing me only some kisses, civil and honest, such as you might grant your little cousins,” he chided. “What am I receiving that is so special as to prevent me from giving the same to others?”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>He included in the letter a proposed nine-article treaty of “peace, friendship and love” between the two of them. It began with articles that she would accept, followed by ones declaring pretty much the opposite that he would accept. The former included one saying that “Mr. F. shall come to her whenever she sends for him” and another saying that he would “stay with her as long as she pleases.” His stipulations, on the other hand, included one saying that “he will go away from Madame B’s whenever he pleases,” and another that “he will stay away as long as he pleases.” The final article of the treaty was one on his side: “That he will love any other woman as far as he finds her amiable.” He added, however, that he was “without much hope” that she would agree to this final provision, and in any event “I despair of finding any other woman that I could love with equal tenderness.”<a href="part0030_split_014.html#ch_14_en_14" id="ch_14_een_14"><sup class="calibre7">14</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>In describing his sexual desires, Franklin could be quite salacious. “My poor little boy, whom you ought to have cherished, instead of being fat and jolly like those in your elegant drawings, is thin and starved for want of the nourishment that you inhumanely deny him.” Madame Brillon continued the colloquy by calling him an Epicurean, who “wants a fat chubby love,” and herself a Platonist, who “tries to blunt his little arrows.” In another suggestive letter, he told a fable about a man who refused to lend out his horses to a friend. He was not like that. “You know that I am ready to sacrifice my beautiful big horses.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>After dozens of such sensuous parries and thrusts had passed between them, at least on paper, Madame Brillon ended up rejecting once and for all his desires for a more corporeal love. In return, she also abandoned her attempt to prevent him from seeking it elsewhere. “Platonism may not be the gayest sect, but it is a convenient defense for the fair sex,” she wrote. “Hence, the lady, who finds it congenial, advises the gentleman to fatten up his favorite at other tables than hers, which will always offer too meager a diet for his greedy appetites.”<a href="part0030_split_014.html#ch_14_en_15" id="ch_14_een_15"><sup class="calibre7">15</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>The letter, which concluded with an invitation for tea the next day, did not end their relationship. Instead, it took on another form: Madame Brillon declared that she would henceforth like to play the role of an adoring daughter, and she assigned to him the role of a loving father.</span></p>
<div class="extract">
<p class="extractText"><span>It is to her father that this tender and loving daughter is speaking; I had a father once, the best of men, he was my first, my closest friend. I lost him too soon! You have often asked me: “Couldn’t I take the place of those you regret?” And you have told me about the humane custom of certain savages who adopt their prisoners of war and put them in the place of their own dead relatives. You have taken in my heart the place of that father.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span>Franklin, either out of desire or necessity, formally agreed. “I accept with infinite pleasure, my dear friend, the proposal you make, with such kindness, of adopting me as your father,” he wrote. Then he turned philosophical. It was, as he had said of Benny and Temple, important for him, now that he was separated from his own “affectionate daughter” in Philadelphia, to have always some child with him “to take care of me during my life and tenderly close my eyelids when I must take my last rest.” He would work hard, he promised, to play the role properly. “I love you as a father, with all my heart. It is true that I sometimes suspect that heart of wanting to go further, but I try to conceal it from myself.”<a href="part0030_split_014.html#ch_14_en_16" id="ch_14_een_16"><sup class="calibre7">16</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>The transformation of their relationship evoked from Franklin one of his most wistful and self-revealing little tales, <span class="italic"><span>The Ephemera,</span></span> written to her after a stroll in the garden. (The theme came from an article he had printed in the <span class="italic"><span>Pennsylvania Gazette</span></span> fifty years earlier.) He had happened to overhear, he wrote, a lament by one of the tiny short-lived flies who realized that his seven hours on this planet were nearing an end.</span></p>
<div class="extract">
<p class="extractText"><span>I have seen generations born, flourish and expire. My present friends are the children and grandchildren of the friends of my youth, who are now, alas, no more! And I must soon follow them; for by the course of nature, though still in health, I cannot expect to live above seven or eight minutes longer. What now avails all my toil and labor in amassing honey-dew on this leaf, which I cannot live to enjoy!…</span></p>
<p class="extractText"><span>My Friends would comfort me with the idea of a name they say I shall leave behind me; and they tell me I have lived long enough, to nature and to glory. But what will fame be to an Ephemere who no longer exists?…</span></p>
<p class="extractText"><span>To me, after all my eager pursuits, no solid pleasures now remain, but the reflection of a long life spent in meaning well, the sensible conversation of a few good Lady-Ephemeres, and now and then a kind smile and a tune from the ever-amiable <small class="calibre3">BRILLANTE</small>. [In the original French version, the final words more clearly refer to the recipient: “toujours amiable Brillon.”]<a href="part0030_split_014.html#ch_14_en_17" id="ch_14_een_17"><sup class="calibre7">17</sup></a></span></p>
</div>
<p class="para"><span>Throughout his remaining years in France, and even in letters after his return to America, Franklin would stay emotionally attached to Madame Brillon. Their new arrangement still allowed him such liberties as playing chess with a mutual friend, late into the night, in her bathroom, while she soaked in her tub and watched. But it was, as bathtub chess games go, rather innocent; the tub was covered, as was the style, by a wooden plank. “I’m afraid that we may have made you very uncomfortable by keeping you so long in the bath,” he apologized the next day, adding a wry little promise: “Never again will I consent to start a chess game with the neighbor in your bathing room. Can you forgive me this indiscretion?” She certainly could. “No, my good papa, you did not do me any ill yesterday,” she replied. “I get so much pleasure from seeing you that it made up for the little fatigue of having come out of the bath a little too late.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Having forsaken the possibility of an earthly romance, they amused themselves by promising themselves one in heaven. “I give you my word,” she teased him at one point, “that I will become your wife in paradise on the condition that you will not make too many conquests among the heavenly maidens while you are waiting for me. I want a faithful husband when I take one for eternity.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>More than almost anyone, she could articulate what made him so charming to women, “that gaiety and that gallantry that cause all women to love you, because you love them all.” With both insight and affection, she declared, “You combine the kindest heart with the soundest moral teaching, a lively imagination, and that droll roguishness which shows that the wisest of men allows his wisdom to be perpetually broken against the rocks of femininity.”<a href="part0030_split_014.html#ch_14_en_18" id="ch_14_een_18"><sup class="calibre7">18</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>In the ensuing years, Franklin would help guide Madame Brillon through her bouts of depression, and he would try, as we shall see, to encourage a marriage between Temple and either of her daughters. But increasingly, by 1779, he was turning more of his attention toward another woman, one with an even more fascinating household, who lived in the neighboring village of Auteuil.</span></p>
<h3 class="chapterHeadA">Madame Helvétius</h3>
<p class="para"><span>Anne-Catherine de Ligniville d’Autricourt was born to one of the great aristocratic families of Lorraine, but she was the tenth of twenty children and thus lacked a dowry. So when she was 15 and of marriageable age, she was sent off to a convent. As it turned out, she certainly did not have the temperament for a cloistered life nor, for that matter, the funds. At age 30, her pension ran out and so did she, to Paris, where she was taken in by a kindly aunt who had left her husband, become a novelist, and created a salon filled with bright and slightly bohemian intellectuals.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>There Anne-Catherine’s vivacity and beauty attracted many suitors, most notably the economist Turgot, eight years her junior, who would later become France’s comptroller and a friend of Franklin. Turgot was engaging but not wealthy enough, so she instead married someone more established, Claude-Adrien Helvétius.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Helvétius was one of France’s fifty or so Farmers General, a royal-chartered group with the very lucrative assignment of collecting taxes and holding leases. Once he had made his fortune, Helvétius set out to satisfy his social and intellectual aspirations. So the rich financier married the poor aristocrat and became, as mentioned above, a noted philosopher who helped plan the Nine Sisters Masonic Lodge. His great work, <span class="italic"><span>De l’Esprit</span></span> (1758), was a controversial espousal of godless hedonism, which argued that the love of pleasure motivated human activity. Around him he gathered the stars of the Enlightenment, including Diderot, Condorcet, Hume on his occasional visits from Edinburgh, and Turgot, still in favor though spurned as a suitor.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>When Helvétius died in 1771, five years before Franklin’s arrival, his widow Anne-Catherine, now Madame Helvétius, married off their two daughters to men of their own choosing, gave each of them one of the family chateaux, and bought a rambling farm in Auteuil near Passy. She was lively, outgoing and, as befitted her aristocratic birth but impoverished upbringing, somewhat of a free-spirited bohemian who enjoyed projecting an earthy aura. There is an oft-repeated remark that has been attributed to many but was likely first famously uttered by the writer Fontenelle, who was in his late nineties when he frequented her salon. Beholding Madame Helvétius in one of her more casual states of undress, he proclaimed, “Oh, to be seventy again!”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>At Auteuil she cultivated a free-spirited garden that was devoid of all French formality, a collection of ducks and dogs that formed a noisy and motley menagerie, and a salon that displayed many of the same attributes. Friends brought her rare plants, unusual pets, and provocative ideas, and she nurtured them all at what became jokingly known as “l’Académie d’Auteuil.”<a href="part0030_split_014.html#ch_14_en_19" id="ch_14_een_19"><sup class="calibre7">19</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Living with Madame Helvétius were two priests and one acolyte:</span></p>
<ul class="calibre9">
<li class="calibre8">The Abbé André Morellet, a noted political economist and contributor to the <span class="italic"><span>Encyclopédie,</span></span> in his late forties who had first befriended Franklin in 1772 at the English house party where he played the trick of stilling the waves with his magic cane, and who shared his love for fine wine, song, economic theories, and practical inventions.</li>
<li class="calibre8">The Abbé Martin Lefebvre de la Roche, in his late thirties, a former Benedictine whom (in Morellet’s words) “Helvétius had after a fashion secularized.”</li>
<li class="calibre8">Pierre-Jean-Georges Cabanis, a bachelor poet in his early twenties, who translated Homer, studied medicine, wrote a book on hospitals, and revered Franklin, whose tales and anecdotes he faithfully recorded.</li>
</ul>
<p class="para"><span>“We discoursed of morality, of politics, and of philosophy,” la Roche recalled. “Notre Dame d’Auteuil excited your coquetry, and the Abbé Morellet wrangled over the cream and ushered his arguments to prove what we did not believe.”<a href="part0030_split_014.html#ch_14_en_20" id="ch_14_een_20"><sup class="calibre7">20</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>It was Turgot, still smitten by Madame Helvétius, who first brought Franklin to visit her in 1778, when she was nearly 60 but still both lively and beautiful. Her domestic menagerie, filled with banter and intellectual irreverence, was perfectly tailored to Franklin’s tastes, and shortly thereafter he wrote her a letter in which he described her electromagnetism:</span></p>
<div class="extract">
<p class="extractText"><span>I have in my way been trying to form some hypothesis to account for your having so many friends and of such various kinds. I see that statesmen, philosophers, historians, poets and men of learning of all sorts attach themselves to you as straws to a fine piece of amber…We find in your sweet society that charming benevolence, that amiable attention to oblige, that disposition to please and be pleased, which we do not always find in the society of one another…In your company, we are not only pleased with you, but better pleased with one another and with ourselves.<a href="part0030_split_014.html#ch_14_en_21" id="ch_14_een_21"><sup class="calibre7">21</sup></a></span></p>
</div>
<p class="para"><span>Not surprisingly, John Adams was shocked by both Madame Helvétius and her household when Franklin brought him for a visit. The two abbots, he sniped, “I suppose have as much power to pardon a sin as they have to commit one.” Of the moral “absurdities” at the house he commented, “No kind of republican government can ever exist with such national manners.” His wife, Abigail, was even more horrified when she visited later, and she described Madame Helvétius with a delightfully vicious pen:</span></p>
<div class="extract">
<p class="extractText"><span>Her hair was frizzled; over it she had a small straw hat, with a dirty gauze handkerchief behind…She carried on the chief of the conversation at dinner, frequently locking her hand into the Doctor’s, and sometimes spreading her arms upon the arms of both the gentlemen’s chairs, then throwing her arms carelessly upon the Doctor’s neck…I was highly disgusted, and never wish for an acquaintance with ladies of this cast. After dinner, she threw herself on a settee, where she showed more than her feet. She had a little lap-dog, who was, next to the doctor, her favorite. This she kissed, and when he wet the floor she wiped it up with her shirt.<a href="part0030_split_014.html#ch_14_en_22" id="ch_14_een_22"><sup class="calibre7">22</sup></a></span></p>
</div>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin did more than flirt with Madame Helvétius; by September 1779, he was ardently proposing marriage in a way that was more than half-serious but retained enough ironic detachment to preserve their dignities. “If that Lady likes to pass her days with him, he in turn would like to pass his nights with her,” he wrote through Cabanis, using the third person. “As he has already given her many of his days, though he has so few left to give, she appears ungrateful never to have given him a single one of her nights, which steadily pass as a pure loss, without giving happiness to anyone except Poupon [her dog].”<a href="part0030_split_014.html#ch_14_en_23" id="ch_14_een_23"><sup class="calibre7">23</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>She led him on lightly. “I hoped that after putting such pretty things on paper,” she scrawled, “you would come and tell me some.” He continued his quest in a clever, yet still humorously detached, fashion by composing for her two little tales. The first was written in the voice of the flies living in his apartment. They complain about the dangers they faced from the spiders at Passy and thank her for making him clean out their webs. “There only remains one thing for us to wish,” they conclude. “It is to see both of you forming at last but one ménage.”<a href="part0030_split_014.html#ch_14_en_24" id="ch_14_een_24"><sup class="calibre7">24</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Turgot, now more jealous than amused by Franklin, counseled her to decline his marriage proposals, which she did. Franklin nevertheless renewed his suit with one of his most famous tales, “The Elysian Fields,” in which he recounted a dream about going to heaven and discussing the matter with her late husband and his late wife, who had themselves married. Praising Madame Helvétius’s looks over those of his departed wife, he suggested they take revenge:</span></p>
<div class="extract">
<p class="extractText"><span>Vexed by your barbarous resolution, announced so positively last evening, to remain single all your life in respect to your dear husband, I went home, fell on my bed, and, believing myself dead, found myself in the Elysian Fields…[M. Helvétius] received me with great courtesy, having known me for some time, he said, by the reputation I had there. He asked me a thousand things about the war, and about the present state of religion, liberty, and the government in France. You ask nothing then of your dear friend Madame H——; nevertheless she still loves you excessively and I was at her place but an hour ago.</span></p>
<p class="extractText"><span>Ah! said he, you make me remember my former felicity.—But it is necessary to forget it in order to be happy here. During several of the early years, I thought only of her. Finally I am consoled. I have taken another wife. The most like her that I could find. She is not, it is true, so completely beautiful, but she has as much good sense, a little more of Spirit, and she loves me infinitely. Her continual study is to please me; and she has actually gone to hunt the best Nectar and the best Ambrosia in order to regale me this evening; remain with me and you will see her.</span></p>
<p class="extractText"><span>…At these words the new Madame H——entered with the Nectar: at which instant I recognized her to be Madame F——, my old American friend. I reclaimed to her. But she told me coldly, “I have been your good wife forty-nine years and four months, nearly a half century; be content with that. Here I have formed a new connection, which will endure to eternity.”</span></p>
<p class="extractText"><span>Offended by this refusal of my Eurydice, I suddenly decided to leave these ungrateful spirits, to return to the good earth, to see again the sunshine and you. Here I am! Let us revenge ourselves.<a href="part0030_split_014.html#ch_14_en_25" id="ch_14_een_25"><sup class="calibre7">25</sup></a></span></p>
</div>
<p class="para"><span>Beneath the frivolity lurked a sincere desire—his friends thought so, as did his friendly rival Turgot—yet it was expressed with a flair that made it seem safe and clever. Always uncomfortable with deep emotional bonds, Franklin performed the perfect distancing trick. Instead of conducting his suit in secret, which would have given it a dangerous seriousness, he took it public by publishing the story on his private press a few months later. By doing so, he put his heart out for all to see, and there it could dance safely in the realm between sincerity and self-deprecating playfulness. “Franklin somehow never committed himself wholly in love,” notes Claude-Anne Lopez. “A part of him was always holding back and watching the proceedings with irony.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>It was all too much, both the seriousness and the public playfulness, for Madame Helvétius. She fled in June 1780 to spend the summer in Tours with the hope, according to a letter Turgot wrote a mutual friend, “that she may forget, if possible, all the turmoil that has tormented her.” He added that the vacation was best “not only for her own tranquility, but also to reestablish it in that other head [i.e., Franklin’s] that has agitated so ill-advisedly.”<a href="part0030_split_014.html#ch_14_en_26" id="ch_14_een_26"><sup class="calibre7">26</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>As for Franklin, the deft dance of half-serious flirtations, unrequited though they were, had a rejuvenating effect on his body and spirit. “I do not find that I grow any older,” he wrote a friend that spring. “Being arrived at 70, and considering that by traveling further in the same road I should probably be led to the grave, I stopped short, turned about, and walked back again; which having done these four years, you may now call me 66.”<a href="part0030_split_014.html#ch_14_en_27" id="ch_14_een_27"><sup class="calibre7">27</sup></a></span></p>
<h3 class="chapterHeadA">The Bagatelles</h3>
<p class="para"><span>One product of Franklin’s flirtations at Passy and Auteuil was the collection of fables and tales—such as “The Ephemera,” “The Flies,” and “The Elysian Fields,” mentioned above—that he wrote to amuse his friends. He called them bagatelles, the French term for a sprightly little musical piece, and he published many of them on the private press he installed at Passy. They were similar to little stories he had written in the past, such as “The Trial of Polly Baker,” but the dozen or so written in Passy have a slight French accent to them.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>They have been the subject of much critical fawning. “Franklin’s bagatelles combine delight with moral truth,” declares Alfred Owen Aldridge. “They are among the world’s masterpieces of light literature.” Not exactly. Their value lies more in the glimpse they give into Franklin’s personality than in their literary merit, which is somewhat slight. They are jeux d’esprit, as fun as a five-finger exercise. Most display Franklin’s typical wry self-awareness, though some are a bit heavy-handed in their attempt to teach a moral lesson.<a href="part0030_split_014.html#ch_14_en_28" id="ch_14_een_28"><sup class="calibre7">28</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>The most amusing is “Dialogue between the Gout and Mr. Franklin,” a precursor to the old Alka Seltzer commercial in which a man is berated by his stomach. When he was bedridden by the malady in October 1780, Madame Brillon wrote him a poem, “Le Sage et la Goutte,” that implied that his malady was caused by his love for “one pretty mistress, sometimes two, three, four.” Among the lines:</span></p>
<div class="extract">
<p class="extractVerse"><span><span class="italic"><span>“Moderation, dear Doctor,” said the Gout,</span></span></span></p>
<p class="extractVerse"><span><span class="italic"><span>“Is no virtue for which you stand out.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="extractVerse"><span><span class="italic"><span>You like food, you like ladies’ sweet talk,</span></span></span></p>
<p class="extractVerse"><span><span class="italic"><span>You play chess when you should walk.”</span></span></span></p>
</div>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span>Franklin replied one midnight with a long and rollicking dialogue in which the gout chided him for his indulgences and also, because Franklin liked to be instructive, prescribed a course of exercise and fresh air:</span></p>
<p class="spaceBreak"><span> </span></p>
<p class="para"><span>MR. F.: Eh! oh! eh! What have I done to merit these cruel sufferings?</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>THE GOUT: Many things; you have ate and drank too freely, and too much indulged those legs of yours in their indolence.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>MR. F.: Who is it that accuses me?</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>THE GOUT: It is I, even I, the Gout.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>MR. F.: What! my enemy in person?</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>THE GOUT: No, not your enemy.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>MR. F.: I repeat it, my enemy; for you would not only torment my body to death, but ruin my good name; you reproach me as a glutton and a tippler; now all the world, that knows me, will allow that I am neither the one nor the other.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>THE GOUT: The world may think as it pleases; it is always very complaisant to itself, and sometimes to its friends; but I very well know that the quantity of meat and drink proper for a man who takes a reasonable degree of exercise, would be too much for another who never takes any…</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>If your situation in life is a sedentary one, your amusements, your recreation, at least, should be active. You ought to walk or ride; or, if the weather prevents that, play at billiards. But let us examine your course of life. While the mornings are long, and you have leisure to go abroad, what do you do? Why, instead of gaining an appetite for breakfast by salutary exercise, you amuse yourself with books, pamphlets, or newspapers, which commonly are not worth the reading. Yet you eat an inordinate breakfast, four dishes of tea with cream, and one or two buttered toasts, with slices of hung beef, which I fancy are not things the most easily digested.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Immediately afterwards you sit down to write at your desk, or converse with persons who apply to you on business. Thus the time passes till one, without any kind of bodily exercise. But all this I could pardon, in regard, as you say, to your sedentary condition. But what is your practice after dinner? Walking in the beautiful gardens of those friends with whom you have dined would be the choice of men of sense; yours is to be fixed down to chess, where you are found engaged for two or three hours!</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>…You know M. Brillon’s gardens, and what fine walks they contain; you know the handsome flight of an hundred steps which lead from the terrace above to the lawn below. You have been in the practice of visiting this amiable family twice a week, after dinner, and it is a maxim of your own, that “a man may take as much exercise in walking a mile up and down stairs, as in ten on level ground.” What an opportunity was here for you to have had exercise in both these ways! Did you embrace it, and how often?</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>MR. F.: I cannot immediately answer that question.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>THE GOUT: I will do it for you; not once.<a href="part0030_split_014.html#ch_14_en_29" id="ch_14_een_29"><sup class="calibre7">29</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="spaceBreak"><span> </span></p>
<p class="para"><span>He sent the bagatelle to Madame Brillon along with a letter that, in a cheeky way, rebutted her poem’s contention “that mistresses have had a share in producing this painful malady.” As he pointed out, “When I was a young man and enjoyed more of the favors of the fair sex than I do at present, I had no gout. Hence, if the ladies of Passy had shown more of that Christian charity that I have so often recommended to you in vain, I should not be suffering from the gout right now.” Sex had become, by then, a topic of banter rather than of tension for them. “I will do my best for you, in a spirit of Christian charity,” she wrote back, “but to the exclusion of <span class="italic"><span>your</span></span> brand of Christian charity.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin used his bagatelles as a way to improve his language skills; he would translate them back and forth, show them to friends like the Abbé de la Roche, and then incorporate corrections. He wrote his famous story about paying too much for a whistle as a child, for example, in two columns, the left in French and the right in English, with space in the margins for revisions. Because Madame Brillon spoke no English, Franklin sent her the French versions of his writings, often showing her the corrections others had made.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>She was looser about grammar than about morals. “The corrector of your French spoiled your work,” she said of the edits la Roche made to the gout dialogue. “Leave your works as they are, use words that say things, and laugh at grammarians, who by their purity weaken all your sentences.” For example, Franklin often coined new French words, such as “indulger” (meaning “to indulge”), which his friends would then revise. Madame Brillon, however, found these neologisms charming. “A few purists might quibble with us, because those birds weigh words on a scale of cold erudition,” she wrote, but “since you seem to express yourself more forcefully than a grammarian, my judgment goes in your favor.”<a href="part0030_split_014.html#ch_14_en_30" id="ch_14_een_30"><sup class="calibre7">30</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin found it particularly difficult to master the language’s masculine and feminine distinctions, and he even jokingly put the word “masculines” in the feminine form, and “feminines” in the masculine when complaining about the need to look such things up in the dictionary. “For sixty years now [since age 16], masculine and feminine things—and I am not talking about modes and tenses—have been giving me a lot of trouble,” he noted wryly. “It will make me all the happier to go to paradise where, they say, all such distinctions will be abolished.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>So how good was Franklin’s French? By 1780, he was speaking and writing with great flourish and gusto, though not always with proper pronunciation and grammar. That approach appealed to most of his friends there, particularly the women, but not surprisingly, it offended John Adams. “Dr. Franklin is reported to speak French very well, but I find upon attending to him critically that he does not speak it grammatically,” Adams chided. “He acknowledged to me that he was wholly inattentive to grammar. His pronunciation, too, upon which the French gentlemen and ladies complimented him very highly, and which he seemed to think pretty well, I soon found out was very inaccurate.”<a href="part0030_split_014.html#ch_14_en_31" id="ch_14_een_31"><sup class="calibre7">31</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>The bagatelle that most enchanted his French friends, entitled “Conte,” was a parable about religious tolerance. A French officer who is about to die recounts a dream in which he arrives at the gates of heaven and watches St. Peter ask people about their religion. The first replies that he is a Catholic, and St. Peter says, “Take your place there among the Catholics.” A similar procedure follows for an Anglican and a Quaker. When the officer confesses that he has no religion, St. Peter is indulgent: “You can come in anyway; just find a place for yourself wherever you can.” (Franklin seems to have revised the manuscript a few times to make his point about tolerance clear, and in one version expressed it more forcefully as: “Enter anyway and take any place you wish.”)<a href="part0030_split_014.html#ch_14_en_32" id="ch_14_een_32"><sup class="calibre7">32</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>The tale echoed many of Franklin’s previous light writings advocating religious tolerance. Although Franklin’s belief in a benevolent God was becoming stronger as he grew older, the French intellectuals admired the fact that he did not embrace any religious sect. “Our freethinkers have adroitly sounded him on his religion,” one acquaintance wrote, “and they maintain that they have discovered he is one of their own, that is that he had none at all.”<a href="part0030_split_014.html#ch_14_en_33" id="ch_14_een_33"><sup class="calibre7">33</sup></a></span></p>
<h3 class="chapterHeadA">Chess and Farts</h3>
<p class="para"><span>One of Franklin’s famous passions was chess, as evidenced by the late-night match he played in Madame Brillon’s bathroom. He saw the game as a metaphor for both diplomacy and life, a point that he made explicit in a bagatelle he wrote in 1779 on “The Morals of Chess,” which was based on an essay he had drafted in 1732 for his Philadelphia Junto. “The game of chess is not merely an idle amusement,” he began. “Several very valuable qualities of the mind, useful in the course of human life, are to be acquired or strengthened by it. For life is a kind of chess, in which we have often points to gain and competitors or adversaries to contend with.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Chess, he said, taught foresight, circumspection, caution, and the importance of not being discouraged. There was also an important etiquette to be practiced: never hurry your opponent, do not try to deceive by pretending to have made a bad move, and never gloat in victory: “Moderate your desire of victory over your adversary, and be pleased with the one over yourself.” There were even times when it was prudent to let an opponent retract a bad move: “You may indeed happen to lose the game to your opponent, but you will win what is better, his esteem.”<a href="part0030_split_014.html#ch_14_en_34" id="ch_14_een_34"><sup class="calibre7">34</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>During one of Franklin’s late-night chess matches in Passy, a messenger arrived with an important set of dispatches from America. Franklin waved him off until the game was finished. Another time, he was playing with his equal, the Duchess of Bourbon, who made a move that inadvertently exposed her king. Ignoring the rules of the game, he promptly captured it. “Ah,” said the duchess, “we do not take Kings so.” Replied Franklin in a famous quip: “We do in America.”<a href="part0030_split_014.html#ch_14_en_35" id="ch_14_een_35"><sup class="calibre7">35</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>One night in Passy he was absorbed in a game when the candles flickered out. Refusing to quit, he sent his opponent to find more. The man quickly returned with a surprised look and the news that it was already light outside. Franklin threw open the shutters. “You are right, it is daytime,” he said. “Let’s go to bed.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>The incident was the inspiration for a bagatelle he wrote about his surprise at discovering that the sun rose and poured forth light at 6 in the morning. By this stage in his life, it should be noted, he no longer shared Poor Richard’s belief in being early to bed and early to rise. He declared that this discovery would surprise his readers, “who with me have never seen any signs of sunshine before noon.” This led him to conclude that if people would simply get up much earlier, they could save a lot of money on candles. He even included some pseudo-scientific calculations of what could be saved by this “Economical Project” if during the summer months Parisians would shift their sleeping time seven hours earlier: close to 97 million livres, “an immense sum that the city of Paris might save every year by the economy of using sunshine instead of candles.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin concluded by bestowing the idea on the public without any request for royalty or reward. “I expect only to have the honor of it,” he declared. He ended up with far more honor than he could have imagined: most histories of the invention of Daylight Savings Time credit the idea to this essay by Franklin, even though he wrote it mockingly and did not come up with the idea of actually shifting clocks by an hour during the summer.<a href="part0030_split_014.html#ch_14_en_36" id="ch_14_een_36"><sup class="calibre7">36</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>The essay, which parodied both human habits and scientific treatises, reflected (as did his writings as a youth) the influence of Jonathan Swift. “It was the type of irony Swift would have written in place of ‘A Modest Proposal’ if he had spent five years in the company of Mmes. Helvétius and Brillon,” notes Alfred Owen Aldridge.<a href="part0030_split_014.html#ch_14_en_37" id="ch_14_een_37"><sup class="calibre7">37</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>A similar scientific spoof, even more fun and famous (or perhaps notorious), was the mock proposal he made to the Royal Academy of Brussels that they study the causes and cures of farting. Noting that the academy’s leaders, in soliciting questions to study, claimed to “esteem utility,” he suggested a “serious enquiry” that would be worthy of “this enlightened age”:</span></p>
<div class="extract">
<p class="extractText"><span>It is universally well known that in digesting our common food, there is created or produced in the bowels of human creatures a great quantity of wind. That the permitting this air to escape and mix with the atmosphere is usually offensive to the company from the fetid smell that accompanies it. That all well-bred people therefore, to avoid giving such offense, forcibly restrain the efforts of nature to discharge that wind. That so retained contrary to nature, it not only gives frequently great present pain, but occasions future diseases…</span></p>
<p class="extractText"><span>Were it not for the odiously offensive smell accompanying such escapes, polite people would probably be under no more restraint in discharging such wind in company than they are in spitting or in blowing their noses. My Prize Question therefore should be, To discover some drug wholesome and not disagreeable, to be mixed with our common food or sauces, that shall render the natural discharges of wind from our bodies, not only inoffensive, but agreeable as perfumes.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="para"><span>With a pretense of scientific seriousness, Franklin proceeded to explain how different foods and minerals change the odor of farts. Might not a mineral such as lime work to make the smell pleasant? “This is worth the experiment!” There would be “immortal honor” attached to whoever made the discovery, he argued, for it would be far more “useful [than] those discoveries in science that have heretofore made philosophers famous.” All the works of Aristotle and Newton, he noted, do little to help those plagued by gas. “What comfort can the vortices of Descartes give to a man who has whirlwinds in his bowels!” The invention of a fart perfume would allow hosts to pass wind freely with the comfort that it would give pleasure to their guests. Compared to this luxury, he said with a bad pun, previous discoveries “are, all together, scarcely worth a Fart-hing.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Although he printed this farce privately at his press in Passy, Franklin apparently had qualms and never released it publicly. He did, however, send it to friends, and he noted in particular that it might be of interest to one of them, the famous chemist and gas specialist Joseph Priestley, “who is apt to give himself airs.”<a href="part0030_split_014.html#ch_14_en_38" id="ch_14_een_38"><sup class="calibre7">38</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Yet another delightful essay of mock science was written as a letter to the Abbé Morellet. It celebrated the wonders of wine and the glories of the human elbow:</span></p>
<div class="extract">
<p class="extractText"><span>We hear of the conversion of water into wine at the marriage in Cana as a miracle. But this conversion is, through the goodness of God, made every day before our eyes. Behold the rain which descends from heaven upon our vineyards; there it enters the roots of the vines, to be changed into wine; a constant proof that God loves us, and loves to see us happy. The miracle in question was performed only to hasten the operation.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="para"><span>As for the human elbow, Franklin explained, it was important that it be located at the right place, otherwise it would be hard to drink wine. If Providence had placed the elbow too low on the arm, it would be hard for the forearm to reach the mouth. Likewise, if the elbow had been placed too high, the forearm would overshoot the mouth. “But by the actual situation, we are enabled to drink at our ease, the glass going exactly to the mouth. Let us, then, with glass in hand, adore this benevolent wisdom; let us adore and drink!”<a href="part0030_split_014.html#ch_14_en_39" id="ch_14_een_39"><sup class="calibre7">39</sup></a></span></p>
<h3 class="chapterHeadA">Family Matters</h3>
<p class="para"><span>Where did this new circle of ersatz family members leave Franklin’s actual family? At a distance. His daughter, Sally, who adored him, wrote of her diligence in restoring their house in Philadelphia after the British had withdrawn in May 1778. But whereas the letters from his French lady friends began “Cher Papa,” most of those from his real daughter began more stiffly, with “Dear and honored sir.” His replies, addressed to “Dear Sally” and occasionally “My Dear Child,” often expressed delight about the exploits of his grandchildren. But sometimes even his compliments were freighted with exhortations. “If you knew how happy your letters make me,” he lectured at one point, “I think you would write oftener.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>In early 1779, Sally wrote of the high price of goods in America and how she was busy spinning her own tablecloths. Unfortunately, however, she made the mistake of adding that she had been invited to a ball in honor of General Washington and had sent to France for pins, lace, and feathers so she could look fashionable. “There never was so much dressing and pleasure going on,” she exulted to her father, and she added that she hoped he would send her some accessories so that she could take pride in showing off his taste.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>At the time, Franklin was writing his sweet bagatelles to his French friends and promising Polly Stevenson a pair of diamond earrings if one of his lottery tickets won. But he responded with dismay at Sally’s plea for a few luxuries. “Your sending for long black pins, and lace, and feathers! disgusted me as much as if you had put salt in my strawberries,” he chided. “The spinning, I see, is laid aside, and you are to be dressed for the ball! You seem not to know, my dear daughter, that, of all the dear things in this world, idleness is the dearest.” He sent her some of the items she had requested “that are useful and necessary,” but added a dose of homespun advice, with just a touch of his humor, about the frivolous fineries. “If you wear your cambric ruffles as I do, and take care not to mend the holes, they will come in time to be lace; and feathers, my dear girl, may be had in America from every cock’s tail.”<a href="part0030_split_014.html#ch_14_en_40" id="ch_14_een_40"><sup class="calibre7">40</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Clearly hurt, she replied with a detailed description of how industrious and frugal she was being, and she tried to work back into his graces by sending over some homespun American silk for him to present from her to Queen Marie-Antoinette. Knowing her father’s desire to promote the local silk industry, she noted, “It will show what can be sent from America.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>It was a sweet gesture, with all the elements—industriousness, self-lessness, promotion of American products, gratitude toward France—that should have appealed to Franklin. Alas, the silk was stained by salt water on the way over and, worse yet, her father scoffed at the entire scheme. “I wonder how, having yourself scarce shoes to your feet, it would come into your head to give clothes to a Queen,” he wrote back. “I shall see if the stains can be covered by dyeing it and make summer suits of it for myself, Temple and Benny.” He did, however, end on a kinder and gentler note. “All the things you order will be sent, for you continue to be a good girl, and spin and knit your family stockings.”<a href="part0030_split_014.html#ch_14_en_41" id="ch_14_een_41"><sup class="calibre7">41</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin’s heart proved far softer when it came to news about his grandchildren. In late 1779, Sally had a fourth child and, in hopes of pleasing Franklin, baptized the boy Louis, after the French king. The name was so unusual in America that people had to inquire whether the child was a boy or girl. When her son Willy recited the Lord’s Prayer after a nightmare and addressed it to Hercules, she asked her father for his advice: “Whether it is best to instruct him in a little religion or let him pray a little longer to Hercules?” Franklin replied, with a hint of humor, that she should teach him “to direct his worship more properly, for the deity of Hercules is now quite out of fashion.” Sally complied. A little later she wrote that Willy was learning his Bible well and that he had “an extraordinary memory” for all literature. “He has learned the speech of Anthony over Caesar’s body, which he can scarcely speak without tears.” Her daughter, Elizabeth, she added, was fond of looking at the picture of her grandfather “and has frequently tried to tempt you to walk out of the frame to play with her with a piece of apple pie, the thing of all others she likes best.”<a href="part0030_split_014.html#ch_14_en_42" id="ch_14_een_42"><sup class="calibre7">42</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Sally also found a project that enabled her to earn Franklin’s unvarnished approval. With Washington’s army suffering in tattered uniforms in December 1779, she rallied the women of Philadelphia to raise donations, buy cloth, and sew more than two thousand shirts for the beleaguered troops. “I am very busily employed in cutting out and making shirts…for our brave soldiers,” she reported. When Washington tried to pay cash for even more shirts, the ladies refused it and kept working for free. “I hope you will approve of what we have done,” she wrote, clearly fishing for an expression of praise. Franklin, of course, did approve. He wrote back commending her for her “amor patrie,” and he had an account of her activities published in France.<a href="part0030_split_014.html#ch_14_en_43" id="ch_14_een_43"><sup class="calibre7">43</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Her son Benny also felt the vagaries of Franklin’s affection, even though the boy had been snatched from the bosom of the Bache family to accompany him to Europe. After two years at a boarding school near Passy, where he saw his grandfather but once a week, the quiet 9-year-old was packed off to an academy in Geneva, where he would not see him for more than four years. Despite his love of the French, Franklin felt that a Catholic monarchy was not the best place to educate his grandson, he wrote Sally, “as I intend him for a Presbyterian as well as a Republican.”<a href="part0030_split_014.html#ch_14_en_44" id="ch_14_een_44"><sup class="calibre7">44</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Benny was taken to Geneva by a French diplomat, Philibert Cramer, who was a publisher of Voltaire. Hungry as ever for affection and a father figure, Benny latched on to Cramer, who died suddenly a few months later. So he lived for a while with Cramer’s widow, Catherine, and then was left in the charge of Gabriel Louis de Marignac, a former poet and military officer who ran the academy.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Horribly lonely, Benny begged that his brother William, or his former Passy classmate John Quincy Adams, be sent to join him. At the very least, could he please have a picture of Franklin and some news? Franklin, ever willing to send out his portrait, obliged with one, along with the news of Sally’s success in supplying shirts to Washington’s troops. “Be diligent in your studies that you also may be qualified to do service to your country and be worthy of so good a mother,” he wrote. He also sent word that four of Benny’s former Passy schoolmates had died of smallpox, and he should be thankful he had been inoculated as a child. Yet even his expressions of affection contained a note of contingency. “I shall always love you very much if you continue to be a good boy,” he closed one letter.<a href="part0030_split_014.html#ch_14_en_45" id="ch_14_een_45"><sup class="calibre7">45</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Benny did well his first year and even won the school prize for translating Latin into French. Franklin sent him some money so that he could host the celebration the prizewinner traditionally gave for his classmates. He also asked Polly Stevenson, still in London, to pick out some books for Benny in English, as he was showing signs of losing that language. Polly, knowing how to flatter her friend, picked out a book that included mentions of Franklin.<a href="part0030_split_014.html#ch_14_en_46" id="ch_14_een_46"><sup class="calibre7">46</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>But Benny eventually fell into the funk of a depressed adolescent, perhaps because Franklin never visited, nor did Temple, nor was he brought back to Passy for vacations. He turned shy and indolent, reported Madame Cramer, who continued to keep an eye on him. “He has an excellent heart; he is sensible, reasonable, he is serious, but he has neither gaiety nor vivacity; he is cold, he has few needs, no fantasies.” He didn’t play cards, never got in fights, and showed no signs that he would ever display “great talents” or “passions.” (In this prediction she was wrong, for in later life Benny would become a crusading newspaper editor.) When she reminded Benny that he had won the Latin prize and was clearly capable of being a good student, “he answered coldly that it had been sheer luck,” she wrote Franklin. And when she offered to request for him a larger allowance from his grandfather, he showed no interest.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Benny’s parents became worried, and Richard Bache timidly suggested that perhaps Franklin could find time to go see him. “It would give us pleasure to hear that you had found leisure enough to visit him at Geneva,” Bache wrote, noting that “the journey might conduce to your health.” But it was a tentative suggestion made almost apologetically. “I suspect your time has been more importantly employed,” he quickly added. Madame Cramer, for her part, suggested that at the very least he could write Benny more frequently.<a href="part0030_split_014.html#ch_14_en_47" id="ch_14_een_47"><sup class="calibre7">47</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin did not find time to travel to Geneva, but he did compose for him one of his didactic little essays that proclaimed the virtues of education and diligence. Those who study hard, he wrote, “live comfortably in good houses,” whereas those who are idle and neglect their schoolwork “are poor and dirty and ragged and ignorant and vicious and live in miserable cabins and garrets.” Franklin liked the lesson so much that he made a copy and sent it to Sally, who gushed that “Willy shall get it by heart.” Benny, on the other hand, did not even acknowledge receiving it. So Franklin sent him another copy and ordered him to translate it into French and send it back to assure he understood it.<a href="part0030_split_014.html#ch_14_en_48" id="ch_14_een_48"><sup class="calibre7">48</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Finally, Benny found a friend who brought him out of his torpor: Samuel Johonnot, the grandson of Franklin’s Boston friend the Rev. Samuel Cooper. A “turbulent and factious” lad, he was expelled from the school in Passy, and Franklin arranged to send him to the Geneva academy. He was a smart student, placing first in the class and spurring Benny to come in a respectable third.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Socially, Johonnot’s effect on Benny was even more pronounced. He began to develop more of his family’s rebellious streak. At one point, a cat killed one of their pet guinea pigs, and they resolved to kill a cat, any cat, in revenge, which they did. Benny went to his first dance, which unnerved him so much that he was relieved when a fire across the street brought it to an abrupt end, but then he went to another dance and a third, where he enjoyed himself thoroughly. He wrote to his grandfather that he was now having fun, told of his butterfly-hunting and grape-harvesting expeditions, and was even so bold to hint that he would, after all, like a larger allowance. That, and a watch, “a good golden one.” It would be practical, he assured his grandfather, and he promised to take good care of it.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin responded the way he had to Sally’s request for lace and feathers: “I cannot afford to give gold watches to children,” he wrote. “You should not tease me for expensive things that can be of little or no service to you.” He was also appalled when young Johonnot asked that he and Benny be allowed to come back to Paris. That elicited another stern admonition sent to Johonnot but directed at both boys: “It is time for you to think of establishing a character for manly steadiness.”<a href="part0030_split_014.html#ch_14_en_49" id="ch_14_een_49"><sup class="calibre7">49</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>It was an injunction that should have been addressed to his other grandson, Temple, who had gone to France to continue his own education but had neither enrolled in a college nor taken a course. Temple’s work for the American delegation was competent enough, but he spent most of his time hunting, riding, partying, and chasing women. Hoping to help him settle down with both a dowry and a job, Franklin proposed a marriage between his roguish grandson and the Brillons’ elder daughter, Cunégonde.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>This was nothing new. An incorrigible but never successful matchmaker, Franklin was incessantly trying, usually with ironic half-seriousness, to marry off his children and grandchildren to those of his friends. This time, however, he was wholly serious, indeed earnestly plaintive. His letter making the formal proposal, awkwardly written in a French that was uncorrected by his friends, declared that Madame Brillon was a daughter to him and expressed hope that her daughter would become one as well. He said that Temple, whom the Brillons called Franklinet, had agreed to the proposal, especially after Franklin promised to “remain in France until the end of my days” if the marriage took place. After repeating his desire to have children nearby “to close my eyes when I die,” he went on to extol the virtues of Temple, “who has no vices” and “has what it takes to become, in time, a distinguished man.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Knowing Temple well, the Brillons may not have fully agreed with that assessment. They certainly did not agree to the marriage proposal. The main excuse they gave was that Temple was not a Catholic. That gave Franklin an opening to write, as he had often done before, about the need for religious tolerance and how all religions had at their core the same basic principles. (Among the five he listed in his letter was his own oft-stated religious credo, “The best service to God is doing good to men.”)</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Madame Brillon agreed, in her reply, that “there is only one religion and one morality.” Nevertheless, she and her husband refused to assent to the marriage. “We are obliged to submit to the customs of our country,” she said. M. Brillon was looking to retire from his position as a tax receiver-general and wanted a son-in-law who could succeed him. “This position is the most important of our assets,” she wrote, ignoring that she had frequently complained to Franklin that she was trapped in an arranged marriage made for financial reasons. “It calls for a man who knows the laws and customs of our country, a man of our religion.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin realized that M. Brillon’s objections might be caused by something more than merely Temple’s religion. “There may be other objections he has not communicated to me,” he wrote Madame Brillon, “and I ought not give him trouble.” For his part, Temple embarked on a year-long series of affairs with women high and low, including a French countess and an Italian, until suddenly falling in love, albeit briefly, with the Brillons’ younger daughter, who was only 15. This time M. Brillon seemed ready to approve of the alliance, and even offered a job and dowry, but the fickle Temple had already moved on to other women, including a married mistress who would, eventually, end up making him the third generation of Franklins to bear an illegitimate son.<a href="part0030_split_014.html#ch_14_en_50" id="ch_14_een_50"><sup class="calibre7">50</sup></a></span></p>
