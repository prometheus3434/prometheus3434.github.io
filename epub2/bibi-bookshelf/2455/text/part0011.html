Common Good</h3>
<p class="para"><span>The essence of Franklin is that he was a civic-minded man. He cared more about public behavior than inner piety, and he was more interested in building the City of Man than the City of God. The maxim he had proclaimed on his first trip back from London—“Man is a sociable being”—was reflected not only in his personal collegiality, but also in his belief that benevolence was the binding virtue of society. As Poor Richard put it, “He that drinks his cider alone, let him catch his horse alone.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>This gregarious outlook would lead him, as a twentysomething printer during the 1730s, to use his Junto to launch a variety of community organizations, including a lending library, fire brigade, and night watchmen corps, and later a hospital, militia, and college. “The good men may do separately,” he wrote, “is small compared with what they may do collectively.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin picked up his penchant for forming do-good associations from Cotton Mather and others, but his organizational fervor and galvanizing personality made him the most influential force in instilling this as an enduring part of American life. “Americans of all ages, all stations in life, and all types of dispositions are forever forming associations,” Tocqueville famously marveled. “Hospitals, prisons and schools take shape this way.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Tocqueville came to the conclusion that there was an inherent struggle in America between two opposing impulses: the spirit of rugged individualism versus the conflicting spirit of community and association building. Franklin would have disagreed. A fundamental aspect of Franklin’s life, and of the American society he helped to create, was that individualism and communitarianism, so seemingly contradictory, were interwoven. The frontier attracted barn-raising pioneers who were ruggedly individualistic as well as fiercely supportive of their community. Franklin was the epitome of this admixture of self-reliance and civic involvement, and what he exemplified became part of the American character.<a href="part0030_split_005.html#ch_5_en_1" id="ch_5_een_1"><sup class="calibre7">1</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin’s subscription library, which was the first of its type in America, began when he suggested to his Junto that each member bring books to the clubhouse so that the others could use them. It worked well enough, but money was needed to supplement and care for the collection. So he decided to recruit subscribers who would pay dues for the right to borrow books, most of which would be imported from London.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>The Library Company of Philadelphia was incorporated in 1731, when Franklin was 27. Its motto, written by Franklin, reflected the connection he made between goodness and godliness:<span class="italic"><span>Communiter Bona profundere Deum est</span></span> (To pour forth benefits for the common good is divine).</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Raising funds was not easy. “So few were the readers at the time in Philadelphia and the majority of us so poor that I was not able with great industry to find more than fifty persons, mostly young tradesmen, willing to pay.” In doing so, he learned one of his pragmatic lessons about jealousy and modesty: he found that people were reluctant to support a “proposer of any useful project that might be supposed to raise one’s reputation.” So he put himself “as much as I could out of sight” and gave credit for the idea to his friends. This method worked so well that “I ever after practiced it on such occasions.” People will eventually give you the credit, he noted, if you don’t try to claim it at the time. “The present little sacrifice of your vanity will afterwards be amply repaid.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>The choice of books, recommended by learned Philadelphians such as James Logan, a wealthy fur trader and gentleman scholar whom Franklin got the chance to befriend for this purpose, reflected Franklin’s practical nature. Of the first forty-five bought, there were nine on science, eight on history, and eight on politics; most of the rest were reference books. There were no novels, dramas, poetry, or great literature, other than two classics (Homer and Virgil).</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin spent an hour or two each day reading the books in the library, “and thus repaired in some degree the loss of the learned education my father once intended for me.” His involvement also helped him climb socially: the Junto was composed mainly of poor tradesmen, but the Library Company allowed Franklin to elicit the patronage of some of the more distinguished gentlemen of the town and also begin a lifelong friendship with Peter Collinson, a London merchant who agreed to help acquire the books. Eventually, the idea of local subscription libraries caught on in the rest of the colonies, and so did the benefits. “These libraries have improved the general conversation of the Americans,” Franklin later noted, and “made the common tradesmen and farmers as intelligent as most gentlemen from other countries.” The Library Company thrives to this day. With 500,000 books and 160,000 manuscripts, it remains a significant historical repository and is the oldest cultural institution in the United States.<a href="part0030_split_005.html#ch_5_en_2" id="ch_5_een_2"><sup class="calibre7">2</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin often floated his ideas for civic improvements by writing under a pseudonym for his paper. Using the name Pennsylvanus, he wrote a description of the “brave men” who volunteer to fight fires, and suggested that those who didn’t join them should help bear the expense of ladders, buckets, and pumps. A year later, in an essay he read to the Junto and subsequently published as a letter to his newspaper, he proposed the formation of a fire company. Again taking care not to claim credit, he pretended the letter was written by an old man (who, in declaring that “an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure,” sounded quite like Poor Richard). Philadelphia had a lot of spirited volunteers, he noted, but they lacked “order and method.” They should therefore consider following the example of Boston, he said, and organize into fire-fighting clubs with specific duties. Always a stickler for specifics, Franklin helpfully enumerated these duties in great detail: there should be wardens, who carry “a red staff of five feet,” as well as axmen and hookmen and other specialties.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>“This was much spoken of as a useful piece,” Franklin recalled in his autobiography, so he set about organizing the Union Fire Company, which was incorporated in 1736. He was fastidious in detailing its rules and the fines that would be levied for infractions. This being a Franklin scheme, it included a social component as well; they met for dinner once a month “for a social evening together discussing and communicating such ideas as occurred to us on the subject of fires.” So many people wanted to join that, like the Junto, it spawned sister fire companies around town.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin remained actively involved in the Union Fire Company for years. In 1743, the <span class="italic"><span>Gazette</span></span> carried a little notice: “Lost at the late fire on Water Street, two leather buckets, marked B. Franklin &amp; Co. Whoever brings them to the printer hereof shall be satisfied for their trouble.” Fifty years later, when he returned from Paris after the Revolution, he would gather the four remaining members of the company, along with their leather buckets, for meetings.<a href="part0030_split_005.html#ch_5_en_3" id="ch_5_een_3"><sup class="calibre7">3</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin also sought to improve the town’s ineffective police forces. At the time, the ragtag groups of watchmen were managed by constables who either enlisted neighbors or dunned them a fee to avoid service. This resulted in roaming gangs that made a little money and, Franklin noted, spent most of the night getting drunk. Once again, Franklin suggested a solution in a paper he wrote for his Junto. It proposed that full-time watchmen be funded by a property tax levied according to the value of each home, and it included one of the first arguments in America for progressive taxation. It was unfair, he wrote, that “a poor widow housekeeper, all of whose property to be guarded by the watch did not perhaps exceed the value of fifty pounds, paid as much as the wealthiest merchant, who had thousands of pounds worth of goods in his stores.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Unlike the fire associations, these police patrols were conceived as a government function and needed Assembly approval. Consequently, they did not get formed until 1752, “when the members of our clubs were grown more in influence.” By that time, Franklin was an assemblyman, and he helped draft the detailed legislation on how the watchmen would be organized.<a href="part0030_split_005.html#ch_5_en_4" id="ch_5_een_4"><sup class="calibre7">4</sup></a></span></p>
<h3 class="chapterHeadA">The Freemasons</h3>
<p class="para"><span>One fraternal association, more exalted than the Junto, already existed in Philadelphia, and it seemed perfectly tailored to Franklin’s aspirations: the Grand Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons. Freemasonry, a semisecret fraternal organization based on the ancient rituals and symbols of the stone-cutting guilds, had been founded in London in 1717, and its first Philadelphia lodge cropped up in 1727. Like Franklin, the Freemasons were dedicated to fellowship, civic works, and nonsectarian religious tolerance. They also represented, for Franklin, another step up the social ladder; many of the town’s top merchants and lawyers were Freemasons.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Social mobility was not very common in the eighteenth century. But Franklin proudly made it his mission—indeed, helped it become part of America’s mission—that a tradesman could rise in the world and stand before kings. This was not always easy, and at first he had trouble getting invited to join the Freemasons. So he began printing small, favorable notices about them in his newspaper. When that did not work, he tried a tougher tactic. In December 1730, he ran a long article that purported, based on the papers of a member who had just died, to uncover some of the secrets of the organization, including the fact that most of the secrets were just a hoax.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Within a few weeks, he was invited to join, after which the <span class="italic"><span>Gazette</span></span> retracted its December article and printed some small, flattering notices. Franklin became a faithful Freemason. In 1732, he helped draft the bylaws of the Philadelphia lodge, and two years later became the Grand Master and printed its constitution.<a href="part0030_split_005.html#ch_5_en_5" id="ch_5_een_5"><sup class="calibre7">5</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin’s fealty to the Freemasons embroiled him in a scandal that illustrated his aversion to confronting people. In the summer of 1737, a naïve apprentice named Daniel Rees wanted to join the group. A gang of rowdy acquaintances, not Freemasons, sought to have sport with him and concocted a ritual filled with weird oaths, purgatives, and butt kissing. When they told Franklin of their prank, he laughed and asked for a copy of the fake oaths. A few days later, the hooligans enacted another ceremony, where the hapless Rees was accidentally burned to death by a bowl of flaming brandy. Franklin was not involved, but he was called as a witness in the subsequent manslaughter trial. The newspaper printed by his rival Andrew Bradford, no friend of either Franklin or Freemasonry, charged that Franklin was indirectly responsible because he encouraged the tormentors.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Responding in his own paper, Franklin admitted that he initially laughed at the prank. “But when they came to those circumstances of their giving him a violent purge, leading him to kiss T’s posteriors, and administering him the diabolical oath which R——n read to us, I grew indeed serious.” His credibility, however, was not helped by the fact that he had asked to see the oath and then merrily showed it to friends.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>News of the tragedy, and Franklin’s involvement, was published in anti-Mason papers throughout the colonies, including the Boston <span class="italic"><span>News Ledger,</span></span> and reached his parents. In a letter, he sought to allay his mother’s concerns about the Freemasons. “They are in general a very harmless sort of people,” he wrote, “and have no principles or practices that are inconsistent with religion or good manners.” He did concede, however, that she had a right to be displeased that they did not admit women.<a href="part0030_split_005.html#ch_5_en_6" id="ch_5_een_6"><sup class="calibre7">6</sup></a></span></p>
<h3 class="chapterHeadA">The Great Awakening</h3>
<p class="para"><span>Although he was nondoctrinaire to the point of being little more than a deist, Franklin remained interested in religion, particularly its social effects. During the 1730s, he became enthralled by two preachers, the first an unorthodox freethinker like himself, the other an evangelical revivalist whose fiery conservatism ran counter to most of what Franklin believed.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Samuel Hemphill was a young preacher from Ireland who, in 1734, came to Philadelphia to work as a deputy at the Presbyterian church that Franklin had sporadically visited. More interested in preaching about morality than Calvinist doctrines, Hemphill started drawing large crowds, including a curious Franklin, who found “his sermons pleasing me, as they had little of the dogmatical kind, but inculcated strongly the practice of virtue.” That dearth of dogma did not endear Hemphill to the church elders, however. Jedediah Andrews, the senior minister whose sermons had bored Franklin, complained that Hemphill had been imposed on his church and that “free thinkers, deists, and nothings, getting a scent of him, flocked to him.” Soon Hemphill was brought before the synod on charges of heresy.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>As the trial began, Franklin came to his defense with a deft article purporting to be a dialogue between two local Presbyterians. Mr. S., representing Franklin, listens as Mr. T. complains about how the “new-fangled preacher” talks too much about good works. “I do not love to hear so much of morality; I am sure it will carry no man to heaven.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Mr. S. rejoins that it is what “Christ and his Apostles used to preach.” The Bible makes it clear, he says, that God would have us lead “virtuous, upright and good-doing lives.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>But, asks Mr. T., isn’t faith rather than virtue the path to salvation?</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>“Faith is recommended as a means of producing morality,” Franklin’s mouthpiece Mr. S. replies, adding heretically, “That from such faith alone salvation may be expected appears to me to be neither a Christian doctrine nor a reasonable one.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>As a believer in tolerance, Franklin might have been expected to tolerate the Presbyterians’ imposing whatever doctrine they wanted on their own preachers, but instead he had Mr. S. argue that they should not adhere to their orthodoxies. “No point of faith is so plain as that morality is our duty,” Mr. S. concludes, echoing Franklin’s core philosophy. “A virtuous heretic shall be saved before a wicked Christian.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>It was a typical Franklin effort at persuasion: clever, indirect, and using fabricated characters to make his point. But when the synod unanimously censured and suspended Hemphill, Franklin shed his usual velvet gloves and, as he put it, “became his zealous partisan.” He published an anonymous pamphlet (and, unlike his newspaper dialogue, made sure that the pamphlet remained anonymous) filled with uncharacteristic anger. Not only did he offer detailed theological rebuttals to each of the synod’s charges, but he accused its members of “malice and envy.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Hemphill’s accusers responded with their own pamphlet, which prompted Franklin to write another, even more vitriolic anonymous response that hurled phrases like “bigotry and prejudice” and “pious fraud.” In a subsequent poem, he labeled Hemphill’s critics “Rev. Asses.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>It was a rare violation by Franklin of his Junto rule of avoiding direct contradiction or argumentation, one that was all the more odd because in the past he had cheerily forsaken any claim to care much about doctrinal disputes. His resentment of the entrenched, pious clerical establishment seemed to get the better of his temper.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin’s defense became more difficult when Hemphill was exposed as having plagiarized many of his sermons. Nevertheless, Franklin still stuck by him, explaining later that “I rather approved his giving us good sermons composed by others, than bad ones of his own manufacture, though the latter was the practice of our common teachers.” In the end, Hemphill left town and Franklin quit the Presbyterian congregation for good.<a href="part0030_split_005.html#ch_5_en_7" id="ch_5_een_7"><sup class="calibre7">7</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>The Hemphill affair occurred just as an emotional tide of revivalism, known as the Great Awakening, began sweeping America. Fervent Protestant traditionalists, most notably Jonathan Edwards, were whipping congregants into spiritual frenzies and convulsive conversions with tales of fire and brimstone. As Edwards told his congregation in the most famous of his “terror” sermons, “Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God,” the only thing that kept them from eternal damnation was the inexplicable grace of “the God that holds you over the pit of Hell, much as one holds a spider or some loathsome insect over fire.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Nothing could have been further from Franklin’s theology. Indeed, Edwards and Franklin, the two preeminent Americans of their generation, can be viewed, Carl Van Doren noted, as “symbols of the hostile movements that strove for the mastery of their age.” Edwards and the Great Awakeners sought to recommit America to the anguished spirituality of Puritanism, whereas Franklin sought to bring it into an Enlightenment era that exalted tolerance, individual merit, civic virtue, good deeds, and rationality.<a href="part0030_split_005.html#ch_5_en_8" id="ch_5_een_8"><sup class="calibre7">8</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Thus, it might seem surprising, indeed somewhat odd, that Franklin became enthralled by George Whitefield, the most popular of the Great Awakening’s roving preachers, who arrived in Philadelphia in1739. The English evangelist had been an unhappy soul at Pembroke College, Oxford, and then had a “new birth” into Methodism and later Calvinism. He was doctrinally pure in his insistence that salvation came only through God’s grace, but he was nevertheless deeply involved in charitable work, and his year-long tour through America was to raise money for an orphanage in Georgia. He raised more money than any other cleric of his time for philanthropies, which included schools, libraries, and almshouses across Europe and America. So perhaps it was not so surprising that Franklin took a liking to him though never embraced his theology.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Whitefield’s nightly outdoor revival meetings in Philadelphia (by then America’s largest town, with a population of thirteen thousand) drew huge crowds, and Franklin, sensing a great story, covered him lavishly in the <span class="italic"><span>Pennsylvania Gazette.</span></span> “On Thursday,” he reported, “the Rev. Mr. Whitefield began to preach from the Court House gallery in this city, about six at night, to nearly 6,000 people before him in the street, who stood in an awful silence to hear him.” The crowds grew throughout his week-long visit, and Whitefield returned to the city three more times during his year-long American crusade.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin was awed. He published accounts of Whitefield’s appearances in forty-five weekly issues of his <span class="italic"><span>Gazette,</span></span> and eight times he turned over his entire front page to reprints of the sermons. Franklin recounted in his autobiography, with a wryness born only after years of detachment, the enthusiasm that infected him at the time:</span></p>
<div class="extract">
<p class="extractText"><span>I happened soon after to attend one of his sermons, in the course of which I perceived he intended to finish with a collection, and I silently resolved he should get nothing from me. I had in my pocket a handful of copper money, three or four silver dollars, and five pistoles in gold. As he proceeded I began to soften, and concluded to give the coppers. Another stroke of his oratory made me ashamed of that, and determined me to give the silver; and he finished so admirably, that I emptied my pocket wholly into the collector’s dish, gold and all.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin was also impressed with the transforming effect that Whitefield had on Philadelphia’s citizenry. “Never did the people show so great a willingness to attend sermons,” he reported in the <span class="italic"><span>Gazette.</span></span> “Religion is become the subject of most conversation. No books are in request but those of piety.”<a href="part0030_split_005.html#ch_5_en_9" id="ch_5_een_9"><sup class="calibre7">9</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>The financial implications of that last observation were not lost on Franklin. He met with Whitefield and arranged a deal to be the primary publisher of his sermons and journals, which no doubt added to his zeal to publicize him. After Whitefield’s first visit, Franklin ran an advertisement soliciting orders for a series of Whitefield’s sermons at two shillings a volume. A few months later, he ran a notice that he had received so many orders that those “who have paid or who bring the money in their hands will have the preference.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Thousands were sold, which helped to make Franklin rich and Whitefield famous. Franklin also published ten editions of Whitefield’s journals, each five times more expensive than his almanac, and enlisted a sales force of eleven printers he knew throughout the colonies to make them bestsellers. His sister-in-law Anne Franklin of Newport took a shipment of 250. During 1739–41, more than half the books that Franklin printed were by or about Whitefield.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Some historians have consequently concluded that Franklin’s passion for Whitefield was merely pecuniary. But that is too simplistic. As was often the case, Franklin was able to weave together seamlessly his financial interests with his civic desires and personal enthusiasms. He had a companionable personality, and he was genuinely attracted by Whitefield’s mesmerizing charisma and charitable bent. He invited Whitefield to stay at his home, and when the preacher praised the invitation as being “for Christ’s sake,” Franklin corrected him: “Don’t let me be mistaken; it was not for Christ’s sake, but for your sake.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>In addition, despite their theological differences, Franklin was attracted to Whitefield because he was shaking up the local establishment. Franklin’s long-standing disdain for the religious elite led him to enjoy the discomfort and schisms caused by the intrusion of wildly popular itinerant preachers onto their turf. The tolerant Franklin was pleased that Whitefield’s supporters had erected, with Franklin’s financial support, a large new hall that, among other uses, could provide a pulpit to anyone of any belief, “so that even if the Mufti of Constantinople were to send a missionary to preach Mohammedanism to us, he would find a pulpit at his service.”<a href="part0030_split_005.html#ch_5_en_10" id="ch_5_een_10"><sup class="calibre7">10</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin’s populist delight at the discomfort of the elite was evident in the way he stoked up a controversy about a letter sent to the <span class="italic"><span>Gazette</span></span> by some of the town’s gentry, who wrote that Whitefield had not “met with great success among the better sort of people.” The next week, using the pen name “Obadiah Plainman,” Franklin ridiculed the use of the phrase “the better sort of people” and its implication that Whitefield’s supporters were “the meaner sort, the mob or the rabble.” Mr. Plainman said that he and his friends were proud to call themselves part of the rabble, but they hated it when people who styled themselves “better sort” used such terms and implied that common folks were “a stupid herd.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>A haughty-sounding gentleman named Tom Trueman (or perhaps, given the name, Franklin pretending to be such a gentleman) wrote the next week to William Bradford’s more upscale newspaper to deny that such offense was intended and to accuse Mr. Plainman of fancying himself a leader of the town’s common folks. Franklin, again replying as Mr. Plainman, said he was merely “a poor ordinary” craftsman who, after his labors, “instead of going to the alehouse, I amuse myself with the books of the Library Company.” As such, he rankled at those who proclaimed themselves to be of the better sort and “look on the rest of their fellow subjects with contempt.” Though he was rising in the world in a way that would have allowed him, if he were so inclined, to put on aristocratic airs, Franklin was still allergic to snobbery and proud to be a Plainman defending the middling people.<a href="part0030_split_005.html#ch_5_en_11" id="ch_5_een_11"><sup class="calibre7">11</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>By the fall of 1740, Franklin showed signs of cooling slightly toward Whitefield, though not toward the profits that came from publishing him. The preacher’s efforts to make him a “new born” believer in Calvinist orthodoxy wore thin, and valuable patrons among the Philadelphia gentry began to denounce the <span class="italic"><span>Gazette</span></span>’s ardent flackery. In response to such criticism, Franklin printed an editorial denying (unconvincingly) any bias and restating his philosophy, first propounded in his 1731 “Apology for Printers,” that “when truth has fair play, it will always prevail over falsehood.” But he also included in the issue a letter from a preacher who criticized Whitefield’s “enthusiastic ravings,” and he subsequently published two pamphlets harshly attacking Whitefield as well as one giving Whitefield’s response. The letters in Franklin’s <span class="italic"><span>Gazette,</span></span> 90 percent of which had been favorable to Whitefield in the first nine months of 1740, tipped mostly negative beginning in September, though the pieces written by Franklin remained positive.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Albeit with less ardor, Franklin continued to support Whitefield over the ensuing years, and they maintained an affectionate correspondence until the preacher’s death in 1770. In his autobiography, written after Whitefield died, Franklin added a dose of ironic detachment to his warm recollections. He recounted one sermon he attended where, rather than being moved by Whitefield’s words, Franklin spent the time calculating how far his voice carried. And as for Whitefield’s effect on his spiritual life, Franklin wryly recalled, “He used, indeed, sometimes to pray for my conversion, but never had the satisfaction of believing that his prayers were heard.”<a href="part0030_split_005.html#ch_5_en_12" id="ch_5_een_12"><sup class="calibre7">12</sup></a></span></p>
<h3 class="chapterHeadA">Publishing Wars</h3>
<p class="para"><span>As Franklin’s publishing business grew, his competition with the town’s other printer, Andrew Bradford, intensified. Throughout the early 1730s, they had poked fun at errors in each other’s papers and sparred over such matters as the death of the aspiring young Freemason and the preachings of Samuel Hemphill. There was a political and social basis to the rivalry. The well-born Bradford and his <span class="italic"><span>American Weekly Mercury</span></span> were aligned with Pennsylvania’s “Proprietary faction,” which supported the Penn family and their appointed governors. The leather-aproned Franklin and his <span class="italic"><span>Pennsylvania Gazette</span></span> were more antiestablishment and tended to support the rights of the elected Assembly.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Their politics clashed during the 1733 reelection campaign of the Assembly’s speaker, Andrew Hamilton, an anti-Proprietary leader who had helped Franklin wrest the government printing job from Bradford. Franklin admired Hamilton’s antiaristocratic populism. “He was no friend to power,” Franklin wrote. “He was the poor man’s friend.” Bradford, on the other hand, printed fervent attacks on Hamilton. Among them was an essay “On Infidelity,” which was aimed at Hamilton but designed to wound Franklin as well. Another accused Hamilton of insulting the Penn family and abusing his power as head of the loan office.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin came to Hamilton’s defense with a dignified yet damning rebuttal. Cast as an account of a “Half-Hour’s Conversation” with Hamilton, the piece skewered Bradford for sins ranging from malapropism (using “contemptibly” when he meant “contemptuously”) to hiding behind the cloak of anonymity (“seeing it was commonly agreed to be wrote by nobody, he thought nobody should regard it”). Hamilton comes across as a polite Junto visitor with a touch of Poor Richard. “Throw enough dirt,” he laments, “and some will stick.”<a href="part0030_split_005.html#ch_5_en_13" id="ch_5_een_13"><sup class="calibre7">13</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Hamilton won reelection, and in 1736 he got Franklin chosen as the clerk of the Assembly. Again, public service and private profit were combined. The clerkship, Franklin freely admitted, “gave me a better opportunity of keeping up an interest among the members, which secured to me the business of printing the votes, laws, paper money, and other occasional jobs for the public, that, on the whole, were very profitable.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>It also taught him a useful trick for seducing opponents. After one rich and well-bred member spoke against him, Franklin decided to win him over:</span></p>
<div class="extract">
<p class="extractText"><span>I did not, however, aim at gaining his favor by paying any servile respect to him, but, after some time, took this other method. Having heard that he had in his library a certain very scarce and curious book, I wrote a note to him, expressing my desire of perusing that book, and requesting he would do me the favor of lending it to me for a few days. He sent it immediately, and I returned it in about a week with another note, expressing strongly my sense of the favor. When we next met in the House, he spoke to me (which he had never done before), and with great civility; and he ever after manifested a readiness to serve me on all occasions, so that we became great friends, and our friendship continued to his death. This is another instance of the truth of an old maxim I had learned, which says, “He that has once done you a kindness will be more ready to do you another, than he whom you yourself have obliged.”<a href="part0030_split_005.html#ch_5_en_14" id="ch_5_een_14"><sup class="calibre7">14</sup></a></span></p>
</div>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin’s competition with Bradford had one interesting aspect that might seem unusual but was, then as now, somewhat common. Even as they competed against each other in some areas, like modern media barons they cooperated in others. For example, in 1733, even as they were bitter opponents in the Hamilton election, they formed a joint venture to share the risk of publishing an expensive Psalm book. At Bradford’s suggestion, Franklin handled the printing, Bradford supplied the paper, they split the costs, and each got half of the five hundred copies that were made.<a href="part0030_split_005.html#ch_5_en_15" id="ch_5_een_15"><sup class="calibre7">15</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>In his competition with Bradford, Franklin had one big disadvantage. Bradford was the postmaster of Philadelphia, and he used that position to deny Franklin the right, at least officially, to send his <span class="italic"><span>Gazette</span></span> through the mail. Their ensuing struggle over the issue of open carriage was an early example of the tension that often still exists between those who create content and those who control distribution systems.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>At one point, Franklin got Col. Alexander Spotswood, the postmaster for the colonies, to order Bradford to run an open system that would carry rival papers. But Bradford continued to make it difficult for Franklin’s papers to get carriage, forcing Franklin to bribe the postal riders. Franklin worried not only about the expense but also about the public perception. Because Bradford controlled the Philadelphia post, Franklin wrote, “it was imagined he had better opportunities of obtaining news, [and] his paper was thought a better distributor of advertisements than mine.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin was able to wrest the Philadelphia postmastership away when it was discovered that Bradford had been sloppy in his bookkeeping. Colonel Spotswood, with Franklin’s encouragement, withdrew Bradford’s commission in 1737 and offered the job to Franklin. “I accepted it readily,” Franklin noted, “and found it of great advantage, for though the salary was small, it facilitated the correspondence that improved my newspaper, increased the number demanded, as well as the advertisements to be inserted, so that it came to afford me a very considerable income.” Bradford’s paper declined accordingly.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Instead of retaliating, Franklin allowed Bradford’s <span class="italic"><span>Mercury</span></span> to be carried through the mails along with the <span class="italic"><span>Gazette</span></span> and others—at least initially. In his autobiography, Franklin congratulated himself for being so open. In fact, however, that policy lasted just two years. Because Bradford never settled the accounts from his tenure as Philadelphia postmaster, Spotswood sent Franklin an order to “commence suit against him” and “no longer suffer to be carried by the Post any of his newspapers.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Bradford had to resort to Franklin’s old habit of bribing the postal riders to deliver his papers unofficially. Franklin knew this and tolerated it, just as Bradford had earlier tolerated it for Franklin. But even this partial indulgence by Franklin was not to last.<a href="part0030_split_005.html#ch_5_en_16" id="ch_5_een_16"><sup class="calibre7">16</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>In 1740, he and Bradford became involved in a race to start the first general-interest magazine in America. Franklin came up with the idea, but once again he was betrayed by a confidant, just as happened when he first planned to launch a newspaper. As a wiser Poor Richard would pointedly proclaim in his 1741 almanac, “If you would keep your secret from an enemy, tell it not to a friend.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>This time the turncoat was a lawyer named John Webbe, who had contributed essays to the <span class="italic"><span>Gazette</span></span> and had been chosen by Franklin to file the suit against Bradford that Colonel Spotswood ordered. Franklin described the magazine to Webbe and offered him the job of editor. But Webbe took the idea to Bradford and struck a better deal. On November 6, 1740, Bradford announced plans for <span class="italic"><span>The American Magazine.</span></span> One week later, Franklin published his own plans for <span class="italic"><span>The General Magazine.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>In his announcement, Franklin denounced Webbe’s betrayal. “This Magazine…was long since projected,” he wrote. “It would not, indeed, have been published quite so soon, were it not that a Person, to whom the scheme was communicated in confidence, has thought fit to advertise it in the last <span class="italic"><span>Mercury</span></span>…and reap the Advantage of it wholly to himself.” The ensuing spat led Franklin to ban completely Bradford’s paper from the mails. It also turned the question of postal access into a public issue.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Webbe responded in the <span class="italic"><span>Mercury</span></span> the next week with a sharp counterattack of his own. He particularly objected to one of Franklin’s less endearing traits: his clever and often sly way of implying allegations rather than saying them outright. Franklin’s indirection, “like the slyness of a pickpocket,” was more “dastardly” than the audacity of a “direct liar,” Webbe wrote. “The strokes being oblique and indirect, a man cannot so easily defend himself against them.” Franklin liked to believe that his method of using indirect insinuation was less offensive than confrontational argument, but it sometimes led to even greater enmity and a reputation for crafty deceit.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin did not respond. With an exquisite sense of how to goad Webbe and Bradford, he merely reprinted his original notice in his next issue of the <span class="italic"><span>Gazette,</span></span> including the same allegation of Webbe’s duplicity. This led Webbe to publish another screed in the <span class="italic"><span>Mercury.</span></span> Once again, Franklin showed infuriating restraint: he did not respond, but again reprinted his original notice and allegation.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Webbe escalated the dispute in the December 4 <span class="italic"><span>Mercury</span></span> with an allegation guaranteed to draw a response from Franklin. “Since my first letter,” Webbe wrote, Franklin had “taken upon him to deprive the <span class="italic"><span>Mercury</span></span> of the benefit of the Post.” Franklin replied the following week with a somewhat disingenuous explanation. It had been a year, he said, since Bradford’s <span class="italic"><span>Mercury</span></span> had been barred free use of the mails. This had nothing to do with the dispute over the magazines. Instead, it was at the direct order of Colonel Spotswood. To prove his point, Franklin printed Spotswood’s letter. He said that Bradford and Webbe knew this to be the case, Webbe in particular, as he had been the lawyer Franklin retained to file the suit.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Webbe replied by laying out the history of the postal practices. Yes, he conceded, Spotswood had ordered Franklin to stop carrying Bradford’s paper. But, as Franklin well knew, the riders had continued to carry it unofficially. Moreover, Webbe charged, Franklin himself had confided to people that he permitted this arrangement because it helped assure that Bradford would take care not to print anything too harmful to Franklin. “He had declared,” wrote Webbe, “that as he favored Mr. Bradford by permitting the Postman to distribute his Papers, he had him therefore under his thumb.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>The public debate over postal practices quieted down as each side raced to put out its magazine. In the end, Bradford and Webbe won by three days. Their <span class="italic"><span>American Magazine</span></span> came off the press February 13, 1741, and Franklin’s <span class="italic"><span>General Magazine</span></span> appeared on the 16th.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>The word <span class="italic"><span>magazine,</span></span> as then used, tended to mean a collection drawn from newspapers and other places. The contents of Franklin’s, patterned after London’s ten-year-old <span class="italic"><span>Gentleman’s Magazine,</span></span> were surprisingly dry: official proclamations, reports on government proceedings, discussion of paper currency issues, some smatterings of poetry, and a report about Whitefield’s orphanage.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>The formula failed. Bradford’s magazine folded in three months, Franklin’s in six. No memorable writing from Franklin came out of this process, except a poem he wrote parodying in Irish dialect one of the advertisements in Bradford’s magazine. But the competition to launch the magazine did kindle Franklin’s interest in the power of the postal system.<a href="part0030_split_005.html#ch_5_en_17" id="ch_5_een_17"><sup class="calibre7">17</sup></a></span></p>
<h3 class="chapterHeadA">Sally Franklin</h3>
<p class="para"><span>In 1743, eleven years after the birth of their short-lived son, Franky, the Franklins had a baby girl. Named Sarah after Deborah’s mother, and called Sally, she delighted and charmed both of her parents. When she was 4, Franklin wrote his mother that “your granddaughter is the greatest lover of her book and school of any child I ever knew.” Two years later, he provided a similar report: “Sally grows a fine girl, and is extremely industrious with her needle and delights in her books. She is of most affectionate temper, and perfectly dutiful and obliging, to her parents and to all. Perhaps I flatter myself too much, but I have hopes that she will prove an ingenious, sensible, notable and worthy woman.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin half-seriously pushed the notion that his young daughter might someday marry the son of William Strahan, a London printer who was one of his English correspondents. (In this he was not sexist: he also tried to fix up his son, William, and later his two grandsons with children of his English and French friends, all to no avail.) His descriptions of Sally in his letters to Strahan reveal both his affection for her and the traits he looked for in a daughter. “She discovers daily the seeds and tokens of industry and economy, and in short, of every female virtue,” he wrote when she was 7. Six years later, he wrote, “Sally is indeed a very good girl, affectionate, dutiful, and industrious, has one of the best hearts, and though not a wit, is for one of her years by no means deficient in understanding.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>In one of his childhood debates with John Collins, Franklin had argued in favor of giving girls as well as boys an education, a case he reiterated as Silence Dogood. He practiced these preachings to some degree with Sally, with a predictable emphasis on practical subjects. He made sure she was taught reading, writing, and arithmetic. At her request, he got her French lessons, though her interest soon waned. He also insisted that she learn accounting; when a publishing partner he had in Charleston died and his wife had to take over the business, it reinforced in Franklin the practical view that girls should be taught accounting “as likely to be of more use to them and their children in case of widowhood than either music or dancing.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>When Sally was only 8, Franklin imported from England a large shipment of books for her. The idea was that she would be in charge of selling them at his print shop, but presumably she might also learn something from them herself. Included in the order were three dozen manuals from the Winchester School, four dictionaries, and two dozen copies of a collection of “tales and fables with prudential maxims.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>For the most part, however, Franklin urged Sally to perfect her domestic skills. One day, after watching as she tried unsuccessfully to sew a buttonhole, he arranged for his tailor to come give her lessons. She never got the formal academic training that he provided William. And when he drew up plans to establish an academy in Philadelphia, Sally was 6, but he made no provision for it to educate girls.<a href="part0030_split_005.html#ch_5_en_18" id="ch_5_een_18"><sup class="calibre7">18</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>With only one daughter (and an illegitimate stepson), Deborah’s was an unusually small brood for a robust woman in colonial days; she was one of seven children, Franklin’s father had seventeen in his two marriages, and the average family at the time had about eight. Franklin wrote glowingly of children and had Poor Richard sing praises to the look of a pregnant woman. In satires such as “Polly Baker” and serious essays such as “Observations on the Increase of Mankind,” he extolled the benefits of fecundity. So the Franklins’ paucity of children does not appear to reflect a deliberate decision; instead, it indicated either that they lacked abundant intimacy or found conceiving not always easy, or a combination of both. Whatever the cause, it would eventually give Franklin more leeway to retire from his business early to pursue scientific endeavors and far-flung diplomatic journeys. It also, perhaps, contributed to his lifelong practice of befriending younger people—women in particular—and forging relationships with them as if they were his children.<a href="part0030_split_005.html#ch_5_en_19" id="ch_5_een_19"><sup class="calibre7">19</sup></a></span></p>
<h3 class="chapterHeadA">Polly Baker</h3>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin’s attitudes toward women can be characterized as somewhat enlightened in the context of his time, but only somewhat. What is clear, however, is that he genuinely liked women, enjoyed their company and conversation, and was able to take them seriously as well as flirt with them. During Sally’s early childhood, he wrote two famous essays that, in different ways, amusingly combined his lenient attitude toward unmarried sex with his appreciative attitude toward women.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>“Advice to a Young Man on the Choice of a Mistress,” written in 1745, is now quite famous, but it was suppressed by Franklin’s grandson and other compilers of his papers throughout the nineteenth century as being too indecent to print. Franklin began the little essay by extolling marriage as being “the proper remedy” for sexual urges. But, if his reader “will not take this counsel” and yet still finds “sex inevitable,” he advised that “in all your amours you should prefer old women to young ones.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin then provided a saucy list of eight reasons: because they have more knowledge, they make better conversation; as they lose their looks, they learn a thousand useful services “to maintain their influence over men”; “there is no hazard of children”; they are more discreet; they age from the head down, so even after their face grows wrinkled their lower bodies stay firm, “so that covering all above with a basket, and regarding only what is below the girdle, it is impossible of two women to know an old one from a young one”; it is less sinful to debauch an older woman than a virgin; there is less guilt, because the older woman will be made happy whereas the younger one will be made miserable. Finally, Franklin produces the cheeky kicker to the piece: “Lastly, they are so grateful!!”<a href="part0030_split_005.html#ch_5_en_20" id="ch_5_een_20"><sup class="calibre7">20</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>“The Speech of Polly Baker” is a tale of sex and woe told from a woman’s point of view, a literary device often used by Franklin with a dexterity that displayed his ability to appreciate the other sex. It purports to recount the speech of a young woman on trial for having a fifth illegitimate child. First published in London, it was then frequently reprinted in England and America without people’s realizing that it was fiction. Thirty years would pass before Franklin revealed that he had written it as a hoax.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>The light humor of the piece hides the fact that it is actually a sharp attack on hypocritical customs and unfair attitudes toward women and sex. Polly argues that she has been doing good by obeying God’s injunction to be fruitful and multiply. “I have brought five fine children into the world, at the risk of my life; I have maintained them well by my own industry.” Indeed, she complains, she could have maintained them a little better were it not for the fact that the court kept fining her. “Can it be a crime (in the nature of things I mean) to add to the number of the King’s subjects in a new country that really wants people? I own it, I should think it a praiseworthy rather than a punishable action.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin, who had fathered an illegitimate child but taken responsibility for it, is particularly scathing about the double standard that subjects Polly, but not the men who had sex with her, to humiliation. As Polly says, “I readily consented to the only proposal of marriage that ever was made me, which was when I was a virgin; but too easily confiding in the person’s sincerity that made it, I unhappily lost my own honor by trusting his; for he got me with child, and then forsook me. That very person you all know; he is now become a magistrate of this county.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>By doing her duty to bring children into the world, despite the fact that no one would marry her and despite the public disgrace, she argued that she deserved, “in my humble opinion, instead of a whipping, to have a statue erected to my memory.” The court, Franklin wrote, was so moved by the speech that she was acquitted, and one of the judges married her the next day.<a href="part0030_split_005.html#ch_5_en_21" id="ch_5_een_21"><sup class="calibre7">21</sup></a></span></p>
<h3 class="chapterHeadA">The American Philosophical Society</h3>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin was among the first to view the British settlements in America not only as separate colonies but also as part of a potentially unified nation. That was, in part, because he was far less parochial than most Americans. He had traveled from one colony to another, formed alliances with printers from Rhode Island to South Carolina, and gathered news for his paper and magazine by reading widely other American publications. Now, as the postmaster in Philadelphia, his connections to other colonies were easier, and his curiosity about them grew.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>In a May 1743 circular, “A Proposal for Promoting Useful Knowledge Among the British Plantations in America,” he proposed what was, in effect, an intercolonial Junto, to be called the American Philosophical Society. The idea had been discussed by the naturalist John Bartram, among others, but Franklin had the printing press, the inclination, and the postal contacts to pull it all together. It would be based in Philadelphia and include scientists and thinkers from other cities. They would share their studies by post, and abstracts would be sent to each member four times a year.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>As with the detailed charter he created for the Junto, Franklin was very specific about the type of subjects to be explored, which were, unsurprisingly, more practical than purely theoretical: “newly discovered plants, herbs, trees, roots, their virtues, uses, etc.;…improvements of vegetable juices, such as ciders, wines, etc.; new methods of curing or preventing diseases;…improvements in any branch of mathematics…new arts, trades, and manufactures…surveys, maps and charts…methods of improving the breeds of animals…and all philosophical experiments that let light into the nature of things.” Franklin volunteered to serve as secretary.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>By the spring of 1744 the society began meeting regularly. The pedantic mathematician Thomas Godfrey was a member, indicating that his feud with Franklin over dowries and almanacs was over. One of the most important members was Cadwallader Colden, a scholar and official from New York whom Franklin had met on his travels the year before. They were to become lifelong friends and spur each other’s scientific interests. Their club was not very active at first—Franklin complained that its members were “very idle gentlemen”—but it eventually grew into a learned society that thrives to this day.<a href="part0030_split_005.html#ch_5_en_22" id="ch_5_een_22"><sup class="calibre7">22</sup></a></span></p>
<h3 class="chapterHeadA">The Pennsylvania Militia</h3>
<p class="para"><span>Most of the voluntary associations that Franklin had thus far formed—the Junto, library, philosophical society, even fire squad—had not usurped the core functions of government. (When he came up with a plan for a police patrol, he had suggested that the Assembly enact and control it.) But in 1747, he proposed something that was, though he may not have realized it, far more radical: a military force that would be independent of Pennsylvania’s colonial government.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin’s plan for a volunteer Pennsylvania militia arose because of the feckless response by the colony’s government to the ongoing threats from France and her Indian allies. Ever since 1689, the intermittent wars between Britain and France had been played out in America, with each side enlisting various Indian tribes and thuggish privateers to gain advantage. The latest American installment was known as King George’s War (1744–48), which was an offshoot of Europe’s War of Austrian Succession and a quaint British struggle with Spain known as the War of Jenkins’s Ear (after a British smuggler who had that body part removed by the Spanish). Among those Americans who marched off toward Canada to fight the French and Indians on behalf of the British in 1746 was William Franklin, then perhaps 16 or so, whose father realized it was futile to resist the wanderlust he himself had felt at that age.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>William never saw any action, but the war soon threatened the safety of Philadelphia when French and Spanish privateers began raiding towns along the Delaware River. The Assembly, dominated by pacifist Quakers, dithered and failed to authorize any defenses. Franklin was appalled by the unwillingness of the various groups in the colony—Quakers and Anglicans and Presbyterians, city and country folks—to work together. So in November 1747, he stepped into the breach by writing a vibrant pamphlet entitled “Plain Truth,” signed by “a Tradesman of Philadelphia.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>His description of the havoc that a privateer raid might wreak sounded like a Great Awakening terror sermon:</span></p>
<div class="extract">
<p class="extractText"><span>On the first alarm, terror will spread over all…The man that has a wife and children will find them hanging on his neck, beseeching him with tears to quit the city…Sacking the city will be the first, and burning it, in all probability, the last act of the enemy…Confined to your houses, you will have nothing to trust but the enemy’s mercy…Who can, without the utmost horror, conceive the miseries of the latter when your persons, fortunes, wives and daughters shall be subject to the wanton and unbridled rage, rapine and lust.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="para"><span>With a small pun on the word “Friends,” Franklin first blamed the Quakers of the Assembly: “Should we entreat them to consider, if not as Friends, at least as legislators, that protection is as truly due from the government to the people.” If their pacifist principles prevent them from acting, he said, they should step aside. He then turned on the “great and rich men” of the Proprietary faction, who were refusing to act because of their “envy and resentment” toward the Assembly.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>So who could save the colony? Here came Franklin’s great rallying cry for the new American middle class. “We, the middling people,” he wrote proudly, using the phrase twice in the pamphlet. “The tradesmen, shopkeepers and farmers of this province and city!”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>He then proceeded to spin an image that would end up applying to much of his work over the ensuing years. “At present we are like separate filaments of flax before the thread is formed, without strength because without connection,” he declared. “But Union would make us strong.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Of particular note was his populist insistence that there be no class distinctions. The militia would be organized by geographic area instead of social strata. “This,” he said, “is intended to prevent people’s sorting themselves into companies according to their ranks in life, their quality or station. It is designed to mix the great and the small together…There should be no distinction from circumstance, but all be on the level.” In another radically democratic approach, Franklin proposed that each of the new militia companies elect its own officers rather than have them appointed by the governor or Crown.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin concluded with an offer to draw up proposals for a militia if his plea was well received. It was. “The pamphlet had a sudden and surprising effect,” he later wrote. So, a week later, in an annotated article in his newspaper, he presented his plans for a militia, filled with his typical detailed description of its organization, training, and rules. Even though he was never an avid or effective public orator, he agreed to address a crowd of his fellow middling people at a sail-making loft and then, two days later, spoke to a more upscale audience of “gentlemen, merchants and others” at the New Hall that had been built for Whitefield.<a href="part0030_split_005.html#ch_5_en_23" id="ch_5_een_23"><sup class="calibre7">23</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Soon some ten thousand men from all over the colony had signed up and formed themselves into more than one hundred companies. Franklin’s local company in Philadelphia elected him their colonel, but he declined the post by saying he was “unfit.” Instead, he served as a “common soldier” and regularly took his turn patrolling the batteries he had helped build along the Delaware River banks. He also amused himself by designing an array of insignia and mottos for the various companies.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>To furnish the Militia Association with cannons and equipment, Franklin organized a lottery that raised £3,000. The artillery had to be purchased from New York, and Franklin led a delegation to convince Gov. George Clinton to approve the sale. As Franklin recounted with some amusement:</span></p>
<div class="extract">
<p class="extractText"><span>He at first refused us peremptorily; but at dinner with his council, where there was great drinking of Madeira wine, as the custom of that place then was, he softened by degrees, and said he would lend us six. After a few more bumpers he advanced to ten; and at length he very good-naturedly conceded eighteen. They were fine cannon, eighteen-pounders, with their carriages, which we soon transported and mounted on our battery.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin did not quite realize how radical it was for a private association to take over from the government the right to create and control a military force. His charter, both in its spirit and wording, faintly foreshadowed a declaration that would come three decades later. “Being thus unprotected by the government under which we live,” he wrote, “we do hereby, for our mutual defense and security, and for the security of our wives, children and estates…form ourselves into an Association.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Thomas Penn, the colony’s Proprietor, understood the implications of Franklin’s actions. “This association is founded on a contempt to government,” he wrote the clerk of the governor’s council, “a part little less than treason.” In a subsequent letter, he called Franklin “a sort of tribune of the people,” and lamented: “He is a dangerous man and I should be very glad [if] he inhabited any other country, as I believe him of a very uneasy spirit.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>By the summer of 1748, the threat of war had passed and the Militia Association disbanded, without any attempt by Franklin to capitalize on his new power and popularity. But the lessons he learned stayed with him. He realized that the colonists might have to fend for themselves instead of relying on their British governors, that the powerful elites deserved no deference, and that “we the middling people” of workers and tradesmen should be the proud sinews of the new land. It also reinforced his core belief that people, and perhaps someday colonies, could accomplish more when they joined together rather than remained separate filaments of flax, when they formed unions rather than stood alone.<a href="part0030_split_005.html#ch_5_en_24" id="ch_5_een_24"><sup class="calibre7">24</sup></a></span></p>
<h3 class="chapterHeadA">Retirement</h3>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin’s print shop had by then grown into a successful, vertically integrated media conglomerate. He had a printing press, publishing house, newspaper, an almanac series, and partial control of the postal system. The successful books he had printed ranged from Bibles and psalters to Samuel Richardson’s novel <span class="italic"><span>Pamela,</span></span> a tale whose mix of raciness and moralism probably appealed to him. (Franklin’s 1744 reprint of <span class="italic"><span>Pamela</span></span> was the first novel published in America.) He also had built a network of profitable partnerships and franchises from Newport and New York to Charleston and Antigua. Money flowed in, much of which he invested, quite wisely, in Philadelphia property. “I experienced,” he recalled, “the truth of the observation, that after getting the first £100, it is more easy to get the second.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Accumulating money, however, was not Franklin’s goal. Despite the pecuniary spirit of Poor Richard’s sayings and the penny-saving reputation they later earned Franklin, he did not have the soul of an acquisitive capitalist. “I would rather have it said,” he wrote his mother, “‘He lived usefully,’ than, ‘He died rich.’ ”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>So, in 1748 at age 42—which would turn out to be precisely the midpoint of his life—he retired and turned over the operation of his printing business to his foreman, David Hall. The detailed partnership deal Franklin drew up would leave him rich enough by most people’s standards: it provided him with half of the shop’s profits for the next eighteen years, which would amount to about £650 annually. Back then, when a common clerk made about £25 a year, that was enough to keep him quite comfortable. He saw no reason to keep plying his trade to make even more. Now he would have, he wrote Cadwallader Colden, “leisure to read, study, make experiments, and converse at large with such ingenious and worthy men as are pleased to honor me with their friendship.”<a href="part0030_split_005.html#ch_5_en_25" id="ch_5_een_25"><sup class="calibre7">25</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Up until then, Franklin had proudly considered himself a leather-apron man and common tradesman, devoid and even contemptuous of aristocratic pretenses. Likewise, that is how he would portray himself again in the late 1760s, when his antagonism to British authority grew (and his hopes for high patronage posts were dashed), and that is how he would cast himself in his autobiography, which he began writing in 1771. It was also the role he would play later in life as a revolutionary patriot, fur-capped envoy, and fervent foe of hereditary honors and privileges.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>However, on his retirement, and intermittently over the next decade or so, he would occasionally fancy himself a refined gentleman. In his groundbreaking study <span class="italic"><span>The Radicalism of the American Revolution,</span></span> historian Gordon Wood calls him “one of the most aristocratic of the founding fathers.” That assessment is perhaps a bit too sweeping or stretches the definition of aristocrat, for even during the years right after his retirement Franklin eschewed most elitist pretensions and remained populist in most of his local politics. But his retirement did indeed usher in a period in his life when he had aspirations to be, if not part of the aristocracy, at least, as Wood says, “a gentleman philosopher and public official” with a veneer of “enlightened gentility.”<a href="part0030_split_005.html#ch_5_en_26" id="ch_5_een_26"><sup class="calibre7">26</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin’s ambivalent flirtation with a new social status was captured on canvas when Robert Feke, a popular self-taught painter from Boston, arrived in Philadelphia that year. He produced the earliest known portrait of Franklin (now at Harvard’s Fogg Art Museum), and it shows him garbed as a gentleman with a velvet coat, ruffled shirt, and wig. Yet, compared to Feke’s other subjects that year, Franklin had himself portrayed in a rather simple way, devoid of social ostentation. “He is represented in an almost painfully plain and unpretentious manner,” notes art historian Wayne Craven, an expert on colonial portraiture. “Franklin’s plainness is not accidental: both the portrait painter and his subject would have agreed that this was the most appropriate way to represent a member of colonial mercantile society who was successful, but not actually wealthy.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin was not aspiring, by his retirement, to become merely an idle gentleman of leisure.
