Dale Carnegie, in his book <span class="italic"><span>How to Win Friends and Influence People</span></span>(1937; New York: Pocket Books, 1994), draws on Franklin’s rules for conversation. Carnegie’s first two rules for “How to Win People to Your Way of Thinking” are: “The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it” and “Show respect for the other person’s opinions. Never say, ‘You’re wrong.’ ” In his section on “How to Change People without Giving Offense or Arousing Resentment,” he instructs: “Call attention to people’s mistakes indirectly” and “Ask questions instead of giving direct orders.” Carnegie’s book has sold more than 15 million copies.</span></p>

The first volume of the Papers 1:1xii in 1959 said Deborah was born in Philadelphia in 1708, but that thinking was revised after Francis James Dallett published a paper the following year called “Dr. Franklin’s In-Laws,” which is cited in Papers 8:139. Dallett’s evidence indicates that Deborah was born in 1705 or 1706, maybe in Philadelphia but more likely in Birmingham, from which she emigrated to Philadelphia with her family in about 1711. See Edward James et al., <span class="italic"><span>Notable American Women 1607–1950</span></span> (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1971), 1:663, entry on Deborah Franklin by Leonard Labaree, the initial editor of the Yale Papers. If she did cross the ocean at age 5 or so, it may have caused her lifelong aversion to ever crossing (or even seeing) it again. For a good analysis, see J. A.

<p id="ch_4_en_35" class="endnote"><span><a href="part0010.html#ch_4_een_35">35</a>. Franklin writes in the Autobiography (p. 92) that he was “educated as a Presbyterian,” but the Puritan sect in Boston into which he was baptized in fact became what is now called the Congregational Church. Both Presbyterians and Congregationalists generally follow the doctrines of John Calvin. See Yale Autobiography 145n. For more on Jedediah Andrews, see Richard Webster, <span class="italic"><span>A History of the Presbyterian Church in America, from Its Origin until the Year 1760</span></span> (Philadelphia: J. M. Wilson, 1857), 105–12. For more on Franklin and the Presbyterians, see chapter 5, n. 7.</span></p>

<p id="ch_4_en_37" class="endnote"><span><a href="part0010.html#ch_4_een_37">37</a>. Deism can be an amorphous concept. Despite his qualms about the consequences of unenhanced deism, Franklin did not shy from the word in labeling his beliefs. I use the word, as he did, to describe the Enlightenment-era philosophy that (1) rejects the belief that faith depends on received or revealed religious doctrines; (2) does not emphasize an intimate or passionate spiritual relationship with God or Christ; (3) believes in a rather impersonal Creator who set in motion the universe and all its laws; (4) holds that reason and the study of nature tells us all we can know about the Creator.

<p id="ch_4_en_39" class="endnote"><span><a href="part0010.html#ch_4_een_39">39</a>. Walters 8, 84–86. Walters’s book is the most direct argument that Franklin was not espousing a literal polytheism. The opposite view is expressed in A. Owen Aldridge’s comprehensive <span class="italic"><span>Benjamin Franklin and Nature’s God.</span></span> Read figuratively, Franklin seems to be saying that different denominations and religions each have their own gods: there is the God of the Puritans, who is different from Franklin’s own God, or the God of the Methodists, of the Jews, of the Anabaptists, or, for that matter, of the Hindus, Muslims, and ancient Greeks. These different gods arise because of differing perspectives (producing what Walters calls Franklin’s “theistic perspectivism”). Franklin believed that the idea of a God as Creator and first cause is common to all religions, and thus can be assumed true. But different religions and sects add their own expressions and concepts, none of which we can really know to be true or false, but that lead to the existence of a multiplicity of gods that allow a more personal relationship with their believers. This interpretation com-ports with Franklin’s comment in his essay that these gods can sometimes disappear as times and cultures evolve. “It may be that after many ages, they are changed and others supply their places.”</span></p>

When his beloved sister Jane also conveyed her misgivings about his emphasis on good works rather than prayer, he offered a similar mix of explanation and mild reassurance. “I am so far from thinking that God is not to be worshipped that I have composed and wrote a whole book of devotions for my own use,” he says, and then urges tolerance. “There are some things in your New England doctrines and worship which I do not agree with, but I do not therefore condemn them…I would only have you make me the same allowances.” BF to JM, July 28, 1743.</span></p>

<p class="endnote"><span>The strongest argument that Franklin was a pure exemplar of the Enlightenment is in historian Carl Becker’s masterful essay on him in the <span class="italic"><span>Dictionary of American Biography</span></span> (New York: Scribner’s, 1933), in which he called Franklin “a true child of the Enlightenment, not indeed of the school of Rousseau, but of Defoe and Pope and Swift, of Fontenelle and Montesquieu and Voltaire. He spoke their language, although with a homely accent…He accepted without question all the characteristic ideas [of the Enlightenment]: its healthy, clarifying skepticism; its passion for freedom and its humane sympathies; its preoccupation with the world that is evident to the senses; its profound faith in common sense, in the efficacy of Reason for the solution of human problems and the advancement of human welfare.” See also Stuart Sherman, “Franklin and the Age of Enlightenment,” in Sanford.</span></p>
