<h3 class="chapterHeadA">The Academy and the Hospital</h3>
<p class="para"><span>The ingenious lad who did not get to go to Harvard, who skewered that college’s pretensions with ill-disguised envy as a teenage essayist, and whose thirst for knowledge had made him the best self-taught writer and scientist of his times had for years nurtured the dream of starting a college of his own. He had discussed the idea in his Junto back in 1743, and after his retirement he became further motivated by the joy he found in science and reading. So in 1749 he published a pamphlet on “Proposals Relating to the Education of Youth in Pennsylvania” that described, with his usual indulgence in detail, why an academy was needed, what it should teach, and how the funds might be raised.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>This was not to be a religiously affiliated, elite bastion like the four colleges (Harvard, William &amp; Mary, Yale, and Princeton) that already existed in the colonies. The focus, as to be expected from Franklin, would be on practical instruction, such as writing, arithmetic, accounting, oratory, history, and business skills, with “regard being had to the several professions for which they are intended.” Earthly virtues should be instilled; students would live “plainly, temperately and frugally” and be “frequently exercised in running, leaping, wrestling and swimming.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin’s plan was that of an educational reformer taking on the rigid classicists. The new academy should not, he felt, train scholars merely to glorify God or to seek learning for its own sake. Instead, what should be cultivated was “an inclination joined with an ability to serve mankind, one’s country, friends and family.” That, Franklin declared in conclusion, “should indeed be the great <span class="italic"><span>aim</span></span> and <span class="italic"><span>end</span></span> of all learning.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>The pamphlet was crammed with footnotes citing ancient scholars and his own experience on everything from swimming to writing style. Like any good Enlightenment thinker, Franklin loved order and precise procedures. He had displayed this penchant by outlining, in the most minute detail imaginable, his rules for running the Junto, Masonic lodge, library, American Philosophical Society, fire corps, constable patrol, and militia. His proposal for the academy was an extreme example, crammed with exhaustive procedures on the best ways to teach everything from pronunciation to military history.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin quickly raised £2,000 in donations (though not the £5,000 he recalled in his autobiography), drew up a constitution that was as detailed as his original proposal, and was elected president of the board. He also happened to be on the board of the Great Hall that had been built for the Rev. Whitefield, which had fallen into disuse as religious revivalism waned. He was thus able to negotiate a deal to have the new academy take over the building, divide it into floors and classrooms, and leave some space available for visiting preachers and a free school for poor children.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>The academy opened in January 1751 as the first nonsectarian college in America (by 1791 it came to be known as the University of Pennsylvania). Franklin’s reformist instincts were thwarted at times. Most of the trustees were from the wealthy Anglican establishment, and they voted over his objection to choose as the school’s rector the Latin rather than English master. William Smith, a flighty minister from Scotland whom Franklin had befriended, was made the provost, but he and Franklin soon had a bitter falling-out over politics. Nonetheless, Franklin remained a trustee for the rest of his life and considered the college one of his proudest achievements.<a href="part0030_split_007.html#ch_7_en_1" id="ch_7_een_1"><sup class="calibre7">1</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Soon after the college opened, Franklin moved on to his next project, raising money for a hospital. The public appeal he published in the <span class="italic"><span>Gazette,</span></span> which vividly described the moral duty people have to help the sick, contained the typical Franklin ringing refrain: “The good particular men may do separately in relieving the sick is small compared with what they may do collectively.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Raising money was difficult, so he concocted a clever scheme: he got the Assembly to agree that, if £2,000 could be raised privately, it would be matched by £2,000 from the public purse. The plan, Franklin recalled, gave people “an additional motive to give, since every man’s donation would be doubled.” Political opponents would later criticize Franklin for being too conniving, but he took great joy in this example of his cleverness. “I do not remember any of my political maneuvers the success of which gave me at the time more pleasure, or that in after thinking about it I more easily excused myself for having made use of cunning.”<a href="part0030_split_007.html#ch_7_en_2" id="ch_7_een_2"><sup class="calibre7">2</sup></a></span></p>
<h3 class="chapterHeadA">An American Political Philosophy</h3>
<p class="para"><span>By coming up with what is now known as the matching grant, Franklin showed how government and private initiative could be woven together, which remains to this day a very American approach. He believed in volunteerism and limited government, but also that there was a legitimate role for government in fostering the common good. By working through public-private partnerships, he felt, governments could have the best impact while avoiding the imposition of too much authority from above.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>There were other streaks of conservatism, albeit what would now be labeled compassionate conservatism, in Franklin’s political style. He believed very much in order, and it would end up taking a lot to radicalize him into an American revolutionary. Though charitable and very much a civic activist, he was wary of the unintended consequences of too much social engineering.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>This was reflected in a ruminative letter on human nature he sent to his London friend Peter Collinson. “Whenever we attempt to mend the scheme of providence,” Franklin wrote, “we had need be very circumspect lest we do more harm than good.” Perhaps even welfare for the poor was an example. He asked whether “the laws peculiar to England which compel the rich to maintain the poor have not given the latter a dependence.” It was “godlike” and laudable, he added, “to relieve the misfortunes of our fellow creatures,” but might it not in the end “provide encouragements for laziness”? He added a cautionary tale about the New Englanders who decided to get rid of blackbirds that were eating the corn crop. The result was that the worms the blackbirds used to eat proliferated and destroyed the grass and grain crops.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>But these were questions more than assertions. In his political philosophy, as in his religion and science, Franklin was generally non-ideological, indeed allergic to anything smacking of dogma. Instead, he was, as in most aspects of his life, interested in finding out what worked. As one writer noted, he exemplified the Enlightenment’s “regard for reason and nature, its social consciousness, its progressivism, its tolerance, its cosmopolitanism, and its bland philanthropy.” He had an empirical temperament that was generally averse to sweeping passions, and he espoused a kindly humanism that emphasized the somewhat sentimental (but still quite real) earthly goal of “doing good” for his fellow man.<a href="part0030_split_007.html#ch_7_en_3" id="ch_7_een_3"><sup class="calibre7">3</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>What made him a bit of a rebel, and later much more of one, was his inbred resistance to establishment authority. Not awed by rank, he was eager to avoid importing to America the rigid class structure of England. Instead, even as a retired would-be gentleman, he continued in his writings and letters to extol the diligence of the middling class of tradesmen, shopkeepers, and leather-aprons.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Out of this arose a vision of America as a nation where people, whatever their birth or social class, could rise (as he did) to wealth and status based on their willingness to be industrious and cultivate their virtues. In this regard, his ideal was more egalitarian and democratic than even Thomas Jefferson’s view of a “natural aristocracy,” which sought to pluck selected men with promising “virtues and talents” and groom them to be part of a new leadership elite. Franklin’s own idea was more expansive: he believed in encouraging and providing opportunities for all people to succeed based on their diligence, hard work, virtue, and ambition. His proposals for what became the University of Pennsylvania (in contrast to Jefferson’s for the University of Virginia) were aimed not at filtering a new elite but at encouraging and enriching all “aspiring” young men.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin’s political attitudes, along with his religious and scientific ones, fit together into a rather coherent outlook. But just as he was not a profound religious or scientific theorist—no Aquinas or Newton—neither was he a profound political philosopher on the order of a Locke or even a Jefferson. His strength as a political thinker, as in other fields, was more practical than abstract.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>This was evident in one of his most important political tracts, “Observations Concerning the Increase of Mankind,” which he wrote in 1751. The abundance of unsettled land in America, he said, led to a faster population growth. This was not a philosophical surmise but an empirical calculation. He observed that the colonists were only half as likely as the English to remain unmarried, that they married younger (around age 20), and that they averaged twice as many children (approximately eight). Thus, he concluded, America’s population would double every twenty years and surpass that of England in one hundred years.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>He turned out to be right. America’s population surpassed that of England by 1851, and kept doubling every two decades until the frontier ran out at the end of that century. Adam Smith cited Franklin’s tract in his 1776 classic, <span class="italic"><span>The Wealth of Nations,</span></span> and Thomas Malthus, famous for his gloomy views on overpopulation and inevitable poverty, also used Franklin’s calculations.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin, however, was no Malthusian pessimist. He believed that, at least in America, increased productivity would keep ahead of population growth, thus making everyone better off as the country grew. In fact, he predicted (also correctly) that what would restrain America’s population growth in the future was likely to be wealth rather than poverty, because richer people tended to be more “cautious” about getting married and having children.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin’s most influential argument—one that would play a significant role in the struggles ahead—was against the prevailing British mercantilist desire to restrain manufacturing in America. Parliament had just passed a bill prohibiting ironworks in America, and it held fast to an economic system based on using the colonies as a source of raw materials and a market for finished products.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin countered that America’s abundance of open land would preclude the development of a large pool of cheap urban labor. “The danger, therefore, of these colonies interfering with their Mother Country in trades that depend on labor, manufactures, etc., is too remote to require the attention of Great Britain.” Britain would soon be unable to supply all of America’s needs. “Therefore Britain should not too much restrain manufactures in her colonies. A wise and good mother will not do it. To distress is to weaken, and weakening the children weakens the whole family.”<a href="part0030_split_007.html#ch_7_en_4" id="ch_7_een_4"><sup class="calibre7">4</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>The seriousness of this tract on imperial affairs was balanced by a satirical one he wrote around the same time. Britain had been expelling convicts to America, which it justified as a way to help the colonies grow. Writing as Americanus in the <span class="italic"><span>Gazette,</span></span> Franklin sarcastically noted that “such a tender parental concern in our Mother Country for the welfare of her children calls aloud for the highest returns of gratitude.” So he proposed that America ship a boatload of rattlesnakes back to England. Perhaps the change of climate might tame them, which is what the British had claimed would happen to the convicts. Even if not, the British would get the better deal, “for the rattlesnake gives warning before he attempts his mischief, which the convict does not.”<a href="part0030_split_007.html#ch_7_en_5" id="ch_7_een_5"><sup class="calibre7">5</sup></a></span></p>
<h3 class="chapterHeadA">Slavery and Race</h3>
<p class="para"><span>One great moral issue historians must wrestle with when assessing America’s Founders is slavery, and Franklin was wrestling with it as well. Slaves made up about 6 percent of Philadelphia’s population at the time, and Franklin had facilitated the buying and selling of them through ads in his newspaper. “A likely Negro woman to be sold. Enquire at the Widow Read’s,” read one such ad on behalf of his mother-in-law. Another offered for sale “a likely young Negro fellow” and ended with the phrase “enquire of the printer hereof.” He personally owned a slave couple, but in 1751 he decided to sell them because, as he told his mother, he did not like having “Negro servants” and he found them uneconomical. Nevertheless, he would later, at times, have a slave as a personal servant.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>In “Observations on the Increase of Mankind,” he attacked slavery on economic grounds. Comparing the costs and benefits of owning a slave, he concluded that it made no sense. “The introduction of slaves,” he wrote, was one of the things that “diminish a nation.” But he mainly focused on the ill effects to the owners rather than the immorality done to the slaves. “The whites who have slaves, not laboring, are enfeebled,” he said. “Slaves also pejorate the families that use them; white children become proud, disgusted with labor.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>The tract was, in fact, quite prejudiced in places. He decried German immigration, and he urged that America be settled mainly by whites of English descent. “The number of purely white people in the world is proportionally very small,” he wrote. “Why increase the sons of Africa by planting them in America, where we have so fair an opportunity, by excluding all blacks and tawneys, of increasing the lovely white and red? But perhaps I am partial to the complexion of my country, for such kind of partiality is natural to mankind.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>As the final sentence indicates, he was beginning to reexamine his “partiality” to his own race. In the first edition of “Observations,” he remarked on “almost every slave being by nature a thief.” When he reprinted it eighteen years later, he changed it to say that they became thieves “from the nature of slavery.” He also omitted the entire section about the desirability of keeping America mainly white.<a href="part0030_split_007.html#ch_7_en_6" id="ch_7_een_6"><sup class="calibre7">6</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>What helped shift his attitude was another of his philanthropic endeavors. In the late 1750s, he became active in an organization that established schools for black children in Philadelphia and then elsewhere in America. After visiting the Philadelphia school in 1763, he would write a reflective letter about his previous prejudices:</span></p>
<div class="extract">
<p class="extractText"><span>I was on the whole much pleased, and from what I then saw have conceived a higher opinion of the natural capacities of the black race than I had ever before entertained. Their apprehension seems as quick, their memory as strong, and their docility in every respect equal to that of white children. You will wonder perhaps that I should ever doubt it, and I will not undertake to justify all my prejudices.<a href="part0030_split_007.html#ch_7_en_7" id="ch_7_een_7"><sup class="calibre7">7</sup></a></span></p>
</div>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span>In his later life, as we shall see, he became one of America’s most active abolitionists, one who denounced slavery on moral grounds and helped advance the rights of blacks.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>As indicated by the phrase he used in “Observations” about increasing “the lovely white and red” faces in America, Franklin’s feelings about the Indians were generally positive. He marveled, in a letter to Collinson, that the simplicity of the Indians’ wilderness life had a romantic appeal. “They have never shown any inclination to change their manner of life for ours,” he wrote. “When an Indian child has been brought up among us, taught our language and habituated to our customs, yet if he goes to see his relations and make one Indian ramble with them, there is no persuading him ever to return.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>White people also sometimes feel this preference for the Indians’ way of living, Franklin noted. When white children were captured and raised by Indians, then later returned to white society, “in a short time they become disgusted with our manner of life, and the care and pains that are necessary to support it, and take the first good opportunity of escaping again into the woods.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>He also told the story of some Massachusetts commissioners who invited the Indians to send a dozen of their youth to study free at Harvard. The Indians replied that they had sent some of their young braves to study there years earlier, but on their return “they were absolutely good for nothing, being neither acquainted with the true methods for killing deer, catching beaver, or surprising an enemy.” They offered instead to educate a dozen or so white children in the ways of the Indians “and make men of them.”<a href="part0030_split_007.html#ch_7_en_8" id="ch_7_een_8"><sup class="calibre7">8</sup></a></span></p>
<h3 class="chapterHeadA">Assemblyman, Indian Diplomat,<br class="calibre"/>
and Postmaster</h3>
<p class="para"><span>Serving as clerk of the Pennsylvania Assembly, as he had since 1736, frustrated Franklin. Unable to take part in the debates, he amused himself by concocting his numerical magic squares. So when one of the members from Philadelphia died in 1751, Franklin readily accepted election to the seat (and passed on the clerkship to his unemployed son, William). “I conceived my becoming a member would enlarge my powers of doing good,” he recalled, but then admitted: “I would not, however, insinuate that my ambition was not flattered.”<a href="part0030_split_007.html#ch_7_en_9" id="ch_7_een_9"><sup class="calibre7">9</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Thus began Franklin’s career in politics, which would last for most of thirty-seven years until his retirement as president of the Pennsylvania Executive Council. As a private citizen, he had proposed various civic improvement schemes, such as the library, fire corps, and police patrol. Now, as a member of the Assembly, he could do even more to be, as he put it, “a great promoter of useful projects.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>The quintessence of these was his effort to sweep, pave, and light the city streets. The endeavor began when he became bothered by the dust in front of his house, which faced the farmers’ market. So he found “a poor industrious man” who was willing to sweep the block for a monthly fee and then wrote a paper that described all the benefits of hiring him. Houses on the block would remain cleaner, he noted, and shops would attract more customers. He sent the paper around to his neighbors, who all agreed to contribute a portion of the street sweeper’s pay each month. The beauty of the scheme was that it opened the way for grander civic improvements. “This raised a general desire to have all the streets paved,” Franklin recalled, “and made the people more willing to submit to a tax for that purpose.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>As a result, Franklin was able to draw up a bill in the Assembly to pay for street paving, and he accompanied it with a proposal to install street lamps in front of each house. With his love of science and detail, Franklin even worked on a design for the lamps. The globes imported from London, he noticed, did not have a vent on the bottom to allow air in, which meant the smoke collected and darkened the glass. Franklin invented a new model with vents and a chimney, so that the lamp remained clean and bright. He also designed the style of lamp, common today, that had four flat panes of glass rather than one globe, making it easier to repair if broken. “Some may think these trifling matters not worth minding,” Franklin said, but they should remember that “human felicity is produced…by little advantages that occur every day.”<a href="part0030_split_007.html#ch_7_en_10" id="ch_7_een_10"><sup class="calibre7">10</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>There were, of course, more momentous issues to debate. The Assembly was dominated by Quakers, who were generally pacifist and frugal. They were often at odds with the family of the Proprietors, led by the great William Penn’s not-so-great son Thomas, who didn’t help relations when he married an Anglican and drifted away from the Quaker faith. The main concerns of the Proprietors were getting more land from the Indians and making sure that their property remained exempt from taxation.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>(Pennsylvania was a Proprietary colony, which meant that it was governed by a private family that owned most of the unsettled land. In 1681, Charles II granted such a charter to William Penn, in repayment of a debt. A majority of the colonies started out as Proprietary ones, but by the 1720s most had become Royal colonies directly ruled by the king and his ministers. Only Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Delaware remained under their Proprietors until the Revolution.)</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Two big issues faced Pennsylvania at the time: forging good relations with the Indians and protecting the colony from the French. These were related, because alliances with the Indians became all the more important whenever the recurring wars with the French flared up.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Remaining on good terms with the Indians required significant sums of money for gifts, and colonial defense was also costly. This led to complex political struggles in Pennsylvania. The Quakers opposed military spending on principle, and the Penns (acting through a series of appointed lackey governors) opposed anything that would cost them much money or subject their lands to taxes.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin had been instrumental in finessing these issues in 1747, when he formed the voluntary militia. But by the early 1750s, tensions with France over control of the Ohio valley were rising again and would soon erupt into the French and Indian War (an offshoot of what was known in Europe as the Seven Years’ War). The situation would lead Franklin to take two momentous initiatives that were to shape not only his political career but also the destiny of America:</span></p>
<ul class="calibre9">
<li class="calibre8">He became an increasingly fervent opponent of the Proprietors, and eventually of the British, as they stubbornly asserted their right to control the taxes and government of the colony, a stance that reflected his anti-authoritarian and populist sentiments.</li>
<li class="calibre8">He became a leader of the effort to get the colonies, heretofore truculently independent of one another, to join together and unite for common purposes, which reflected his penchant for forging associations, his nonparochial view of America, and his belief that people could accomplish more when they worked together than when they stood separately.</li>
</ul>
<p class="para"><span>The process began in 1753, when Franklin was appointed one of three commissioners from Pennsylvania to attend a summit conference with a congregation of Indian leaders at Carlisle, halfway between Philadelphia and the Ohio River. The goal was to secure the allegiance of the Delaware Indians, who were angry with the Penns for cheating them in what was known as the “Walking Purchase.” (An old deed had given the Penns a tract of Indian land that was defined as what a man could walk in a day and a half, and Thomas Penn had hired three fleet runners to sprint for thirty-six hours, thus claiming far more land than intended.) Allied on the side of the Pennsylvanians were the Six Nations of the Iroquois confederacy, which included the Mohawk and Seneca tribes.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>More than a hundred Indians came to the Carlisle conference. After the Pennsylvanians presented the traditional string of wampum, in this case, a whopping £800 worth of gifts,<a href="part0013.html#ft_4"><sup class="calibre7">*</sup></a> the Iroquois chief Scaroyady proposed a peace plan. The white settlers should pull back to the east of the Appalachians, and their traders should be regulated to operate honestly and sell the Indians more ammunition and less rum. They also wanted assurances that the English would help defend them from the French, who were militarizing the Ohio valley.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>The Pennsylvanians ended up pledging little more than a stricter regulation of their traders, which eventually caused the Delaware to drift over to the French side. On the last night, Franklin saw a frightening display of the dangers of rum. The Pennsylvanians had refused to offer the Indians any until the summit was over, and when the ban was lifted, a bacchanal erupted. As Franklin described the scene:</span></p>
<div class="extract">
<p class="extractText"><span>They had made a great bonfire in the middle of the square. They were all drunk, men and women, quarreling and fighting. Their dark-colored bodies, half naked, seen only by the gloomy light of the bonfire, running after and beating one another with firebrands, accompanied by their horrid yellings, formed a scene the most resembling our ideas of hell that could well be imagined.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin and his fellow commissioners wrote an angry report decrying the white traders who regularly sold rum to the Indians. By doing so they threatened to “to keep these poor Indians continually under the force of liquor” and “entirely estrange the affections of the Indians from the English.”<a href="part0030_split_007.html#ch_7_en_11" id="ch_7_een_11"><sup class="calibre7">11</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Upon his return, Franklin learned that he had been appointed by the British government to share, along with William Hunter of Virginia, the top post office job in America, known as the Deputy Postmaster for the Colonies. He had been eagerly seeking the position for two years and had even authorized Collinson to spend up to £300 lobbying on his behalf in London. “However,” Franklin joked, “the less it costs the better, as it is for life only, which is an uncertain tenure.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>His quest was driven by his usual mix of motives: control of the post would allow him to invigorate the American Philosophical Society, improve his publishing network by placing friends and relatives in postal jobs across America, and perhaps make some money. He installed his son as Philadelphia’s postmaster, and he later gave jobs in various towns to his brothers Peter and John, John’s stepson, his sister Jane’s son, two of Deborah’s relatives, and his New York printing partner James Parker.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin drew up typically detailed procedures for running the service more efficiently, established the first home-delivery system and dead letter office, and took frequent inspection tours. Within a year, he had cut to one day the delivery time of a letter from New York to Philadelphia. The reforms were costly, and he and Hunter incurred £900 in debt over their first four years. But then they started turning a profit, earning at least £300 a year apiece.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>By 1774, when the British fired him for his rebellious political stances, he would be making more than £700 a year. But an even greater benefit of the job, both to him and history, was that it furthered Franklin’s conception of the disparate American colonies as a potentially unified nation with shared interests and needs.<a href="part0030_split_007.html#ch_7_en_12" id="ch_7_een_12"><sup class="calibre7">12</sup></a></span></p>
<h3 class="chapterHeadA">The Albany Plan for<br class="calibre"/>
an American Union</h3>
<p class="para"><span>The summit of Pennsylvanians and Indians at Carlisle had done nothing to deter the French. Their goal was to confine the British settlers to the East Coast by building a series of forts along the Ohio River that would create a French arc from Canada to Louisiana. In response, Virginia’s governor sent a promising young soldier named George Washington to the Ohio valley in late 1753 to demand that the French vacate. He failed, but his vivid account of the mission made him a hero and a colonel. The following spring, he began a series of haphazard raids against the French forts that would grow into a full-scale war.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Britain’s ministers had been wary of encouraging too much cooperation among their colonies, but the French threat now made it necessary. The Board of Trade in London thus asked each colony to send delegates to a conference in Albany, New York, in June 1754. They would have two missions: meeting with the Iroquois confederation to reaffirm their allegiance and discussing among themselves ways to create a more unified colonial defense.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Cooperation among the colonies did not come naturally. Some of their assemblies declined the invitation, and most of the seven that accepted instructed their delegates to avoid any plan for colonial confederation. Franklin, on the other hand, was always eager to foster more unity. “It would be a very strange thing,” he had written his friend James Parker in 1751, “if six nations of ignorant savages [the Iroquois] could be capable of forming a scheme for such a union…and yet that a like union should be impracticable for ten or a dozen English colonies, to whom it is more necessary.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>In his letter to Parker, Franklin sketched out a structure for colonial cooperation: there should be, he said, a General Council with delegates from all the colonies, in rough proportion to the amount each paid in taxes to the general treasury, and a governor appointed by the king. The meeting sites should rotate among the various colonial capitals, so delegates could better understand the rest of America, and money would be raised by a tax on liquor. Typically, he felt the council should arise voluntarily rather than being imposed by London. The best way to get it going, he thought, was to pick a handful of smart men to visit influential people throughout the colonies and enlist support. “Reasonable, sensible men can always make a reasonable scheme appear such to other reasonable men.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>When news of Washington’s defeats reached Philadelphia in May 1754, just before the Albany conference, Franklin wrote an editorial in the <span class="italic"><span>Gazette.</span></span> He blamed the French success “on the present disunited state of the British colonies.” Next to the article he printed the first and most famous editorial cartoon in American history: a snake cut into pieces, labeled with names of the colonies, with the caption: “Join, or Die.”<a href="part0030_split_007.html#ch_7_en_13" id="ch_7_een_13"><sup class="calibre7">13</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin was one of the four commissioners (along with the Proprietor’s private secretary, Richard Peters, Thomas Penn’s nephew John, and Assembly Speaker Isaac Norris) chosen to represent Pennsylvania at the Albany Conference. The Assembly, to his regret, had gone on record against “propositions for a union of the colonies,” but Franklin was undeterred. He carried with him, as he left Philadelphia, a paper he had written called “Short Hints towards a Scheme for Uniting the Northern Colonies.” It had one modification from the union plan that he had described in his earlier letter to James Parker: because the colonial assemblies seemed recalcitrant, perhaps it would be best, if and when the commissioners in Albany adopted such a plan, to send it back to London “and an act of Parliament obtained for establishing it.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>On a stopover in New York, Franklin shared with friends the plan he had drafted. In the meantime, Peters and others went shopping for the £500 of wampum the Assembly had authorized as gifts for the Indians: blankets, ribbons, gunpowder, guns, vermilion for face paint, kettles, and cloth. Then, on June 9, they left on a well-laden sloop for Albany with “a pipe of the oldest and best Madeira wine to be got.”<a href="part0030_split_007.html#ch_7_en_14" id="ch_7_een_14"><sup class="calibre7">14</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Before the Indians arrived, the twenty-four colonial commissioners gathered for their own discussions. New York governor James DeLancey proposed a plan to build two western forts, but it stalled because the delegates could not agree to share the costs. So a motion was passed, likely at Franklin’s instigation, that a committee be appointed “to prepare and receive plans or schemes for the union of the colonies.” Franklin was one of seven named to the committee, which offered a perfect venue for him to gather support for the plan he had in his pocket.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>In the meantime, the Indians arrived led by the Mohawk chief Tiyanoga, also known as Hendrick Peters. He was scornful. The Six Nations had been neglected, he said, “and when you neglect business, the French take advantage of it.” In another tirade he added, “Look at the French! They are men, they are fortifying everywhere. But, we are ashamed to say it, you are all like women.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>After a week of discussions, the commissioners made a series of promises to the Indians: There would be more consultation on settlements and trade routes, certain land sales would be investigated, and laws would be passed to restrict the rum trade. The Indians, with little choice, accepted the presents and declared their covenant chain with the English to be “solemnly renewed.” Franklin was not impressed. “We brightened the chain with them,” he wrote Peter Collinson, “but in my opinion no assistance is to be expected from them in any dispute with the French until by a complete union among ourselves we are able to support them in case they should be attacked.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>In his effort to forge such a union at Albany, Franklin’s key ally was a wealthy Massachusetts shipping merchant named Thomas Hutchinson. (Remember the name; he was later to become a fateful foe.) The plan that their committee approved was based on the one Franklin had written. There would be a national congress composed of representatives selected by each state roughly in proportion to their population and wealth. The executive would be a “President General” appointed by the king.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>At its core was a somewhat new concept that became known as federalism. A “General Government” would handle matters such as national defense and westward expansion, but each colony would keep its own constitution and local governing power. Though he was sometimes dismissed as more of a practitioner than a visionary, Franklin in Albany had helped to devise a federal concept—orderly, balanced, and enlightened—that would eventually form the basis for a unified American nation.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>On July 10, more than a week after the Indians had left Albany, the full group of commissioners finally voted on the plan. Some New York delegates opposed it, as did Isaac Norris, the Quaker leader of Pennsylvania’s Assembly, but it nevertheless passed rather easily. Only a few revisions had been made to the scheme sketched out in the “Short Hints” that Franklin had carried with him to Albany, and he accepted them in the spirit of compromise. “When one has so many different people with different opinions to deal with in a new affair,” he explained to his friend Cadwallader Colden, “one is obliged sometimes to give up some smaller points in order to obtain greater.” It was a sentiment he would express in similar words when he became the key conciliator at the Constitutional Convention thirty-three years later.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>The commissioners decided that the plan should be sent both to the colonial assemblies and to Parliament for approval, and Franklin promptly launched a public campaign on its behalf. This included a spirited exchange of open letters with Massachusetts governor William Shirley, who argued that the king rather than the colonial assemblies should choose the federal congress. Franklin replied with a principle that would be at the heart of the struggles ahead: “It is supposed an undoubted right of Englishmen not to be taxed but by their own consent given through their representatives.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>It was to no avail. The Albany Plan was rejected by all of the colonial assemblies for usurping too much of their power, and it was shelved in London for giving too much power to voters and encouraging a dangerous unity among the colonies. “The assemblies did not adopt it as they all thought there was too much <span class="italic"><span>prerogative</span></span> in it,” Franklin recalled, “and in England it was judged to have too much of the <span class="italic"><span>democratic.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Looking back on it near the end of his life, Franklin was convinced that the acceptance of his Albany Plan could have prevented the Revolution and created a harmonious empire. “The colonies so united would have been sufficiently strong to have defended themselves,” he reasoned. “There would then have been no need of troops from England; of course the subsequent pretence for taxing America, and the bloody contest it occasioned, would have been avoided.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>On that score he was probably mistaken. Further conflicts over Britain’s right to tax her colonies and keep them subservient were almost inevitable. But for the next two decades, Franklin would struggle to find a harmonious solution even as he became more convinced of the need for the colonies to unite.<a href="part0030_split_007.html#ch_7_en_15" id="ch_7_een_15"><sup class="calibre7">15</sup></a></span></p>
<h3 class="chapterHeadA">Catherine Ray</h3>
<p class="para"><span>After the Albany Conference, Franklin embarked on a tour of his postal realms that culminated in a visit to Boston. He had not been back there since before his mother’s death two years earlier, and he spent time with his sprawling family, arranging jobs and apprenticeships. While staying with his brother John, he met an entrancing young woman who became the first intriguing example of his many amorous and romantic—but probably never consummated—flirtations.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Catherine Ray was a lively and fresh 23-year-old from Block Island, whose sister was married to John Franklin’s stepson. Franklin, then 48, was immediately both charmed and charming. She was a great talker; so too was Franklin, when he wanted to flatter, and he was also a great listener. They played a game where he tried to guess her thoughts; she called him a conjurer and relished his attention. She made sugarplums; he insisted they were the best he’d ever eaten.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>When it came time, after a week, for her to leave Boston to visit another sister in Newport, he decided to accompany her. Along the way, their poorly shod horses had trouble on the icy hills; they got caught in cold rains and on one occasion took a wrong turn. But they would recall, years later, the fun they had talking for hours, exploring ideas, gently flirting. After two days with her family in Newport, he saw her off on the boat to Block Island. “I stood on the shore,” he wrote her shortly afterward, “and looked after you, until I could no longer distinguish you, even with my glass.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>He left for Philadelphia slowly and with reluctance, loitering on the way for weeks. When he finally arrived home, there was a letter from her. Over the next few months he would write her six times, and through the course of their lives more than forty letters would pass between them. Franklin didn’t save most of her letters, perhaps out of prudence, but the correspondence that does survive reveals a remarkable friendship and provides insights into Franklin’s relations with women.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>From reading their letters, and reading between the lines, one gets the impression that Franklin made a few playful advances that Caty gently deflected, and he seemed to respect her all the more for it. “I write this during a Northeaster storm of snow,” he said in the first one he sent after their meeting. “The snowy fleeces which are pure as your virgin innocence, white as your lovely bosom—and as cold.” In a letter a few months later, he spoke of life, math, and the role of “multiplication” in marriage, adding roguishly: “I would gladly have taught you that myself, but you thought it was time enough, and wouldn’t learn.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Nevertheless, Caty’s letters to him were filled with ardor. “Absence rather increases than lessens my affections,” she wrote. “Love me one thousandth part so well as I do you.” She was soulful and tearful in her letters, which conveyed her affection for him yet also described the men who were courting her. She begged him to destroy them after he had finished reading them. “I have said a thousand things that nothing should have tempted me to say.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin reassured her that he would be discreet. “You may write freely everything you think fit, without the least apprehension of any person’s seeing your letters but myself,” he promised. “I know very well that the most innocent expressions of warm friendship…between persons of different sexes are liable to be misinterpreted by suspicious minds.” That, he explained, was why he was being circumspect in his own letters. “Though you say more, I say less than I think.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>And so we are left with a set of surviving letters that are filled with nothing more than tantalizing flirtations. She sent him some sugarplums that she had marked with (one assumes) a kiss. “They are every one sweetened as you used to like,” she said. He replied, “The plums came safe, and were so sweet from the cause you mentioned that I could scarce taste the sugar.” He spoke of the “pleasures of life” and noted that “I still have them all in my power.” She wrote of spinning a long strand of thread, and he replied, “I wish I had hold of one end of it, to pull you to me.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>How did his loyal and patient wife, Deborah, fit into this type of long-distance flirtation? Oddly enough, he seemed to use her as a shield, both with Caty and the other young women he later toyed with, to keep his relationships just on the safe side of propriety. He invariably invoked Deborah’s name and praised her virtues in almost every letter he wrote to Caty. It was as if he wanted Caty to keep her ardor in perspective and to realize that, though his affection was real, his flirtations were merely playful. Or, perhaps, once his sexual advances had been rebuffed, he wanted to show (or to pretend) that they had not been serious. “I almost forgot I had a home,” he wrote to Caty in describing his trip back from their first encounter. But soon he began “to think of and wish for home, and as I drew nearer I found the attraction stronger and stronger.” So he sped ever faster, he wrote, “to my own house and to the arms of my good old wife and children, where I remain, thanks to God.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Later that fall, he was even more explicit in reminding Caty that he was a married man. When she sent him a present of cheese, he replied, “Mrs. Franklin was very proud that a young lady should have so much regard for her old husband as to send such a present. We talk of you every time it comes to table.” Indeed, there was an interesting aspect to this and subsequent letters he wrote to her: they revealed less about the nature of his relationship with Caty than about the relationship, less passionate but deeply comfortable, that he had with his wife. As he told Caty, “She is sure you are a sensible girl and…talks of bequeathing me to you as a legacy. But I ought to wish you a better, and hope she will live these hundred years; for we are grown old together, and if she has any faults I am so used to them that I don’t perceive them…Let us join in wishing the old lady a long life and happy.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Instead of merely continuing their flirtation, Franklin also began to provide Caty with paternal exhortations about duty and virtue. “Be a good girl,” he urged, “until you get a good husband; then stay at home, and nurse the children, and live like a Christian.” He hoped that when he next visited her, he would find her surrounded by “plump, juicy, blushing pretty little rogues, like their mama.” And so it happened. The next time they met, she was married to William Greene, a future governor of Rhode Island, with whom she would have six children.<a href="part0030_split_007.html#ch_7_en_16" id="ch_7_een_16"><sup class="calibre7">16</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>So what are we to make of their relationship? Clearly, there were sweet hints of romantic attraction. But unless Franklin was dissembling in his letters in order to protect her reputation (and his), the joy came from fun fancies rather than physical realities. It was probably typical of the many flirtations he would have with younger women over the years: slightly naughty in a playful way, flattering to both parties, filled with intimations of intimacy, engaging both the heart and the mind. Despite a reputation for lecherousness that he did little to dispel, there is no evidence of any serious sexual affair he had after his marriage to Deborah.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Claude-Anne Lopez, a former editor of the Franklin Papers project at Yale, has spent years researching his private life. Her analysis of the type of relationships he had with women such as Catherine Ray seems both astute and credible:</span></p>
<div class="extract">
<p class="extractText"><span>A romance? Yes, but a romance in the Franklinian manner, somewhat risqué, somewhat avuncular, taking a bold step forward and an ironic step backward, implying that he is tempted as a man but respectful as a friend. Of all shades of feeling, this one, the one the French call <span class="italic"><span>amité amoureuse</span></span>—a little beyond the platonic but short of the grand passion—is perhaps the most exquisite.<a href="part0030_split_007.html#ch_7_en_17" id="ch_7_een_17"><sup class="calibre7">17</sup></a></span></p>
</div>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin only occasionally forged intimate bonds with his male friends, who tended to be either intellectual companions or jovial club colleagues. But he relished being with women, and he formed deep and lasting relationships with many. For him, such relationships were not a sport or trifling amusement, despite how they might appear, but a pleasure to be savored and respected. Throughout his life, Franklin would lose many male friends, but he never lost a female one, including Caty Ray. As he would tell her thirty-five years later, just a year before he died, “Among the felicities of my life I reckon your friendship.”<a href="part0030_split_007.html#ch_7_en_18" id="ch_7_een_18"><sup class="calibre7">18</sup></a></span></p>
<h3 class="chapterHeadA">Supplying General Braddock</h3>
<p class="para"><span>When he returned to Philadelphia in early 1755 after his dalliance with Caty Ray, Franklin was able, for the moment, to forge a workable relationship with most of the political leaders there. The Proprietors had appointed a new governor, Robert Hunter Morris, and Franklin assured him that he would have a comfortable tenure “if you will only take care not to enter into any dispute with the Assembly.” Morris responded half-jokingly. “You know I love disputing,” he said. “It is one of my greatest pleasures.” Nevertheless, he promised to “if possible avoid them.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin likewise worked hard to avoid disputes with the new governor, especially when it involved the issue of protecting Pennsylvania’s frontier. So he was pleased when the British decided to send Gen. Edward Braddock to America with the mission of pushing the French out of the Ohio valley, and he supported Governor Morris’s request that the Assembly appropriate funds to supply the troops.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Once again, the members insisted that the Proprietors’ estates be taxed. Franklin proposed some clever schemes involving loans and excise taxes designed to break the impasse, but he was not able to resolve the issue right away. So he took on the mission of finding other ways to make sure that Braddock got the necessary supplies.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>A delegation of three governors—Morris of Pennsylvania, Shirley of Massachusetts, and DeLancey of New York—had been chosen to meet with the general on his arrival in Virginia. The Pennsylvania Assembly wanted Franklin to be part of the delegation, as did his friend Governor Shirley, and Franklin was eager to be involved. So he joined the group wearing his postmaster hat, ostensibly to help arrange ways to facilitate Braddock’s communications. Along the way, he impressed his fellow delegation members with his scientific curiosity. Encountering a small whirlwind, Franklin rode his horse into it, studied its effects, and even tried to break it up with his whip.<a href="part0030_split_007.html#ch_7_en_19" id="ch_7_een_19"><sup class="calibre7">19</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>General Braddock was brimming with arrogance. “I see nothing that can obstruct my march to Niagara,” he crowed. Franklin cautioned that he should be wary of Indian ambushes. Replied Braddock: “These savages may be a formidable enemy to your raw American militia, but upon the king’s regular and disciplined troops, sir, it is impossible they would make any impression.” As Franklin later recalled, “He had too much self-confidence.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>What he lacked, besides humility, were supplies. Because the Americans had come up with only a fraction of the horses and wagons promised, he declared his intention to return home. Franklin interceded. Pennsylvanians would rally to his cause, he said. The general promptly designated Franklin to be in charge of procuring the equipment.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>The broadsides that Franklin wrote advertising Braddock’s need to hire horses and wagons played on fear, self-interest, and patriotism. The general had proposed to seize the horses and compel Americans into service, he said, but had been prevailed on instead to try “fair and equitable means.” The terms were good, Franklin argued: “The hire of these wagons and horses will amount to upwards of £30,000, which will be paid you in silver and gold and the King’s money.” As an inducement, he assured the farmers that “the service will be light and easy.” Finally came a threat that if voluntary offers did not come, “your loyalty will be strongly suspected,” “violent measures will probably be used,” and a “Hussar with a body of soldiers will immediately enter the province.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin acted selflessly, indeed remarkably so. When the farmers said they were unwilling to trust the financial pledges of an unknown general, Franklin gave his personal bond that they would receive full payment. His son, William, helped him sign up the farmers, and within two weeks they had procured 259 horses and 150 wagons.<a href="part0030_split_007.html#ch_7_en_20" id="ch_7_een_20"><sup class="calibre7">20</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>General Braddock was thrilled with Franklin’s performance, and the Assembly profusely commended him as well. But Governor Morris, not heeding Franklin’s advice to avoid disputes, could not resist attacking the Assembly for being of little help. This upset Franklin, but he still tried to be a conciliator. “I am heartily sick of our present situation: I like neither the governor’s conduct nor the Assembly’s,” he wrote his London friend Collinson, “and having some share in the confidence of both, I have endeavored to reconcile them, but in vain.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Ever collegial, Franklin was able to remain on good personal terms with the governor for the time being. “You must go home with me and spend the evening,” Morris said one day on meeting him on the street. “I am to have some company that you will like.” One guest told the tale of Sancho Panza, who, when offered a government, requested that his subjects be blacks so that he could sell them if they gave him trouble. “Why do you continue to side with these damned Quakers?” he asked Franklin. “Had not you better sell them? The Proprietors would give you a good price.” Franklin replied, “The governor has not yet <span class="italic"><span>blacked</span></span> them enough.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Though everyone laughed, the fissures were deepening. By attempting to blacken the reputation of the Assembly, Franklin later wrote, Morris had “negrofied himself.” Morris likewise had begun to distrust Franklin. In a letter to Proprietor Thomas Penn, he charged that Franklin was “as much a favorer of the unreasonable claims of American assemblies as any man whatever.”<a href="part0030_split_007.html#ch_7_en_21" id="ch_7_een_21"><sup class="calibre7">21</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>In the meantime, Braddock was confidently marching west. Most Philadelphians were sure that he would prevail, and they even launched a collection to buy fireworks to celebrate. Franklin, more cautious, refused to contribute. “The events of war are subject to great uncertainty,” he warned.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>His worries were warranted. The British army was ambushed and routed, and Braddock was killed along with two-thirds of his soldiers. “Who would have thought it?” Braddock whispered to an aide just before he died. Among the few survivors was the American colonel George Washington, who had two horses shot out from under him and four bullets pierce his clothing.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Adding to Franklin’s distress was the financial exposure he faced because of the loans he had personally guaranteed. These “amounted to near £20,000, which to pay would have ruined me,” he recalled. Just as the farmers began to sue him, Massachusetts governor Shirley, now the general of the British troops, came to his rescue and ordered that the farmers be paid from the army’s funds.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Braddock’s disaster increased the threat from the French and Indians, and it deepened the political rift in Philadelphia. The Assembly quickly passed a bill appropriating £50,000 for defense, but again it insisted a tax be placed on all lands, “those of the proprietors not excepted.” Governor Morris rejected it, demanding that the word “not” be changed to “only.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin was furious. No longer casting himself as a mediator, he wrote the reply that the Assembly sent to Morris. He called the governor a “hateful instrument of reducing a free people to the abject state of vassalage,” and he accused Proprietor Thomas Penn of “taking advantage of public calamity” and trying “to force down their throats laws of imposition abhorrent to common justice and common reason.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin became particularly enraged when he learned that Morris was required by a secret clause in his commission as governor to reject any tax on the Proprietary estates. In another message from the Assembly a week later, responding to Morris’s objection to the use of the word “vassalage,” Franklin wrote of Penn: “Our lord would have us defend his estate at our own expense! This is not merely vassalage, it is worse than any vassalage we have heard of; it is something we have no adequate name for; it is even more slavish than slavery itself.” In a subsequent message, he added what would become a revolutionary cry: “Those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>In the end, a series of patchwork compromises was reached. The Proprietors, on gauging the Assembly’s anger, agreed to a voluntary contribution of £5,000 to supplement whatever the Assembly raised. Although that defused the immediate crisis, the principle remained unresolved. More significant, for himself and for history, Franklin had abandoned his long-standing aversion to dispute. Henceforth he would become an increasingly fervent foe of the Proprietors.<a href="part0030_split_007.html#ch_7_en_22" id="ch_7_een_22"><sup class="calibre7">22</sup></a></span></p>
<h3 class="chapterHeadA">Colonel Franklin of the Militia</h3>
<p class="para"><span>The issue of how to pay for frontier defense had been settled, for the time being, by the uneasy compromises between the Assembly and the Proprietors. To Franklin fell the task of figuring out how to spend the money and raise a militia. He pushed through a bill to create a force that was purely voluntary, thus securing the support of the Quakers, and then published an imaginary discourse designed to rally support for the plan. One character, objecting to the idea that the Quakers did not have to join, declares, “Hang me if I’ll fight to save the Quakers.” Replies his friend: “That is to say you won’t pump ship, because it will save the rats as well as yourself.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin’s plan was modeled on the Association Militia he had organized in 1747, but this time it would be under the aegis of the government. Once again, he spelled out at length the details of training, organization, and election of officers. In one letter he also came up with a very specific scheme for using dogs as scouts. “They should be large, strong and fierce,” he wrote, “and every dog led in a slip strong to prevent them tiring themselves by running out and in and discovering the party by barking at squirrels.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Governor Morris grudgingly accepted Franklin’s militia bill, though he disliked the provisions making it voluntary and allowing the democratic election of officers. Even more distressing was that Franklin had become the de facto leader and most powerful man in the colony. “Since Mr. Franklin has put himself at the head of the Assembly,” Morris warned Penn, his followers “are using every means in their power, even while their country is invaded, to wrest the government out of your hands.” For his part, Franklin had developed a burning contempt for Morris. “This man is half a madman,” he wrote the Assembly’s lobbyist in London.<a href="part0030_split_007.html#ch_7_en_23" id="ch_7_een_23"><sup class="calibre7">23</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>The Proprietors’ fears were not calmed when Franklin donned a military uniform and, along with his son, headed to the frontier to oversee the construction of a line of stockades. He spent the week of his fiftieth birthday, in January 1756, camping at the Lehigh Gap and dining on the provisions that his dutiful wife had sent. “We have enjoyed your roast beef and this day began on the roast veal,” he wrote her. “Citizens that have their dinners hot know nothing of good eating; we find it in much greater perfection when the kitchen is four score miles from the dining room.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin enjoyed his stint as a frontier commander. Among his clever accomplishments was devising a reliable method for getting the five hundred soldiers under his command to attend worship services: he assigned to the militia’s chaplain the task of doling out the daily allotments of rum right after his services. “Never were prayers more generally and punctually attended.” He also found time to observe and record, in his wry way, the customs of the local Moravians, who believed in arranged marriages. “I objected if the matches were not made by the mutual choice of the parties, some of them may chance to be very unhappy,” Franklin recounted. “‘And so they may,’ answered my informer, ‘if you let the parties choose for themselves,’ which indeed I could not deny.”<a href="part0030_split_007.html#ch_7_en_24" id="ch_7_een_24"><sup class="calibre7">24</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para"><span>After seven weeks on the frontier, Franklin returned to Philadelphia. Despite the worries of the Proprietors and their governor, he had little desire to play the hero on horseback or parlay his popularity into political power. Indeed, he hurried his return so that he arrived late at night to avoid the triumphant welcome that his supporters had planned.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>He did not, however, decline when the militia’s Philadelphia regiment elected him their colonel. Governor Morris, who had reluctantly sought Franklin’s help during the crisis, balked at approving the selection. But he had little choice, as Franklin’s militia bill called for the democratic selection of officers, and after a few weeks he grudgingly assented.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Throughout his life, Franklin would find himself torn (and amused) by the conflict between his professed desire to acquire the virtue of humility and his natural thirst for acclaim. His tenure as a colonel was no exception. He could not refrain from indulging his vanity by scheduling a grand public review of his troops. More than a thousand marched past his Market Street house with great pomp and ceremony. Each company arrived to the sounds of fifes and oboes, showed off their freshly painted cannons, and then fired off a volley to herald the arrival of the next company. The shots, he later noted wryly, “shook down and broke several glasses of my electrical apparatus.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>When he left a few weeks later on a postal inspection trip, “the officers of my regiment took it into their heads that it would be proper for them to escort me out of town.” They drew their swords and accompanied him to the ferry, which infuriated Thomas Penn when he read of it in London. “This silly affair,” Franklin noted, “greatly increased his rancor against me…and he instanced this parade with my officers as a proof of my having an intention to take the government of the province out of his hands by force.” Franklin was likewise “chagrined” by the display, or at least so he said in retrospect. “I had not been previously acquainted with the project or I should have prevented it, being naturally averse to the assuming of state on any occasion.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>In fairness to Franklin, he was never the type of person who liked to revel in public ceremony or the pomposity and perks of power. When Penn and his allies sought to neutralize him by forming rival militias in Philadelphia and then convincing the king’s ministers to nullify his militia act, Franklin responded by readily surrendering his commission. In a reflective letter to his friend Peter Collinson, he admitted that he enjoyed the public affection but realized that he should not allow it to go to his head. “The people happen to love me,” he wrote, but then added, “Forgive your friend a little vanity, as it’s only between ourselves…You are now ready to tell me that popular favor is a most uncertain thing. You are right. I blush at having valued myself so much upon it.”<a href="part0030_split_007.html#ch_7_en_25" id="ch_7_een_25"><sup class="calibre7">25</sup></a></span></p>
<h3 class="chapterHeadA">A New Mission</h3>
<p class="para"><span>Franklin’s days as a dexterous politician, one who was willing and able to seek pragmatic compromises in times of crisis, were temporarily over. At the height of earlier tensions, he had enjoyed occasional amiable consultations and social interactions with Governor Morris, but that was no longer the case. Morris and others in the Proprietary faction were doing whatever they could to humiliate him, and for a while he talked of moving to Connecticut or even out west to help start a colony in the Ohio region.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>So his postal inspection trip to Virginia was a welcome respite, one he extended for as long as possible. From Williamsburg he wrote to his wife that he was “as gay as a bird, not beginning yet to long for home, the worry of perpetual business being fresh in my memory.” He met with Colonel Washington and other acquaintances, marveled at the size of the peaches, accepted an honorary degree from William &amp; Mary, and rode through the countryside inspecting postal accounts at a leisurely pace.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>When he finally returned home after more than a month, the atmosphere of Philadelphia was even more polarized. The Proprietors’ secretary, Richard Peters, conspired with William Smith, whom Franklin had recruited to run the Pennsylvania Academy, to oust him from the presidency of that board. Smith had been writing harsh attacks on Franklin, and the two men stopped speaking to each other, another in the line of rifts he had with male friends.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Late that summer of 1756, there was a brief period of hope for restored civility when a professional military man, William Denny, replaced Morris as governor. All sides hastened to greet and embrace him. At his festive inaugural dinner, he took Franklin aside to a private room and tried to cultivate him. Drinking liberally from a decanter of Madeira, Denny profusely flattered Franklin, which was a smart approach, and then tried to bribe him with financial promises, which wasn’t. If Franklin’s opposition abated, Denny promised, he could “depend on adequate acknowledgments and recompenses.” Franklin replied that “my circumstances, thanks to God, were such as to make proprietary favors unnecessary to me.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Denny was less fastidious about financial inducements. Like his predecessor, he confronted the Assembly by rejecting bills that taxed the Proprietary estates, but he later reversed himself, without permission from the Penns, on being offered a generous salary by the Assembly.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>The Assembly, in the meantime, decided that the obstinacy of the Proprietors could no longer be tolerated. In January 1757, the members voted to send Franklin to London as their agent. His goal, at least initially, would be to lobby the Proprietors to be more accommodating to the Assembly over taxation and other matters, and then, if that failed, to take up the Assembly’s cause with the British government.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>Peters, the Proprietors’ secretary, was worried. “B.F.’s view is to effect a change of government,” he wrote Penn in London, “and considering the popularity of his character and the reputation gained by his electricity discoveries, which will introduce him into all sorts of company, he may prove a dangerous enemy.” Penn was more sanguine. “Mr. Franklin’s popularity is nothing here,” he replied. “He will be looked upon coldly by great people.”</span></p>
<p class="para"><span>In fact, Peters and Penn would both turn out to be right. Franklin set sail in June 1757 with the firm belief that the colonists should forge a closer union among themselves and be accorded their full rights and liberties as subjects of the British Crown. But he held these views as a proud and loyal Englishman, one who sought to strengthen his majesty’s empire rather than seek independence for the American colonies. Only much later, after he was indeed looked on coldly by great people in London, would Franklin prove a dangerous enemy to the imperial cause.<a href="part0030_split_007.html#ch_7_en_26" id="ch_7_een_26"><sup class="calibre7">26</sup></a></span></p>
