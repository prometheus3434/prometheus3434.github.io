<p class="para-lsa-supb-pg sans fb_0">Yo, Kelvin,</p>
<p class="para-ltf sans fb_0">What’s new? Haven’t heard from you in a few days. Did you get into the chess club?</p>
<p class="para-lt sans fb_0">What kind of junior high chess club has entrance requirements, anyway? Are they so impacted with applicants they have to turn some away? What, like they don’t have enough chess boards? Only so many tables? Limited number of pocket-protectors?</p>
<p class="para-lt sans fb_0">My school is trying to put me in the gifted classes. Again. Dad totally wants me to go, but why should I? I’m probably just going to be a welder. I don’t need differential calculus to stick pieces of metal together. Sigh…</p>
<p class="para-ltl sans fb_0">Hey, so what happened with Charisse? Did you ask her out? Or talk to her? Or indicate in any way that you exist? Or are you sticking with your brilliant plan to avoid her at all costs?</p>
<p class="para-lsa-alt sans fb_0">Jazz,</p>
<p class="para-ltf sans fb_0">Sorry, I’ve been busy with extracurricular stuff lately. Yes, I got into the chess club. I played several games to establish my skill level and they rated me at 1124. That’s not very good, but I’m studying and practicing to become better. I play against my computer every day and now I’ll get to play against people too.</p>
<p class="para-lt sans fb_0">Why don’t you join the gifted classes? Academic achievement is a great way to honor your parents. You should consider it. I’m sure your father would be very proud. My parents would love it if I could get into the advanced classes. But math is hard. I keep my grades up, but it’s hard.</p>
<p class="para-lt sans fb_0">I have resolve, though. I want to make rockets, and you can’t do that without math.</p>
<p class="para-ltl sans fb_0">No, I haven’t talked to Charisse. I’m sure she wouldn’t be interested in a boy like me. Girls like boys who are big and strong and who beat up other boys. I’m none of those things. If I talked to her, I would just get humiliated.</p>
<p class="para-lsa sans fb_0">Kelvin,</p>
<p class="para-ltf sans fb_0">Dude.</p>
<p class="para-lt sans fb_0">I don’t know where you’re getting info about girls but you’re WRONG. Girls like boys who are nice and make us laugh. We DON’T like boys who get in fights and we don’t like boys who are stupid. Trust me on this. I’m a girl.</p>
<p class="para-lt sans fb_0">Dad has me helping out around the shop. I can solo the simpler jobs. He pays me, which is nice. But he stopped my allowance now that I have an income. So now I’m working for a little bit more than I was getting for free. Not sure I’m on board with that plan but whatever.</p>
<p class="para-lt sans fb_0">Dad’s having problems with the Welders’ Guild. Around here, you can either be freelance or part of the guild. And the guild doesn’t like freelancers. Dad doesn’t have a problem with guilds as a rule, but he says the Welders’ Guild is “mobbed up.” I guess they’re pretty much owned by Saudi organized crime. Why Saudi? I don’t know. Almost all the welders here are Saudis. We’re just the people who ended up controlling the welding industry.</p>
<p class="para-lt sans fb_0">Anyway, the guild forces people to join with bullshit tactics. Not like in movies where they threaten you or anything. Just rumormongering. Floating stories that you’re dishonest and you do shitty work. Stuff like that. But Dad spent his whole life building a reputation. The fake rumors just bounce off. None of his customers believe them.</p>
<p class="para-ltl sans fb_0">Go Dad!</p>
<p class="para-lsa sans fb_0">Jazz,</p>
<p class="para-ltf sans fb_0">That’s too bad about the Welders’ Guild. There are no unions or guilds at KSC. It’s a special administrative zone and the normal laws that help unions don’t apply. KSC has a lot of power in the Kenyan government. There are many special laws for them. But KSC is a boon to all of us and they deserve special treatment. Without them we would be poor like other African countries.</p>
<p class="para-ltl sans fb_0">Have you ever considered moving to Earth? I’m sure you could become a scientist or an engineer and make a lot of money. You’re a citizen of Saudi Arabia, right? They have lots of big corporations there. Lots of jobs for smart people.</p>
<p class="para-lsa sans fb_0">Kelvin,</p>
<p class="para-ltf sans fb_0">Nah. I don’t want to live on Earth. I’m a moon gal. Besides, it would be a huge medical hassle. I’ve been here more than half my life, so my body is used to ⅙th of your gravity. Before I could go to Earth I’d have to do a bunch of exercise and take special pills to stimulate muscle and bone growth. Then I’d have to spend hours every day in a centrifuge…bleh. No thanks.</p>
<p class="para-lt sans fb_0">Talk to Charisse you chickenshit.</p></blockquote></div></body></html>
