<p class="para-lsa-supb-pg sans fb_0">Dear Jazz,</p>
<p class="para-ltf sans fb_0">I’m very worried about you. I haven’t heard from you in over a month. You haven’t answered any of my emails. I found your father’s email address through his welding business website and contacted him. He doesn’t know where you are and he’s very worried too.</p>
<p class="para-ltl sans fb_0">Artemis’s public contact directory has 7 people named Sean. I contacted all of them and none are the Sean who knows you. I guess your Sean didn’t want his information public? Anyway, that was a dead end too.</p>
<p class="para-lsa sans fb_0">Dear Kelvin,</p>
<p class="para-ltf sans fb_0">Sorry you got worried. I wish you hadn’t contacted Dad.</p>
<p class="para-lt sans fb_0">Things have not gone well lately. Last month Sean got a visit from an angry mob. About fifteen guys. They beat the shit out of him. He wouldn’t talk about it afterward, but I knew what it was about. It’s a thing people do here. It’s called a “morals brigade.”</p>
<p class="para-lt sans fb_0">Some things really piss people off. Enough that they’ll form up and punish you, even though you didn’t break any laws. Sean is a horny guy—I knew that. And I knew he had other girls.</p>
<p class="para-lt sans fb_0">But I didn’t know he was screwing a fourteen-year-old.</p>
<p class="para-lt sans fb_0">We’ve got people from all over Earth here. Different cultures have very different sexual morals, so Artemis doesn’t have age-of-consent rules at all. As long as it’s not forced, it’s not rape. And the girl was consenting.</p>
<p class="para-lt sans fb_0">But we’re not savages here. You might not get deported to Earth, but you’ll definitely get your ass kicked. I assume some of those guys were the girl’s relatives. I don’t know.</p>
<p class="para-lt sans fb_0">I’m an idiot, Kelvin. A complete idiot. How could I not see what Sean was? I’m only seventeen and he was hot for me from day one. Turns out I’m on the older end of his preference range.</p>
<p class="para-lt sans fb_0">I’ve got nowhere to stay. I can’t go back to Dad. I just can’t. The fire destroyed all that equipment he’d bought. And he had to pay for the damage to the room itself. Now he can’t expand the business at all. Hell, he can barely keep afloat. How can I go crawling back after doing something like that?</p>
<p class="para-lt sans fb_0">I ruined my father with my stupidity.</p>
<p class="para-lt sans fb_0">And I ruined myself too, by the way. When I walked out on Sean, I had a couple hundred slugs to my name. I couldn’t rent a room with that. I couldn’t even eat proper food.</p>
<p class="para-lt sans fb_0">I’m living on Gunk. Every day. Unflavored, because I can’t afford extracts. And…oh God, Kelvin…I don’t have anywhere to live. I sleep where I can. Areas without a lot of people in them. High floors where it’s godawful hot or low floors where it’s freezing. I stole a blanket from a hotel laundry room just to have something to sleep under. I have to keep moving every night to stay a step ahead of Rudy. It’s against the rules to be homeless. And he’s been <strong class="char-lt-bi">gunning</strong> for me since the fire. He’ll use any excuse he can to get rid of me.</p>
<p class="para-lt sans fb_0">If he catches me I’ll get deported to Saudi Arabia. Then I’ll be broke, homeless, <strong class="char-lt-bi">and</strong> have gravity sickness. I have to stay here.</p>
<p class="para-lt sans fb_0">I’m sorry to dump all this on you. I just don’t have anyone else to talk to.</p>
<p class="para-ltl sans fb_0">Do NOT offer me money. I know that’ll be your first instinct, but don’t. You have four sisters and two parents to take care of.</p>
<p class="para-lsa sans fb_0">Dear Jazz,</p>
<p class="para-ltf sans fb_0">I don’t know what to say. I’m devastated. I wish I could do something for you.</p>
<p class="para-lt sans fb_0">Things haven’t been great here either. My sister Halima announced that she’s pregnant. The father is apparently a military man of some kind and she doesn’t even know his last name. There’s going to be a baby to take care of soon, and it throws a wrench into all our plans. Originally, I was going to pay for Halima’s education, then she’d pay for Kuki’s education while I saved up money for Mom and Dad’s retirement. Then Kuki would pay for Faith’s education and so on. But now Halima won’t be doing anything but taking care of her baby and we’ll have to fund her. Mom got a job as a clerk at a grocery store on the KSC campus. It’s the first job she’s had in her life. She seems to like it, but I wish she didn’t have to work at all.</p>
<p class="para-lt sans fb_0">Dad will have to work many more years. Kuki is now saying she’ll get an unskilled labor job somewhere to bring in money. But she’s selling her future!</p>
<p class="para-lt sans fb_0">We should count our blessings. Halima will be a good mother. And my family will soon have a new child to cherish. We are all healthy and we have each other.</p>
<p class="para-lt sans fb_0">You may be homeless, but at least it’s in the relatively clean, safe streets of Artemis instead of some Earth city. You have a job and are making some money. Hopefully more than you are spending.</p>
<p class="para-lt sans fb_0">Difficult times, my friend, but there is a path. There must be. We will find it. Let me know if there’s anything I can do to help you.</p></blockquote></div></body></html>
