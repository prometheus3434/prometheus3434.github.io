<p class="para-lsa-supb-pg sans fb_0">Dear Jazz,</p>
<p class="para-ltf sans fb_0">Are you all right? I’ve been worried. I haven’t heard from you in a couple of weeks.</p>
<p class="para-lsa sans fb_0">Dear Kelvin,</p>
<p class="para-ltf sans fb_0">Sorry, I had to shut off my Gizmo service for a while to save money. I’ve got it back on now. It’s been tough. But I’m starting to get above water.</p>
<p class="para-lt sans fb_0">I made a new friend. Every now and then I scrape together enough money to get a beer at this hole-in-the-wall in Conrad. I know it’s stupid to spend money on booze when you’re homeless, but booze makes homelessness bearable.</p>
<p class="para-lt sans fb_0">Anyway, there’s a regular there named Dale. He’s an EVA master, mostly working out of the Apollo 11 Visitor Center. He does tourist EVAs, stuff like that.</p>
<p class="para-lt sans fb_0">We got to talking and, I don’t know why, but I ended up telling him my problems. He was shocked at my fucked-up situation and offered to lend me some money. I assumed it was a play to get in my pants so I turned him down. I don’t have a problem with prostitutes, but I don’t want to be one.</p>
<p class="para-lt sans fb_0">But he swore up and down that he just wanted to help me out as a friend. Accepting that money was the hardest thing I’ve ever done, Kelvin. But I was out of options.</p>
<p class="para-lt sans fb_0">Anyway, I had just enough to pay deposit and first month on a capsule domicile. It’s so small I have to step outside to change my mind (rim shot!) but at least it’s a home. And true to his word, Dale never expected anything in return. Perfect gentleman.</p>
<p class="para-lt sans fb_0">And believe it or not I’m even dating a guy. His name is Tyler. It’s early days, but he’s really sweet. He’s kind of shy, polite to everyone, and sort of a Boy Scout when it comes to rules. So the opposite of me in every way. But we really click. We’ll see how it goes.</p>
<p class="para-ltl sans fb_0">You know what? I’ve been selfish lately. I’ve been so focused on me I didn’t even ask about you. How are you handling things?</p>
<p class="para-lsa sans fb_0">Dear Jazz,</p>
<p class="para-ltf sans fb_0">Good for you! I was worried your experience with Sean would put you off men forever. See? We’re not all bad.</p>
<p class="para-lt sans fb_0">I have my job at KSC, for which I’m very grateful. I even got a promotion. I’m a loadmaster-in-training now. In a couple months, I’ll be a full loadmaster and I’ll get a raise.</p>
<p class="para-ltl sans fb_0">Halima is six months pregnant now, and we’re all preparing for the baby. We’ve worked out a rotation so that my other sisters can take care of the baby while Halima stays in school. Mom, Dad, and I will keep working. Dad was almost ready to retire, but now he’ll have to work another five years at least. What choice do we have? There’s just not enough money otherwise.</p>
<p class="para-lsa sans fb_0">Dear Kelvin,</p>
<p class="para-ltf sans fb_0">You’re a loadmaster-in-training? Does that mean you sometimes set up cargo pods unsupervised? Because there are a lot of people in Artemis who smoke.</p>
<p class="para-lsa sans fb_0">Dear Jazz,</p>
<p class="para-ltf sans fb_0">I’m listening…</p></blockquote></div></body></html>
