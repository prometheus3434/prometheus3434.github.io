<p class="para-lsa-supb-pg sans fb_0">Dear Jazz,</p>
<p class="para-ltf sans fb_0">Glad to hear about the sales of the foam insulant. We’re making a killing! I’ll send another two cases in the next probe.</p>
<p class="para-lt sans fb_0">I have a candidate picked out for our “employee.” His name is Jata Masai. He’s a recently hired assistant loader. He’s a friendly man but private. Reclusive. He mentioned he has a wife and two daughters, but that’s about all I know. He never eats lunch with the other loaders in the cafeteria—he brings a lunchbox instead. To me this means he’s short on money.</p>
<p class="para-lt sans fb_0">Wife. Two kids. Needs money. Assistant loader. I like that combo. I haven’t approached him about it yet, obviously. I hired a private investigator to learn everything about him. I’ll send you her report as soon as she delivers it. If you like what you see, I’ll recruit him.</p>
<p class="para-ltl sans fb_0">How are things with Tyler?</p>
<p class="para-lsa sans fb_0">Dear Kelvin,</p>
<p class="para-ltf sans fb_0">Make it two cases of foam insulant. Yes, please send the report on Jata when it’s available.</p>
<p class="para-lt sans fb_0">Tyler and I are done. I don’t want to talk about it.</p></blockquote></div></body></html>
