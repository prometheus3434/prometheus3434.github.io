<p class="center">ABSALOM, ABSALOM!</p>
<p class="nonindent">One of Faulkner’s finest achievements, <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em> is the story of Thomas Sutpen and the ruthless, single-minded pursuit of his grand design—to forge a dynasty in Jefferson, Mississippi, in 1830—which is ultimately destroyed (along with Sutpen himself) by his two sons.</p>
<p class="center">AS I LAY DYING</p>
<p class="nonindent"><em>As I Lay Dying</em> is the harrowing account of the Bundren family’s odyssey across the Mississippi countryside to bury Addie, their wife and mother. Told by each of the family members—including Addie herself—the novel ranges from dark comedy to deepest pathos.</p>
<p class="center">A FABLE</p>
<p class="nonindent">Winner of the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award, this allegorical novel about World War I is set in the trenches of France and deals with a mutiny in a French regiment.</p>
<p class="center">FLAGS IN THE DUST</p>
<p class="nonindent">The complete text, published for the first time in 1973, of Faulkner’s third novel, written when he was twenty-nine, which appeared, with his reluctant consent, in a much cut version in 1929 as <em>Sartoris</em>.</p>
<p class="center">LIGHT IN AUGUST</p>
<p class="nonindent">A novel about hopeful perseverance in the face of mortality, <em>Light in August</em> tells the tales of guileless, dauntless Lena Grove, in search of the father of her unborn child; Reverend Gail Hightower, who is plagued by visions of Confederate horsemen; and Joe Christmas, an enigmatic drifter consumed by his mixed ancestry.</p>
<p class="center">THE REIVERS</p>
<p class="nonindent">One of Faulkner’s comic masterpieces and winner of a Pulitzer Prize, <em>The Reivers</em> is a picaresque tale that tells of three unlikely car thieves from rural Mississippi and their wild misadventures in the fast life of Memphis—from horse smuggling to bawdy houses.</p>
<p class="center">REQUIEM FOR A NUN</p>
<p class="nonindent">The sequel to Faulkner’s most sensational novel <em>Sanctuary</em>, was written twenty years later but takes up the story of Temple Drake eight years after the events related in <em>Sanctuary</em>. Temple is now married to Gowan Stevens. The book begins when the death sentence is pronounced on the nurse Nancy for the murder of Temple and Gowan’s child. In an attempt to save her, Temple goes to see the judge to confess her own guilt. Told partly in prose, partly in play form, <em>Requiem for a Nun</em> is a haunting exploration of the impact of the past on the present.</p>
<p class="center">THE SOUND AND THE FURY</p>
<p class="nonindent">One of the greatest novels of the twentieth century, <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> is the tragedy of the Compson family, featuring some of the most memorable characters in American literature: beautiful, rebellious Caddy; the man-child Benjy; haunted, neurotic Quentin; Jason, the brutal cynic; and Dilsey, their black servant.</p>
<p class="center">THE UNVANQUISHED</p>
<p class="nonindent"><em>The Unvanquished</em> is a novel of the Sartoris family, who embody the ideal of Southern honor and its transformation through war, defeat, and Reconstruction: Colonel John Sartoris, who is murdered by a business rival after the war; his son Bayard, who finds an alternative to bloodshed; and Granny Millard, the matriarch, who must put aside her code of gentility in order to survive.</p>
<p class="center"><em>Snopes Trilogy</em></p>
<p class="center">THE HAMLET</p>
<p class="nonindent"><em>The Hamlet</em>, the first novel of Faulkner’s Snopes trilogy, is both an ironic take on classical tragedy and a mordant commentary on the grand pretensions of the antebellum South and the depths of its decay in the aftermath of war and reconstruction. It tells of the advent and the rise of the Snopes family in Frenchman’s Bend, a small town built on the ruins of a once-stately plantation. Flem Snopes—wily, energetic, a man of shady origins—quickly comes to dominate the town and its people with his cunning and guile.</p>
<p class="center">THE TOWN</p>
<p class="nonindent">This is the second volume of Faulkner’s trilogy about the Snopes family, his symbol for the grasping, destructive element in the post-bellum South. Like its predecessor <em>The Hamlet</em>, and its successor <em>The Mansion, The Town</em> is completely self-contained, but it gains resonance from being read with the other two. The story of Flem Snopes’ ruthless struggle to take over the town of Jefferson, Mississippi, the book is rich in typically Faulknerian episodes of humor and of profundity.</p>
<p class="center">THE MANSION</p>
<p class="nonindent"><em>The Mansion</em> completes Faulkner’s great trilogy of the Snopes family in the mythical county of Yoknapatawpha, Mississippi, which also includes <em>The Hamlet</em> and <em>The Town</em>. Beginning with the murder of Jack Houston and ending with the murder of Flem Snopes, it traces the downfall of the indomitable post-bellum family who managed to seize control of the town of Jefferson within a generation.</p>
<p class="center">BIG WOODS</p>
<p class="nonindent">The best of William Faulkner’s hunting stories are woven together brilliantly in <em>Big Woods</em>. First published in 1955 and now available in paperback for the first time, the volume includes Faulkner’s most famous story, ‘The Bear’ (in its original version), together with ‘The Old People,’ ‘A Bear Hunt,’ and ‘Race at Morning.’ Each of the stories is introduced by a prelude, and the final one is followed by an epilogue, which serve as almost musical bridges between them. Together, these pieces create a seamless whole, a work that displays the full eloquence, emotional breadth, and moral complexity of Faulkner’s vision.</p>
<p class="center">COLLECTED STORIES</p>
<p class="nonindent">‘A Bear Hunt,’ ‘A Rose for Emily,’ ‘Two Soldiers,’ ‘Victory,’ ‘The Brooch,’ ‘Beyond’—these are among the forty-two stories that make up this magisterial collection by the writer who stands at the pinnacle of modern American fiction. Compressing an epic expanse of vision into narratives as hard and wounding as bullets, William Faulkner’s stories evoke the intimate textures of place, the deep strata of history and legend, and all the fear, brutality, and tenderness of which human beings are capable. These tales are set not only in Yoknapatawpha County but in Beverly Hills and in France during World War I; they are populated by such characters as the Faulknerian archetypes Flem Snopes and Quentin Compson (‘A Justice’) as well as ordinary men and women who emerge in these pages so sharply and indelibly that they dwarf the protagonists of most novels.</p>
<p class="center">GO DOWN, MOSES</p>
<p class="nonindent"><em>Go Down, Moses</em> is composed of seven interrelated stories, all of them set in Faulkner’s mythic Yoknapatawpha County. From a variety of perspectives, Faulkner examines the complex, changing relationships between blacks and whites, between man and nature, weaving a cohesive novel rich in implication and insight.</p>
<p class="center">INTRUDER IN THE DUST</p>
<p class="nonindent"><em>Intruder in the Dust</em> is at once engrossing murder mystery and unflinching portrait of racial injustice: it is the story of Lucas Beauchamp, a black man wrongly arrested for the murder of Vinson Gowrie, a white man. Confronted by the threat of lynching, Lucas sets out to prove his innocence, aided by a white lawyer, Gavin Stevens, and his young nephew, Chick Mallison.</p>
<p class="center">KNIGHT’S GAMBIT</p>
<p class="nonindent">Gavin Stevens, the wise and forbearing student of crime and the folk ways of Yoknapatawpha County, Mississippi, plays the major role in these six stories of violence. In each, Stevens’ sharp insights and ingenious detection uncover the underlying motives.</p>
<p class="center">PYLON</p>
<p class="nonindent">One of the few of William Faulkner’s works to be set outside his fictional Yoknapatawpha County, <em>Pylon</em>, first published in 1935, takes place at an air show in a thinly disguised New Orleans named New Valois. An unnamed reporter for a local newspaper tries to understand a very modern <em>ménage a trois</em> of flyers on the brainstorming circuit. These characters, Faulkner said, “were a fantastic and bizarre phenomenon on the face of the contemporary scene.… That is, there was really no place for them in the culture, in the economy, yet they were there, at that time, and everyone knew that they wouldn’t last very long, which they didn’t.… That they were outside the range of God, not only of respectability, of love, but of God too.” In <em>Pylon</em> Faulkner set out to test their rootless modernity to see if there is any place in it for the old values of the human heart that are the central concerns of his best fiction.</p>
<p class="center">SANCTUARY</p>
<p class="nonindent">A powerful novel examining the nature of evil, informed by the works of T.S. Eliot and Freud, mythology, local lore, and hardboiled detective fiction, <em>Sanctuary</em> is the dark, at times brutal, story of the kidnapping of Mississippi debutante Temple Drake, who introduces her own form of venality into the Memphis underworld where she is being held.</p>
<p class="center">THREE FAMOUS SHORT NOVELS</p>
<p class="nonindent">In this book are three different approaches of Faulkner, each of them highly entertaining as well as representative of his work as a whole. <em>Spotted Horses</em> is a hilarious account of a horse auction, and pits the ‘cold practicality’ of women against the boyish folly of men. The law comes in to settle the dispute caused by the sale of “wild” horses, and finds itself up against a formidable opponent, Mrs. Tull. <em>Old Man</em> is something of an adventure story. When a flood ravages the countryside of the lower Mississippi, a convict finds himself adrift with a pregnant woman. His one aim is to return the woman to safety and himself to prison, where he can be free of women. In order to do this, he fights alligators and snakes, as well as the urge to be trapped once again by a woman. Perhaps one of the best known of Faulkner’s shorter works, <em>The Bear</em> is the story of a boy coming to terms with the adult world. By learning how to hunt, the boy is taught the real meaning of pride and humility and courage, virtues that Faulkner feared would be almost impossible to learn with the destruction of the wilderness.</p>
<p class="center">UNCOLLECTED STORIES OF WILLIAM FAULKNER</p>
<p class="nonindent">This invaluable volume, which has been republished to commemorate the one-hundredth anniversary of Faulkner’s birth, contains some of the greatest short fiction by a writer who defined the course of American literature. Its forty-five stories fall into three categories: those not included in Faulkner’s earlier collections; previously unpublished short fiction; and stories that were later expanded into such novels as <em>The Unvanquished, The Hamlet</em>, and <em>Go Down, Moses</em>. With its introduction and extensive notes by the biographer Joseph Blotner, <em>Uncollected Stories of William Faulkner</em> is an essential addition to its author’s canon—as well as a book of some of the most haunting, harrowing, and atmospheric short fiction written in this century.</p>
<p class="center">THE WILD PALMS</p>
<p class="nonindent">In this feverishly beautiful novel—originally titled <em>If I Forget Thee, Jerusalem</em> by Faulkner, and now published in the authoritative Library of America text—William Faulkner interweaves two narratives, each wholly absorbing in its own right, each subtly illuminating the other. In New Orleans in 1937, a man and a woman embark on a headlong flight into the wilderness of passions, fleeing her husband and the temptations of respectability. In Mississippi ten years earlier, a convict sets forth across a flooded river, risking his one chance at freedom to rescue a pregnant woman. From these separate stories Faulkner composes a symphony of deliverance and damnation, survival and self-sacrifice, a novel in which elemental danger juxtaposes with fatal injuries of the spirit. <em>The Wild Palms</em> is grandly inventive, heart-stopping in its prose, and suffused on every page with the physical presence of the country that Faulkner made his own.<br/><br/><br/><br/></p>
