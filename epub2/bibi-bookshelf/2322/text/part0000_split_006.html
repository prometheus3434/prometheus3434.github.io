   <p class="calibre7"> <span class="calibre6"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“You lot need to keep moving,” a gruff voice shouted.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza was disoriented from the sudden change in scenery and observed the area around her cautiously.  She was now standing in a small courtyard with a large group of other players.  Each person wore a homespun cotton shirt and trousers.  They also seemed equally dumbstruck at being suddenly dropped in a new location.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Are you all dumb or deaf?” the surly person shouted again.  “Get your asses moving!”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza pushed at her glasses with her finger – the one item that she hadn’t lost upon entering the game – and looked toward the source of the yelling.  A portly man wearing heavy leather armor was gesturing toward the entrance to the courtyard while watching the players in irritation.  A longsword dangled from his hip, the hilt gleaming in the sunlight.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Not wanting to cause a scene, Eliza decided to listen to the surly man.  She moved forward, slinking past the other milling players and guards without making eye contact.  As soon as she stepped through the entrance to the courtyard, a multi-colored tear formed in the air behind her and another group of confused players appeared in the courtyard with a small popping sound.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre21">Is this a starting area?</span><span class="calibre6"> she wondered.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza soon found herself slowly moving along a cobblestone street behind a group of other new players.  The milling throng of people all wearing the same clothing made for an odd sight, drawing looks from the local townsfolk – who she assumed were NPCs.  She had been deposited by the Hippie in what appeared to be some sort of medieval town.  The structures around her were made of wood and towered three and four stories into the air.  They were all connected at various points by crisscrossing platforms and staircases.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“So, what do we want to do first?” a young man ahead of her asked his group.  “Maybe stop by the training grounds or should we go pick a profession?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“I’m planning to go get some combat training,” the girl beside him replied.  “I’ve heard a bunch of horror stories about players just running out of the starting town and immediately getting owned by a group of monsters.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Another player snorted.  “How hard could it be?  It’s just another game.  Besides, I hate tutorials.  I say we skip it.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“I don’t know… I heard combat feels pretty realistic,” the first speaker added.  “That’s why everyone else here is heading to the training grounds.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza didn’t exactly share their optimism about learning combat skills.  And she definitely didn’t have any interest in becoming some sort of warrior – or in fighting monsters for that matter.  At the next fork in the road, she turned away from the group, heading further into the interior of the city.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">A few minutes later, her wanderings found her on the far edge of town.  Her breath caught in her throat at the sight that awaited her.  The city had been built on a cliff face overlooking a bay.  Sunlight sparkled off the water far below her.  Wooden ramps and makeshift lifts led down the side of the cliff, terminating in a dock below where dozens of ships swayed gently in the water.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“This is a port city?” Eliza murmured.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Aye lass,” a voice said from beside her.  “This is Falcon’s Hook.  Didn’t they explain that in the courtyard where you appeared?”  She turned and found an old man resting against the railing, eyeing her clothing skeptically.  He wore a coarse robe and a cane rested against his leg.  “You </span><span class="calibre21">are</span><span class="calibre6"> a traveler, aren’t you?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza looked down at her hands as she replied, “The man in the beginning courtyard was a bit gruff.  He didn’t explain much of anything.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Well, I can help you there,” the man replied happily, gesturing at the bay.  “This here is one of the largest ports on the Silver Coast.  We have a thriving market since we’re a stopping point for merchants traveling north and south along the coast.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">He gestured back the way Eliza had come.  “Most of the new travelers head to the training grounds near the city’s gate.  They have you lot beat on some stuffed mannequins and such until you’re ready for bigger game.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Is… is there somewhere else I could go?” Eliza asked.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The man eyed her carefully.  “Not looking forward to swinging a sword, huh?  That’s not a problem.  There’s room for all sorts here.  Maybe you should consider checking out the market.  Just head north – you can’t miss it.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">He chuckled.  “If you fall off the cliff, you’ve gone too far.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza smiled slightly.  “Thank you,” she said quietly before turning to head off along the ledge that circled the eastern part of the city.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">A few minutes later, Eliza found the market.  Rather, she assumed it must be a market.  There wasn’t exactly a sign, but the massive throng of people milling between brightly-colored booths was a dead giveaway.  Uncertain what to do, she drifted between the stalls, inspecting the various goods people were selling as merchants shouted out information regarding their wares.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Her brow wrinkled in concentration as she stopped in front of one booth.  This merchant was selling various weapons, the equipment laid out on wooden tables and racks.  As Eliza took note of one particular item, status information was displayed alongside the weapon.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre7"> <span class="calibre6"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre32"> <span class="calibre19">Common Longsword</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre32"> <span class="calibre6">An ordinary but effective weapon and a staple among adventurers.  You notice some rust along the blade and nicks in the steel that indicate it has not been properly repaired or maintained.  There may be a risk that the blade will crack or chip during battle.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre32"> <span class="calibre19">Quality:  </span><span class="calibre6">D</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre32"> <span class="calibre19">Damage:</span><span class="calibre6">  9-19 (Slash)</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre32"> <span class="calibre19">Durability:</span><span class="calibre6">  12/20</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre7"> <span class="calibre6"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Looking for a sword, girl?” a brawny merchant asked from behind the counter.  “We have the best quality goods on the Silver Coast.”  He tapped his finger along the steel.  “See the polish on this one?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“I’m okay,” Eliza said quietly, moving further down the booths.  She was thinking about the prompt she had seen.  She wasn’t the sort of person that knew much about swords, so how had she noticed the imperfections in the blade?  She could only surmise that it must have something to do with her </span><span class="calibre21">Identification</span><span class="calibre6"> skill.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Another few booths down, she came to a complete stop, her eyes widening in surprise.  She approached this new stand slowly.  The stall was filled with heaping crates and tables piled with dried herbs and plants she had never seen before.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">On one table, she noticed a potted plant with serpent-like tendrils and vines – some of which actually had serpent heads attached.  She also saw an assortment of multi-colored fungi that she had never seen before.  As she approached the plants, a vine lashed out at her.  Before it touched her skin, an older woman whacked the tendril away with a stick.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“You should be careful,” the woman said, scowling at the offending plant.  “Some of the specimens here, especially the live ones, are a little aggressive.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“What’s that plant?” Eliza asked, eyeing the shrub in shock.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“That’s Lash Root.  Good for making Stamina Potions.  It’s just a bit difficult to harvest if you know what I mean.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“And this one here?” Eliza asked, pointing at a mushroom with a white stem and a bright red bulb.  She could see faint yellow dots across the crown of the mushroom.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“That’s Hog Stool.  I know it’s not the most pleasant name, but, ironically, it’s quite useful for making Clarity Potions.”  She tapped her forehead as she took a seat on a nearby stool.  “It gives the user a bit of a boost to their brain power.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza observed the fungi carefully, and a notice appeared in the air beside it.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre7"> <span class="calibre6"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre32"> <span class="calibre19">Hog Stool</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre32"> <span class="calibre6">This odd-looking mushroom has a number of useful applications.  You are currently only aware of one use involving the creation of Clarity Potions.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre32"> <span class="calibre19">Quality:  </span><span class="calibre6">C</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre32"> <span class="calibre19">Side Effects: </span><span class="calibre6"> Mild-to-moderate hallucinations.  Other effects unknown.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre7"> <span class="calibre6"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza pushed her glasses further back on her nose as she read the notification.  It was strange that she was able to detect possible side effects of the plant, but she assumed it must be another aspect of her </span><span class="calibre21">Identification</span><span class="calibre6"> skill.  It seemed that the skill was going to be quite useful afterall.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Are you interested in herbalism?” the woman asked, noting the way that Eliza had been eyeing her plants and herbs carefully.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“I’m not certain what you mean, but I enjoy gardening,” Eliza replied in a soft voice.  “I’ve just never seen any of these plants before.  They’re… interesting.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The old woman seemed to consider something for a moment before sticking out her hand toward Eliza.  “My name’s Alma,” she said as Eliza tentatively took her hand.  “I have a small garden and alchemy lab outside of town, and I just so happen to be looking for a new apprentice.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Alma glanced aside for a moment, and Eliza could have sworn the older woman grumbled something about poisons and comas.  “Anyway, you seem like you might have an interest in the trade.  What do you say, girl?  Would you like to come work for me?  It doesn’t pay well, but I could teach you a thing or two.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza’s eyes widened.  For some reason, the offer deeply appealed to her.  It was definitely a better option than learning how to swing a sword, anyway.  She nodded her head.  “I would love to,” she replied.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Good.  Good,” Alma said, waving a hand absently before glancing up at the sun.  Eliza noticed that it was starting to drift toward the horizon.  “We’re almost done for the day, so why don’t you help me pack up and lug this stuff back to my house.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">As Eliza moved to help the older woman, a blue notice appeared in front of her.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre7"> <span class="calibre6"> </span> </p> 
   <div class="calibre23">

   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">This hadn’t been what Eliza was expecting when she logged into Awaken Online, but somehow it felt fitting.  If she were being honest with herself, she was actually a little excited to learn more from Alma.  It was the first time she had felt that sensation in a long time.</span> </p>
