   <p class="calibre7"> <span class="calibre6"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza blinked rapidly as blinding light flooded her vision.  As her eyes adjusted, she realized she was now standing in a fantastic garden.  Sunlight streamed into the enclosure, gleaming off the emerald, dew-studded leaves of the hedges that ringed the courtyard.  Rose bushes lined the space in neat rows and the pink, red, and white blossoms stood out vividly.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza looked up, covering her eyes to blot out the sun.  She could see puffy white clouds drifting languidly through a crystalline blue sky.  Insects chirped happily inside the garden, and the warm sunlight lingered on her skin.  Rubbing her arm, she realized that she could actually feel the sensation, her sense of touch almost indistinguishable from real life.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“This is a game?” she whispered to herself.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">After she had a chance to collect her thoughts, Eliza inspected the courtyard more closely.  The rigid branches of the rose bushes had intertwined to form a flat table-like surface above each of the rows.  On these tables rested all manner of objects.  Although, </span><span class="calibre21">junk</span><span class="calibre6"> might have been a more accurate description.  Eliza strolled down the nearest row, eying the tables skeptically.  A sword.  A handkerchief.  A harp.  A lamp.  There didn’t seem to be any rhyme or reason to the motley collection.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">After walking up and down several of the aisles, Eliza finally came to a stop.  What was she supposed to do in this garden?  What was the point of this?</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“There really isn’t much of a point to anything, is there?  Silly question if you ask me,” said a voice.  Eliza jumped in surprise and whirled, trying to find the speaker.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“But, of course, you didn’t ask me, did you?” the voice continued with a note of amusement.  Eliza could distinctly hear that the sound came from the end of the row of bushes.  Stepping forward carefully, she peered around the edge of the table.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">A young man lay on the ground, his eyes closed.  He must have been in his mid-twenties.  Thick stubble covered his chin, and his clothes appeared to be made of a chaotic collection of multi-colored rags.  Rough sandals adorned his feet, and their straps crisscrossed up his calves.  The man’s head rested against an enormous woolen object that appeared to be an over-sized pillow.  Eliza couldn’t help but think that he looked like one of the people in her history books – particularly from the 1970s.  He looked a bit like either a hippie or, quite possibly, a homeless person.  She couldn’t decide which.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“It’s rude to stare,” the young man said without opening his eyes.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“I…I’m sorry,” Eliza replied.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“It’s even more rude to judge someone you’ve just met,” he continued, peeking at her with one half-lidded eye.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“But I didn’t…” Eliza trailed off and then realized she hadn’t actually spoken.  She had only been thinking he looked homeless.  The Hippie had also picked up on her thoughts earlier when she had wondered about the point of the garden.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Wait.  Can you read my mind?” Eliza asked in confusion.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Such as it is, I suppose.  I’ve never given it much thought,” he said, yawning widely.  “If not for you thinking so </span><span class="calibre21">loudly</span><span class="calibre6">, I would have continued to nap here.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Um, well… I’m sorry?” Eliza replied, unsure if thinking was something she should really be apologizing for.  She could only guess that the man must be part of the game world if he was able to pick up on her thoughts.  She glanced around at the garden.  “What is this place?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Great question.  </span><span class="calibre21">This</span><span class="calibre6"> is a garden,” the Hippie replied with a deadpan expression.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza just stared at him for a few seconds before trying again.  “What I mean is where is this garden located?  Are we in the game?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The hippie sighed and looked at his fluffy black pillow mournfully.  “I guess a nap is out of the question now.  That second question is a tricky one.  Isn’t everything a game?  Or a test, or a quiz, or a trial?”  He tapped his chin thoughtfully.  “Life’s a game I suppose.  We just don’t understand the rules.  Deep, huh?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Are you being deliberately difficult?” Eliza asked, exasperation coloring her voice.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">A wide smile crept across the Hippie’s face.  “Not deliberately, no.  You’ll just have to accept that it’s part of my nature.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">He stretched his arms over his head and then looked at Eliza appraisingly again.  “In this case, the rules are simple.  Pick an object.  Any object.”  He waved at the rows of tables behind Eliza dismissively.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“To what end?” Eliza inquired.  She wasn’t sure she understood the point of this game – if that was even what this was about.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The Hippie rubbed at his chin.  “Now that’s another good question.  I think there’s some significant disagreement about the answer.  Live for the sake of living?  Seems a bit circular to me.  Life is the pursuit of happiness?  That one seems rather vague.  What is </span><span class="calibre21">happiness</span><span class="calibre6"> anyway?  I’ve asked the Gambler many times, and he refuses to give me a straight answer.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">He sighed wistfully before continuing.  “Then there are the spiritual and religious interpretations, but I understand there’s some disagreement there.  Or maybe it’s all just a big toss-up.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The Hippie shook his head.  “Seems like there are too many options and no clear answers.  See?  This is why I choose to nap.  Much more comforting than all of these pesky questions.”  The hippie turned to his pillow and asked, “Wouldn’t you agree, Fluffy?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza was just about to ask another question – this time focused on the young man’s sanity – when she saw the pillow move.  It rose onto four legs and turned to face the Hippie, its sleepy eyes observing him carefully.  Eliza immediately realized she was looking at a sheep.  A very black sheep.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The sheep – whose name must be Fluffy – let out a bleat and licked the Hippie’s face.  “See!” the Hippie said to Eliza, “Fluffy always enjoys our naps.  Much more relaxing than these in-depth philosophical questions you keep asking.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The sheep shuffled over to Eliza and inspected her cautiously.  She reflexively reached out a hand and petted him absently as she looked at the pair in confusion.  What on earth was going on here?  Was she really playing Awaken Online?  Who was this crazy young man and his black sheep?</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">She tried to collect her thoughts.  She was just starting the game, so this must be some type of initiation or starting area.  She had heard enough from listening to her classmates to know that the character creation process in the game was a little unusual.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“If I choose an item from the garden, then I can leave?” Eliza asked carefully.  Maybe if she completed whatever this was, she could move on to the real game.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Yep.  Just pick an object.”  Then the young man hesitated.  “There was something important about the item, though.”  After a moment he shrugged.  “It probably isn’t a big deal.  Let us know when you’ve made your selection!”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Fluffy licked Eliza’s hand appreciatively and then laid back down.  The Hippie rested his head back against the sheep’s stomach, and the pair promptly closed their eyes.  Within seconds, she could hear soft snoring sounds coming from them.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza closed her eyes too – except she was attempting to suppress her frustration.  She took a deep breath and then glanced around the garden.  She began walking back between the rows of tables and re-examining the objects that littered their surfaces in large piles.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">From the Hippie’s ramblings, she was guessing that the items were important.  They probably determined how she would start out in the game world.  A sword for a fighting character, woodworking tools for a crafter, etc.  Although she saw a number of items that made her think twice about her hypothesis.  For example, she found a spoon on one table – just a spoon.  On another, she found a small pocket watch.  That punched some holes in her theory, but it was the best she had to go on.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza spent a considerable amount of time walking between the tables and examining each object carefully.  After what felt like hours, she was rewarded with a blue skill notification:</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre7"> <span class="calibre6"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre32"> <span class="calibre33">New Passive Skill:  Identification</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre32"> <span class="calibre34">You have spent a long time looking at various items.  And we mean a </span><span class="calibre35">long</span><span class="calibre34"> time.  The result is that you are better able to observe the traits of objects you find.  At higher levels, you may be able to discover hidden traits of items and monsters.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre32"> <span class="calibre33">Skill Level:</span><span class="calibre34">  Beginner Level 1</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre32"> <span class="calibre33">Effect:</span><span class="calibre34">  Allows the user to identify unknown objects or reveal hidden information.  Higher levels increase the information that is revealed.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre7"> <span class="calibre34"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The skill was interesting, but it didn’t help with her current problem.  She had no idea which object to pick.  None of the items appealed to her.  They were all either silly, useless, or felt like they would come with tradeoffs.  Uncertain what to do, Eliza made her way back to the corner of the garden where she had found the Hippie.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">She discovered him still nestled up to Fluffy, a little drool pooling at the corner of his mouth.  Eliza coughed in an attempt to wake the man.  When that didn’t work, she coughed a little louder.  Still nothing.  Then she sighed and sat down with her back to one of the hedges that ringed the garden.  Her thoughts were somewhat morose.  Even in a game, she had no idea what she wanted to do.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Her gaze drifted across a nearby rose bush.  The leaves of this shrub were beginning to turn brown and looked dry.  She plucked a leaf, pressing it between her fingers.  It promptly crumbled under her touch.  Then she stuck her finger into the soil beneath the plant and noticed it was extremely damp.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">She glanced at the Hippie.  “You’re over watering your garden,” she muttered.  “This plant looks like it has root rot.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The young man’s eyes shot open, and he sat up.  “You know what?  That’s a great point.  Are you a gardener yourself?”  Fluffy stirred restlessly and then glared at the Hippie with an accusing expression.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza looked at him in surprise, taken aback by his reaction.  “I-I guess so.  I have a small garden of my own.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The young man looked at her carefully.  “Interesting.  Interesting.  You know what?  You would be perfect.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Um.  Perfect for what?”  Eliza asked cautiously.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The Hippie spread his arms wide.  “For my trail of course!  Wait, no.  That’s not it.  Road?  Boulevard?  Aisle?”  He glanced at his sheep.  “Do you remember, Fluffy?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The sheep gave the Hippie a long-suffering look and bleated softly in response.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Ahh, I’ve got it.  My </span><span class="calibre21">path</span><span class="calibre6">.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“What about your path?” Eliza asked in confusion.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“You would be perfect for it,” he replied with a wave of his hand.  “Didn’t I say that?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">She suppressed another sigh.  “No.  I mean yes. You did, but what is your path?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“The Path of Water, of course,” the Hippie explained with a wide grin.  He scooted around so that he was sitting beside her, and then nudged Eliza with his elbow conspiratorially.  “It’s supposed to be a secret, but it’s about acceptance.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza started to ask him what on earth he was talking about and then just shook her head.  It wouldn’t help to keep asking him questions when she knew he was incapable of giving her a straight answer.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Uh, I think I’m okay,” she said and started to edge away from him.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“You’re better than okay!” the Hippie replied.  “Here, I’ll show you!”  With a wave of his hand, a notification abruptly appeared in Eliza’s vision.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre7"> <span class="calibre6"> </span> </p>

    </table> 
   </div> 
   <p class="calibre7"> <span class="calibre6"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza just stared at the notification, not certain how to respond to the strange prompt.  She had gained the attention of the “Great Black Sheep?”  Was that this strange homeless man beside her or Fluffy?  Or both?</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“I don’t think you understand,” Eliza began.  “I don’t really…”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The Hippie interrupted her, “This is a great honor.  You should be </span><span class="calibre21">honored</span><span class="calibre6">.  Shouldn’t she, Fluffy?”  The sheep snorted and didn’t bother looking up this time.  “See, Fluffy approves too!”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“But I don’t…” Eliza tried again.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“…know how to get started.  Don’t worry!  I’ve got you covered.”  With that, the young man waved his hand and the game world around Eliza began to disintegrate.  “Toodles!”  He called out before the world went dark again.</span> </p>
