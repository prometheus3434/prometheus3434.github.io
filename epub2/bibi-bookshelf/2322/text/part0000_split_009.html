   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre19"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza trudged down the road, muttering to herself under her breath.  She wasn’t certain who would design a game where the gods could pigeonhole a player into following one path.  She had considered simply returning to Alma’s house.  However, the Hippie had promised he would let her re-enter the city if she completed his task.  In the long run, she needed access to the city to buy supplies and run errands, so she had decided to play along.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">For now.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">At least, the god had been “kind” enough to mark the quest location on her map.  Apparently, she was supposed to head a few miles west of Falcon’s Hook.  As she walked, the tree cover began to thicken, only the occasional beam of sunlight managing to penetrate the blanket of leaves that hung overhead.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The number of players and NPCs had begun to thin out.  A few hours ago, one player had stopped her, eyeing her equipment skeptically.  He had warned her that the creatures in the deeper parts of the forest were much more difficult.  She had grumbled something incoherent about black sheep and homeless gods and, ignoring his warnings, she had kept walking.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">It wasn’t like she would fare well against even the lower-level creatures in-game.  She hadn’t been in combat at all, even after a week spent inside of AO.  Eliza had the two offensive spells the Hippie had given her when she received her class change, but she hadn’t had much need to use them in the garden.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza glanced at her in-game clock.  She would need to log out soon to fix dinner for her parents.  However, her map indicated that she was getting close to the quest location.  She might as well see what she was up against first.  As she rounded a bend in the road, she saw a massive bridge ahead of her.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Nearing the bridge, Eliza realized that the structure overhung a gorge.  The chasm dropped nearly a hundred feet, and a river ran along the ravine far below.  Likely, the water had cut a path through the stone over time on its way to the coast to the east.  She pushed at her glasses as she observed the gorge.  She could see a narrow trail that wound its way down the ledge to her right, but she wasn’t anxious to attempt the path.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The bridge was a considerable structure, spanning a few dozen yards.  It appeared to have been built of a mixture of rough-hewn rock and wood.  Massive columns of stone lanced down from the bottom of the bridge, embedding themselves in the gorge far below.  At first glance, Eliza wasn’t certain that the bridge had been built by mundane means.  The stones almost appeared to blend together – possibly indicating that magic had been used to construct it.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">She pulled up her map to see if she was getting close to her destination.  She discovered that the quest marker illuminated the whole area nearby – which wasn’t exactly helpful.  Not that she was surprised, of course.  With a sigh, she decided to continue past the bridge.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">When she was nearly halfway across, she felt the entire structure shake.  Eliza froze.  She could hear the sound of pounding coming from the side of the bridge, each thump causing the structure to shudder dangerously.  The reverberations were becoming louder, as though something was climbing the bridge.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Edging away from the noise, her back soon pressed against the railing on the far side of the structure.  She wasn’t sure whether to run or not, her eyes darting to either end of the gorge.  Should she head back the way she came?</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The decision was made for her a moment later as a grotesque head appeared over the lip of the railing on the other side of the bridge, swiftly followed by the creature’s enormous body.  The monster had four arms and two legs and was covered in a rough leathery hide.  Its skin almost appeared to be made of stone the way the creature’s limbs were cobbled together at hard angles.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The monster’s glowing green eyes drifted across the bridge before settling on Eliza’s cowering form.  A growl rumbled in its chest.  “Another traveler…” it said, its voice hoarse.  It formed the words awkwardly as though unaccustomed to speaking.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">It didn’t seem that the creature planned to attack her immediately and so Eliza tried to tamp down on her fear.  She knew this wasn’t real, but that didn’t change the fact that she was being confronted by an eight-foot-tall monster.  She decided to use her </span><span class="calibre21">Identification</span><span class="calibre6"> skill.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre7"> <span class="calibre6"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre32"> <span class="calibre34">Mountain Troll – Level 76 (Boss)</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre32"> <span class="calibre34">Health – Unknown</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre32"> <span class="calibre34">Mana – Unknown</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre32"> <span class="calibre34">Equipment – Unknown</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre32"> <span class="calibre34">Resistances – Unknown</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre7"> <span class="calibre34"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre21">Holy crap</span><span class="calibre6">… she thought.  </span><span class="calibre21">Level 76?  And it’s some kind of boss creature?</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza had realized early on that the </span><span class="calibre21">Identification</span><span class="calibre6"> skill she had picked up in the Hippie’s garden was extremely useful.  First, it wasn’t limited to objects.  Second, while she didn’t always learn all of the details about the object she identified, she seemed to gain more information than most players.  It had come in handy when working in Alma’s garden, which she was sorely missing right now.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“W-what do you want?” Eliza managed to stutter.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Toll,” the troll growled at her, lifting its arms with its four palms facing upward.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza’s eyes widened.  “I don’t have any money,” she said.  Which was true.  She had never asked Alma for money, and she had immediately spent any coin the woman gave her on Alchemy tools and books.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Toll,” the troll demanded more forcefully, standing up straighter and taking a ponderous step forward.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Desperate, Eliza dug into her bag in search of something to hand the troll.  All she had were various plants and ingredients and a motley assortment of novice potions.  Deciding she had nothing to lose, she grabbed one of her better healing potions and lifted it toward the troll.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Will this work?” she asked, her voice quavering.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The troll plucked the small vial from her hand, lifting it up to his eye to examine its contents.  “Not shiny,” it growled, turning his glowing green eyes back to Eliza.  “No toll, then die.”  The troll began to step toward the girl.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza backpedaled, uncertain what to do.  Her mind wheeled in panic.  As the troll began to approach, she turned and tried to run.  Her feet slapped frantically against the stone bridge as she raced toward the edge of the gorge.  She could feel the pounding behind her intensify.  Then her legs toppled out from under her.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">She slammed into the bridge hard, the wind quickly evacuating her lungs.  She tried to roll over, but a crushing weight descended upon her before she had a chance to react.  Pain lanced through her body before the world abruptly went dark.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">A prompt appeared in Eliza’s vision.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre7"> <span class="calibre6"> </span> </p> 
   <div class="calibre23"> 
    <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="1" class="calibre24"> 
     <tbody class="calibre25">
      <tr class="calibre26">

       <td class="calibre28"> <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre6"> </span> </p> <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre6">You have died. </span> </p> <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre6"> </span> </p> <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre6">Thanks for playing Awaken Online!</span> </p> <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre6"> </span> </p> </td> 
      </tr> 
     </tbody>
    </table> 
   </div> 
   <p class="calibre7"> <span class="calibre6"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">A moment later, Eliza was once again standing on the bridge.  She was disoriented by the sudden change in perspective, and it took her a moment to get her bearings.  As she looked around, she noticed that the world had taken on a washed-out appearance and blue motes of energy hung in the air around her.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">She saw her small form huddled against the railing of the bridge and she gasped.  What was this?  The troll again lumbered over the edge, its ugly visage leering at her evilly.  The recent exchange played out again, this time with Eliza watching her panicked fearful reaction to the situation and her half-assed attempt to run away.  She glanced away as she saw the troll smash her fragile body, her blood staining the stone of the bridge.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“This is impossible,” she muttered.  “How am I supposed to defeat a troll?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Troll?” a familiar voice asked from beside her.  She glanced over to see the Hippie leaning casually against the edge of the bridge, Fluffy lying peacefully at his feet.  As the troll’s head reappeared over the ledge for the third time, the young man’s eyes widened.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Oh, I totally forgot about the troll,” he said.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“You forgot?” Eliza asked with a deadpan expression.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Yep, completely slipped my mind,” the Hippie replied in a chagrined tone.  “But I remember the story now.  He stole the item of immense power.”  He added this last part with a little flourish.  “But it’s okay.  I’m sure you can handle this just fine.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“How can I handle this?  That creature is nearly four times my level, and it killed me in one hit.  Besides, I don’t even know what I’m supposed to be looking for to complete your dumb quest.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The Hippie looked offended and put his hands over Fluffy’s ears.  “Shh.  This quest was Fluffy’s idea.  You’ll upset him.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Then the young man cocked his head and glanced at the troll as he demanded a toll from Eliza.  “Although now that I think about it, the whole troll toll thing is a little cliché.”  He glanced down at Fluffy before continuing in a whisper, “But we don’t need to tell him that.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza closed her eyes and forced herself to take a deep breath.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“As soon as I respawn, I’m going back to Alma’s house,” she finally said.  “I don’t care if you’ve blocked my access to Falcon’s Hook.  I can just spend more time in her garden.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“But what about the quest?” the Hippie exclaimed.  “Remember?  We need to recover the item of vital importance.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“I don’t care,” Eliza said.  “I’m going back.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The Hippie looked sad.  “I was hoping you wouldn’t say that.  I’ll just have to use more of my mojo to motivate you I suppose.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“What are you talking about…?” Eliza began, but then stopped as she watched the Hippie go through another odd series of arm waving.  “Wait… don’t…”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">But it was already too late.  The world abruptly went dark.  When she came to, Eliza found that she had respawned and was standing at the entrance to the bridge.  The Hippie and Fluffy were nowhere to be found.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Damn, stupid god,” Eliza muttered.  She had no idea what spell he had cast this time, but she didn’t plan to stick around and find out.  She promptly turned and started back down the road toward Falcon’s Hook.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">After a few minutes of walking, Eliza turned a bend in the road and stopped abruptly.  A few yards ahead of her was the familiar stone bridge.  She adjusted her glasses and pondered for a moment whether she had accidentally looped around somehow.  Maybe she had taken a wrong turn.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Shaking her head, she turned around and walked back down the trail.  Another few minutes passed, and she again found herself in front of the bridge.  One time was an accident, two times meant that a meddling, idiot god was involved.  Eliza could feel her frustration mounting.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“I’m not going to do your stupid quest,” she shouted, her voice echoing down through the chasm.  “You can take your item and shove it up your…”  Eliza was interrupted by a cough from behind her, and she whirled, finding a group of players looking at her with confused expressions.  A skinny mage leaned over and whispered to his friend while eyeing her suspiciously.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“It-it’s not what it looks like,” Eliza muttered, her eyes downcast.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The players didn’t bother to answer, edging past her and starting across the bridge.  She briefly considered warning them about the troll, but what was the point?  They would probably just ignore her.  Not that she could blame them.  She probably wouldn’t take any advice from a crazy girl screaming at a bridge.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza headed to the side of the road and sat down on a log, pondering what she was going to do next.  She liked playing AO.  It was relaxing as long as the Hippie wasn’t meddling.  But if she wanted to return to Alma’s garden, she was going to have to find a way to retrieve the item the troll stole.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">As the players’ screams rang through the crevasse beside her, she tapped her fingers to her lips in thought.  She was going to need a plan.</span> </p>
