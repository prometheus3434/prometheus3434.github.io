   <p class="calibre7"> <span class="calibre6"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza stared at the small petri dish resting on the workbench.  She had placed a Carnivore Mold culture on top of the dish and was now preparing to try her new </span><span class="calibre21">Accelerated Growth</span><span class="calibre6"> spell.  Taking a deep breath, she channeled her mana.  Power immediately rushed through her veins in a river, and she instinctively funneled the energy toward her fingertip.  She watched, mesmerized, as a single drop of mana formed along her finger and then dripped down onto the mold.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">She held her breath expectantly.  However, as the seconds passed, nothing happened.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza frowned, a confused flurry of thoughts whipping through her head.  Had she messed up the spell somehow?  Or maybe the mold was resistant to the growth spell?  She looked back at the prompt, wondering if maybe she wasn’t experienced enough to cast the spell.  However, at this stage, she was now intimately familiar with the mold, so that didn’t seem likely.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">As she stared back and forth between the potted plant that Alma had used as an example and the mold culture, it suddenly occurred to her what she was missing.  Eliza felt like face-palming.  She hadn’t given the mold anything to feed on!</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">She leaped up from her chair and raced to the other side of the room, returning a moment later with a few of the pellets that she used to feed the rabbits.  She dropped a single pellet in the middle of the mold culture, watching as the substance clung to the organic matter and began to feed on it slowly.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Taking another breath, she then repeated the spell.  This time, the mold responded as soon as the glowing blue drop splashed against its surface.  The mold grew at an alarming pace, immediately covering the pellet and expanding to fill the entire dish.  Eliza quickly canceled the spell as she saw that the mold would soon overgrow its little enclosure.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Whatcha doing?” a voice suddenly spoke up near her shoulder.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza let out an alarmed squeak and promptly fell off of her stool, landing heavily on the floor.  The Hippie’s smiling face loomed over her, his head cocked to the side inquisitively.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“No need to get up on my account,” he said with some amusement.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Fluffy trotted into view a moment later, sniffing at Eliza with a compassionate expression.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Groaning softly, she managed to push herself back to a sitting position – sparing a moment to glare daggers at the irritating god.  “You don’t need to pop into existence right beside me like that,” she muttered.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">He waved a hand.  “I don’t much like walking – or doors for that matter.  Never really saw the point myself.  Although, some of my siblings like to put on airs and act all mortal.  Different strokes I suppose.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Resisting the urge to throw the mold culture in his stupid, smiling face, Eliza pulled herself to her feet and retook her seat at the workbench.  “What are you here for anyway?” she demanded.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“I’m just a bit bored,” the Hippie replied, pacing around the laboratory and inspecting the vials lined up against the wall.  He would pick up a container, sniff at its contents or dab a finger inside before placing it back on the shelf.  Eliza briefly considered warning him that some of the ingredients were deadly, but then paused.  Maybe he would kill himself… wouldn’t that be a pleasant surprise?</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The Hippie glanced over at Eliza.  “But you never answered my question.  What’re you up to?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Seeing that the ingredients didn’t seem to be affecting the god, Eliza sighed in disappointment.  “I’m trying to see if I can create… well, a living weapon I guess.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Oh really?” the Hippie asked, his voice sounding more excited.  In a flash, he was standing beside Eliza.  “What are we making?  Fire-breathing ants?  Armor-plated wolves?  Flying, poison-spitting spiders?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza just shook her head, gesturing at the petri dish.  “Not quite.  More like a carnivorous mold?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Is it supposed to be pink?” the Hippie asked in confusion.  “Oh, I get it!  That’s to throw off your enemies or lure them into a false sense of security!”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“It’s not pink…” Eliza began and then trailed off as she looked back at the dish and saw the bright pink mold that now rested on the surface.  “What?  How is that possible?” she murmured.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Her thoughts were racing as she inspected the dish more carefully.  Had she contaminated the sample somehow?  Or maybe the pellet contained a dye?  Except she knew the pellets were little more than a mash of baked grain – she had helped Alma prepare them herself.  So there had to be some other explanation.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Maybe it’s just a fluke,” the Hippie suggested, peering at the mold from a few inches away.  “A rather charming accident, though.  You could accessorize your living weapons to go with your outfit.  Oh, or you could create different product lines and open a little shop!  Eliza’s Rainbow Rot!”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Shut up,” Eliza snapped at the god, and he gave her a wounded expression, clutching at his heart before dropping to the ground as though he had died.  “I’m trying to think,” she explained, ignoring his antics.  As always, the Hippie wasn’t here to help, he was just distracting her, and yet…</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Something the god had said stuck with her.  He had mentioned an accident.  Eliza couldn’t help but recall her biology lectures from earlier that week. She had been a bit distracted by being put on the spot.  What had her teacher been droning on about?</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Microevolution,” she murmured to herself as the memory finally came back to her.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Micro-what?” the Hippie asked, sitting up suddenly.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“In my world, plants and animals evolve naturally over time,” Eliza explained as she prepped another dish.  There was only one way to test her theory.  “Most big evolutionary changes happen over time – sometimes resulting in entirely new species.  Like primates evolving into homo sapiens.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“However, some evolution can happen much more quickly within a single species,” Eliza continued, settling the new dish on the workbench.  “Sometimes changes can even be seen within a few generations.  Certain types of organisms are more susceptible to this – especially things like bacteria that reproduce very rapidly.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“I think…” Eliza said, beginning to channel her mana and watching as a single drop of sapphire mana welled at the tip of her finger.  The droplet splashed against the new mold culture a moment later.  The mold expanded at a rapid rate, devouring another pellet.  Eliza held her breath waiting for… something.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Umm, so were we expecting yellow this time?” the Hippie asked.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza ignored him, staring at the dish.  A moment later, an object began to form in the mold.  It looked remarkably like a leaf, and it tilted and twisted until its surface was pointed at the nearby window.  An excited grin crept across Eliza’s face.  Now this was incredible.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“I think that by accelerating the growth of the mold, I’m triggering some sort of micro-evolution,” Eliza finally said in a distracted voice.  “If this place operates in the same way as my world, the cells must be replicating at an amazing rate – with unusual mutations as the result.  Like the pink color and that thing that looks like a leaf.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Oookay,” the Hippie said slowly.  “So how does this help?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“You’ll see,” Eliza replied quickly, already starting her preparations.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">She set to work gathering dozens of the glass petri dishes and prepping the cultures for the application of her </span><span class="calibre21">Accelerated Growth</span><span class="calibre6">.  She used a few of the dishes as control samples, placing a single pellet in the center of the dish.  With others, she tried something different.  If she was right and the game was essentially replicating some type of microevolution, she could probably achieve different results if she intentionally introduced specific mutagens into the mix – something to encourage a certain evolutionary path.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Fumbling around with a few different options, Eliza added more pellets to one culture.  She added various ingredients to the others – simple and more complex mixtures of the plants and powders lingering around the room.  She was careful to label each culture with the specific set of ingredients she had introduced so that she could keep track.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">As she was walking around the lab, Eliza noticed a batch of small mana crystals lying off to the side.  She had never really used the crystals before, but she had seen Alma utilize them on occasion.  The older alchemist sometimes used them when brewing complicated potions, dissolving the crystals slowly to add mana or water to a mixture or crushing them suddenly to inject water into the brewing apparatus.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“This might be interesting,” she said to herself grabbing a few of the crystals and adding them to a petri dish.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Finally, she surveyed her work.  Dozens of cultures were spread across every available surface in the lab.  It would be a royal pain in the ass to clean everything up, but this should give her a ton of feedback in a short period of time.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">However, as she glanced around the room, Eliza couldn’t help but feel like something was off.  It took her a moment to realize that the Hippie had disappeared.  He must have gotten bored during her experimental fugue and gone off to pester some other poor person.  On the other hand, at least he wasn’t there touching everything and ruining her samples.  With a shrug, she pulled up the in-game system console and created a new worksheet.  She was going to need to plug in each culture with its own reference number and ingredient composition and then record the results.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“This is going to take a while,” Eliza murmured.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">In fact, it took a few hours.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">When Eliza finally came back up for air, the sun had long since set, and the laboratory was illuminated solely by flickering candlelight.  Her cultures spanned the entire lab, their surfaces covered in a panoply of substances – only some of which resembled the original gray mold.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">A few of the spores had merely changed color, picking up on the dyes and natural coloring in the mutagens she had added to the dishes.  Others had undergone more dramatic changes.  Half-formed leaves adorned more than one dish.  One of the cultures had mutated to form spindly, almost animal-like limbs that stretched toward other sources of organic matter.  A few of the cultures had actually managed to move, and she had been forced to terminate those cultures by tossing them into the nearby fire.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">That had been a little nerve-wracking…</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Now Eliza’s attention was focused on one culture in particular.  This mold pulsed with a dull blue glow and she had transferred it from its original small petri dish to a much larger glass plate.  She had added one of the water mana crystals to the culture along with some Calypsis Leaf.  The mold had absorbed the material and the organic matter in the pellet and now throbbed with an eerie light.  However, that wasn’t what was truly interesting.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza’s hand hovered over the plate, a single pellet suspended in her hand.  She took a deep breath and then dropped it.  As soon as the pellet struck the glowing mold, the material seemed to ripple and contorted, blossoming in size as it devoured the organic matter at an incredible rate – growing at a speed she had only witnessed when she was channeling </span><span class="calibre21">Accelerated Growth</span><span class="calibre6">.  In a matter of seconds, it had filled the entire plate.  Then it stopped as it ran out of organic material to feed upon.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">She inspected the mold, and her eyes widened in shock.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre7"> <span class="calibre6"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre56">Carnivorous Mold (Mutant Variant)</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre32"> <span class="calibre57">This mold has mutated under prolonged exposure to water mana, absorbing local mutagens and allowing the fungus to naturally accelerate its own growth.  The growth scale is currently unknown, but preliminary observations suggest that that the rate of cellular reproduction may be relative to available consumable organic matter and the size of the initial spore culture.  Further study is required to reveal additional information.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre7"> <span class="calibre6"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza couldn’t help but stare at the notification.  There was still plenty of work to do to determine the growth rate of the mold and its limitations, but she could still feel excitement bubbling in her chest.  Unlike using some sort of flammable oil, a swiftly growing fungus might address all of her problems.  It would likely be easy to conceal and wouldn’t require her to ignite or start a fire.  Most importantly, it offered plausible deniability, and it would likely grow slowly enough to allow the residents of the farm to evacuate.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“This might just work,” Eliza murmured, shadows flickering across her face and painting her excited grin in a manic, almost macabre light.  She would need to run some additional experiments, but her tentative plan was beginning to look like it might not fail horribly.  What could go wrong?</span> </p>
