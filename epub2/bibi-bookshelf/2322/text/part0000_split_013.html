   <p class="calibre7"> <span class="calibre6"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza hefted her pack and eyed the tree line next to Alma’s compound skeptically.  With a sigh, she pulled up her inventory menu and checked her crafting supplies.  She had been putting off the journey for the last few hours, telling herself that she needed to prepare more potions and spend just a few more minutes getting ready.  However, she knew the truth.  She was just procrastinating.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Going somewhere?” Alma asked, causing Eliza to jump slightly.  She turned to find the elderly woman exiting the garden, a basket filled with rather ordinary-looking vegetables in her hand.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“I… I was going to go into the woods,” Eliza said, struggling to come up with an explanation for her odd quest that didn’t involve mentioning the Hippie or his pet sheep.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Well, that’s good.  We could use some more Ferntail if you find any,” Alma replied with a nod of her head.  “Just be careful.  There are many wild animals in the woods – some of which aren’t particularly friendly.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“I will,” Eliza murmured as she watched the older alchemist shuffle up to her cottage.  For a brief moment, she considered just going inside with Alma and helping her cook lunch.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre21">No! You don’t get to cop out that easily</span><span class="calibre6">, she reprimanded herself.  </span><span class="calibre21">You agreed to this – you wanted this.  Now follow through!</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">With that thought, Eliza took a tentative step toward the woods.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Then another.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Before she knew it, she had walked much deeper into the forest than she ever had before.  The trees towered around her, their branches crisscrossing in the air and creating a thick latticework of leaves that blocked out the sun and cast the forest in a gloomy haze.  It almost seemed ominous the way the light had begun to recede, but Eliza shook off those thoughts.  It didn’t help to wring her hands at this point.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">She had been following a small hunting trail away from Alma’s compound, the thin path winding its way between the trees and undergrowth.  Eliza struggled to make it through some parts of the path, having to climb over fallen trunks and wedge between several bushes.  A real dagger or machete would probably have been useful.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Despite her endless preparations, Eliza hadn’t thought that far ahead.  In fact, as she thought about her weapons, she realized she was relatively defenseless.  She had the little knife she used around the garden, and, at some point, she had picked up a walking stick – a habit from another world.  However, she didn’t expect that the roughhewn branch would provide much help if she was attacked by something like the troll.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">What she did have was her magic.  </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Her </span><span class="calibre21">Ice Bolt</span><span class="calibre6"> might come in handy, but it took a few seconds to cast.  She hadn’t tried </span><span class="calibre21">Cold Grasp </span><span class="calibre6">yet, but the Hippie had explained that it was some sort of area of effect ability.  There hadn’t been much need for the spell in Alma’s garden.  Finally, she had her mist – which she now knew she could imbue with poison – assuming her hypothetical enemy let her call a “time out” so that she could suspend the spell and pull out a poison vial.  The problem was that all of her spells were time-consuming.  If anything were to actually attack her, she’d probably have little opportunity to react.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre21">Great.  I’m going to die.  Again</span><span class="calibre6">, she thought bleakly.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">With that happy thought, Eliza turned a corner on the trail and almost ran smack into a group of players.  As soon as they caught sight of her, the group had multiple weapons leveled at Eliza, flames curling around the head of a staff and more than one projectile pointed at her head.  The player in the lead was a burly warrior wielding a wicked-looking one-handed axe.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza pulled up short, her mouth forming a small “O.”  “I… I’m sorry,” she stuttered, raising her empty hands.  “I’m just collecting herbs.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The lead player dropped his axe, waving a hand at his teammates.  “Relax, it’s just one girl.  She doesn’t look like a PK’er.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“PK’er?” Eliza echoed, her heart still beating rapidly.  “What do you mean?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The player cocked his head at her quizzically, causing his mail armor to clink gently.  “How long have you been playing?  Nevermind.  It means ‘player killer.’  There are quite a few people out in these woods hunting and leveling.  Most don’t mind killing another player and taking their equipment.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza inadvertently took a step back, eyeing the players with a newfound suspicion.  She hadn’t considered the possibility of players killing one another for loot – although it seemed obvious in retrospect.  Perhaps she had been worried about the wildlife when she should have been focused on avoiding other people.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Don’t worry,” the mage said, the woman noticing Eliza’s expression.  The player looked at Eliza kindly, and the flames around her staff began to dissipate.  “We’re not going to hurt you.  We were just out here leveling.  I guess we’re on edge.  This game can be a little… intense.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The warrior nodded in agreement.  “My only point was that you should be careful out here by yourself.”  The man hesitated for a moment, looking back at his teammates and receiving a few not-so-subtle nods.  “Actually, do you want to group up with us?  An alchemist might be useful if you’re carrying a bunch of healing potions.  Plus, you could gain some experience.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza almost said yes, but then stopped herself.  She couldn’t really explain why she was out here.  What if they ran into the stag?  Would they just let her keep the pelt?  It was difficult to imagine that the players would simply go along with her explanation that a homeless god had told her to kill some sort of magical deer.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“I… I appreciate it, but I’m almost finished,” Eliza explained timidly.  “I just need to gather a few ingredients, and then I’m heading back to town.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“No worries, we were actually thinking of heading back to town soon anyway,” the warrior said with a nod of his head, before motioning to the group around him to continue forward.  The rest of the players trudged past her, heading back the way she had come.  “Stay safe,” the warrior called over his shoulder before they disappeared around the bend in the hunting trail.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza’s eyes lingered on the trail for a few more seconds as she considered what the players had told her.  She had just gone through the process of cataloging her weapons – or lack thereof.  Other people might be useful.  Apart from her victory against the troll, she wasn’t exactly combat worthy, and even that conflict had been a little lopsided.  She wasn’t certain that ambushing a sleeping monster really counted as a “battle.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Yet there was little she could do about that now.  As usual, the Hippie had placed her in another precarious position.  Not that she was surprised.  He seemed to enjoy tormenting her.  Grumbling under her breath about lazy idiot gods, Eliza decided to keep pushing forward.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Perhaps it was for the best that she had to handle this quest alone.  Even in the real world, she didn’t exactly attract friends.  If anything, the students in her prep courses just viewed her as competition – making nasty little comments and snubbing her from joining their groups.  Why should it be any different in-game?  People were still people, after all.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Lost in her gloomy thoughts, Eliza didn’t notice the bear until she had almost walked into it.  The creature’s rumbling growl was the first indication that she might be in trouble.  She glanced up quickly to find herself face-to-face with what appeared to be a real-world grizzly bear.  The massive creature stared at her with red eyes and a snarl reverberated its lungs.  A quick </span><span class="calibre21">Inspection</span><span class="calibre6"> revealed the following:</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre7"> <span class="calibre6"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre32"> <span class="calibre34">Grizzly Bear – Level 22 </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre32"> <span class="calibre34">Health – 500</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre32"> <span class="calibre34">Mana – Unknown</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre32"> <span class="calibre34">Equipment – None</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre32"> <span class="calibre34">Resistances – Unknown</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre32"> <span class="calibre34">Weakness – Unknown</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre7"> <span class="calibre6"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Without thinking, Eliza began to back away slowly, taking a few tentative steps.  This was apparently the wrong move, and the bear reared up on its hind legs, towering almost eight feet into the air before slamming its clawed paws back onto the trail – causing the ground to tremble slightly.  The creature was only standing a few yards away, glaring at her menacingly.  How could she have missed it?  She should have been paying attention!</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Oh shit,” Eliza murmured, her mind wheeling.  She tried to recall the little she knew about confronting bears in the real world – something about yelling at them or posturing…  That didn’t seem like it would be effective here.  Although, fighting the hulking beast also seemed like it would just result in her untimely death.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Which left one option.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">She glanced at the area around her, trying desperately to find somewhere she could run.  A tree stood to her side, a single low-hanging branch relatively accessible despite her short stature.  A tentative, desperate plan began to form in her mind.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">As the bear took a lumbering step forward, Eliza bolted.  She darted for the tree beside her, jumping and grabbing at the branch.  In the real world, the tree limb would likely have been out of reach, but, with her slightly enhanced statistics, she managed to just barely make the jump and her fingers curled around the rough bark.  She desperately pulled herself up as she heard the thunder of the bear’s paws striking the ground behind her and the drumbeat of her own heart.  At the last second, she managed to scramble onto the branch just as the bear’s paw crashed into the base of the tree.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza chanced a glance down and immediately wished she hadn’t.  She could see that the single swipe of the bear’s claws had torn deep grooves in the base of the tree trunk, and it was already rising on its hind legs and clutching at the base of the tree as it began to climb – seemingly undeterred that its prey had fled into the trees.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Moving quickly, Eliza climbed further up tree’s wide limbs, the occasional stray branch scraping the skin of her hands and arms as she hauled herself up.  Within only a few seconds, she sat nearly twenty feet above the bear, clutching at the trunk of the tree to maintain her precarious balance.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">To her dismay, the grizzly had made good progress as well, its claws digging into the bark and hauling up its bulk.  She wouldn’t have long before it reached her perch in the tree.  Moving quickly, Eliza’s hands began twining through the gestures of her </span><span class="calibre21">Ice Bolt</span><span class="calibre6"> spell, a shard of ice forming in the air before her.  It was difficult to maintain her balance since she had to use both hands to cast the spell – the whole process made worse by the fact that tree limb beneath her trembled and shook as the bear made its ascent.  She tried her best to aim the spell, the bolt dancing erratically as she attempted to focus.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">As Eliza completed the spell, the shard raced forward… and shattered harmlessly against the ground near the bear.  Her aim had been off, and the creature had already inched its way closer, its massive claws scraping against the tree trunk and its mouth opening in another growl – revealing a massive pair of fangs.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Her thoughts raced, and her heart thumped in her chest as she watched the beast.  It was all she could do to keep her balance on the tree limb, much less aim her spells.  In her desperation, Eliza tried </span><span class="calibre21">Cold Grasp</span><span class="calibre6"> instead.  Her hands trembled as they wound through the gestures of the new spell and a ring of blue energy began to form along the trunk of the tree beside the grizzly.  A moment later, the spell completed, and spikes of ice abruptly jutted from the ring of energy.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The icy spears thrust into the bear’s torso, blood bubbling around the wounds, and the creature let out a massive roar of pain.  The beast gave a mighty heave, the lances of ice breaking in half with a crunch – leaving several spears embedded in its side.  The entire tree trembled as the bear tried to avoid falling, its claws curling around a nearby branch and scraping at the bark frantically.  It managed to regain its balance and only seemed more enraged by Eliza’s spells as it continued to climb.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza spared a glance at her mana pool and saw she could cast the spell a couple more times, and so, acting quickly, she began casting again and again.  Glowing azure rings continued to appear along the trunk, followed shortly by lances of ice that speared outward and into the bear’s flesh.  However, even when Eliza managed to land a direct blow, the creature shrugged off the attacks, seemingly undeterred despite the blood that now stained its matted fur.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">In her haste, she missed the next few spells, the frozen spears lancing harmlessly into the air.  Yet the ice inadvertently created a veritable wall between her and the bear – the lances forming a makeshift barrier, and thick ice coating the surrounding bark.  This slowed the bear’s progress since its claws had trouble finding purchase on the slick surface.  The beast tentatively smacked against the icy barrier to no avail, letting out a massive bellow of frustrated rage as it realized that it wouldn’t be able to make it to its prey.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza used the momentary lull to pull a mana potion from her pack and quickly chug its contents, noting that the potion began to restore her waning mana supplies.  At the same time, the bear seemed to give up its chase, and the entire tree shook as the beast let go and landed heavily on the ground below.  It then began pacing around the base of the tree, sniffing at the trunk.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">She almost breathed a sigh of relief, but immediately froze as the creature met her gaze – its eyes filled with rage.  It had no intentions of giving up.  With an uncanny intelligence, the bear turned to the trunk, extending its claws and swiping experimentally at the base of the tree.  The blow caused fragments of bark to cascade out from the impact site, and the tree lurched to the side.  The beast snorted as it heard Eliza’s yelp of surprise and immediately followed up with another attack, its claws scraping deep furrows in the wood.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Oh shit,” Eliza murmured, quickly realizing that the bear was planning to bring down the entire tree – and her with it.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">She frantically began casting </span><span class="calibre21">Ice Bolt</span><span class="calibre6">, a shard of ice forming in the air before launching forward at a frightening pace.  Her aim was better this time, and the lance struck the bear in the side of the neck, bright-red blood welling around the wound and staining the forest floor.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">However, the beast ignored the blow and kept going, its claws swiping at the tree again in a frenzy as Eliza kept casting her spells – trying her best to aim as the tree swayed beneath her.  The race was on now, and it was all she could do to keep casting </span><span class="calibre21">Ice Bolt</span><span class="calibre6"> in the vain hope of slaying the bear before it brought down the entire tree.  Bolt after bolt of ice crashed into the beast’s form, penetrating its torso and neck.  Meanwhile, she could feel the entire tree tremble as the bear tore into the trunk.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">As the tree gave a final shudder and threatened to collapse, Eliza summoned one last icy spear, her heart beating hard in her chest and despair curling in her stomach.  The fragment danced and spun erratically in the air as it pieced itself together.  This time, she used every last ounce of concentration to aim the shard.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Time seemed to slow as the bolt raced forward, Eliza’s breath caught in her throat as her eyes traced its trail.  The bear reared up, readying itself for a final swipe.  Just as it was about to strike, the shard penetrated its eye, a massive spurt of blood erupting from the wound.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The bear abruptly stopped its attack, roaring in pain as it clawed at its own eye.  Its claws had shattered the end of the projectile, but it was unable to pull out the fragments of ice that had already been embedded in its eye socket.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza capitalized on her opportunity, summoning yet another </span><span class="calibre21">Cold Grasp</span><span class="calibre6">.  The blue circle appeared under the bear, centered on its neck as it writhed on the ground and pawed frantically at its face.  As she finished casting the spell, lances of ice speared upward, piercing the creature’s neck and erupting from the other side in a spray of hot blood.  The bear twitched and struggled against the spears pinning it to the ground, its growls turning into gurgling coughs.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">A moment later, the creature finally lay limp and unmoving.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre7"> <span class="calibre6"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre46">The Grizzly Bear has died.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre7"> <span class="calibre6"> </span> </p>

   <p class="calibre7"> <span class="calibre6"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza still sat perched in the tree, her breath coming in ragged gasps as she stared down at the bear’s corpse.  Shards of ice littered the tree trunk and the ground around the tree, the crystalline surface of the spears stained crimson with the beast’s lifeblood.  The ground around the tree had been trampled flat, and fragments of bark and wood lay across the area.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">As Eliza took in the scene of destruction, she couldn’t quite believe that she was still alive.  On top of that, she had actually taken out another creature in-game!  However, that thought immediately gave her pause, the evidence of the hard-won battle still lingering around her.  She had only barely made it through the fight and only by immediately fleeing up a tree.  At this thought, the sudden flush of victory vanished – replaced with a sense of despair that curled and coiled in her stomach like a living thing.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">A single question kept bouncing around her head.  If it was this difficult to take out a normal beast her own level, what hope did she have of slaying the Silver Stag?</span> </p>
