   <p class="calibre7"> <span class="calibre6"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">When Eliza finally made it home from school, she immediately ran up to her room and donned her headset.  Moments later, she was standing in Alma’s garden, sunlight streaming through the leaves of the multi-colored plants around her and droplets of dew hovering on their leaves.  In contrast to the austere environment of her school and the harsh fluorescent lighting, the garden was refreshing – and a welcome relief.  She felt more at peace here – more than anywhere else in her life.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">However, her momentary respite was interrupted as a series of notifications appeared in front of her in an endless stream.  Eliza’s eyes widened as she surveyed the notices, her mind wheeling in confusion.</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre7"> <span class="calibre6"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“How is this possible?” she murmured to herself.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza had no idea what to make of this.  It had to be a mistake.  How could she have leveled twelve times while logged out?  Yet, as her eyes skimmed the notifications, she also noticed how much her </span><span class="calibre21">Cold Grasp</span><span class="calibre6"> spell had improved.  Had her traps killed a bunch of creatures in the forest?  That seemed like a possible explanation, although she was surprised that she had gotten credit for the kills while logged out at Alma’s compound.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Maybe the distance didn’t matter if they were her traps?</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">She shook her head.  It did her no good to stand there in the garden guessing.  She needed to follow through with her plan.  She should go visit Evan and then check on her traps.  That was the only way she was going to figure out what had happened.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza started making her way toward Falcon’s Hook, following the small trail leading away from Alma’s cottage until it met up with the main road.  As she neared town, the number of players on the road increased dramatically – with the usual crowd making the long trek back to town after hunting in the nearby forests.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza usually kept her head down to avoid drawing attention, not making eye contact or sparing much attention to the other people around her.  However, she couldn’t help but notice that the players looked more disheveled than usual.  Their armor was torn and bloodied, and their faces were haggard.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Come on, Amanda,” a player said from behind Eliza.  “You need to hurry up so that we can regroup with Scott and Justin when they respawn and head back to the forest.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“What’s the point?” the girl muttered dejectedly.  “You saw that poor </span><span class="calibre21">excuse</span><span class="calibre6"> for a battle.  We had those four wolves cornered and then half our team just dies?  What were those spikes that came out of the ground?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza could feel a hollow weight settle in her stomach as she listened to their conversation and she risked a furtive glance over her shoulder.  Amanda was clearly a mage, her green robes torn and stained with blood.  Her shoulders were drooped dejectedly as she trudged forward.  The man beside her didn’t look any better – his leather armor was ripped, and the sheath at his waist was empty.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“I don’t know,” he said.  “I just don’t know.  I thought I saw some sort of debuff before they died.  My combat log showed they were taking damage even after those spikes appeared, but it just says </span><span class="calibre21">unidentified damage</span><span class="calibre6"> – whatever that means.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“This game was hard enough before our groupmates randomly died for no reason.  Is this a bug or something?” the girl groused.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">A few other players nearby were paying close attention to this conversation.  A gruff older man, his face covered in a thick silver stubble, spoke up, “Wait, you guys lost some teammates to some sort of ice spikes?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Yeah,” Amanda replied.  “Took out two team members in about 10 seconds.  We barely managed to run away from the wolves…”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“The same thing happened to us,” the man said with a frown and gestured at his teammates.  “We’re actually going back to town for the respawns too.  I don’t think it’s a bug, though…” he murmured, trailing off in thought.  “I’ve played for a while now, and I haven’t noticed a single glitch or bug.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Me either,” another player chimed in.  The conversation had now drawn the attention of most of the surrounding players and NPCs.  “But we encountered the ice spikes too.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza’s heart was beating rapidly in her chest, and she couldn’t help but shrink in on herself, studiously avoiding looking at any of the players around her and speeding up her pace slightly.  She was starting to suspect that her newfound levels might have had a different source than just wild animals.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“So, what does this mean?” Amanda asked, her eyes widening as the conversation continued.  “If it’s not a bug, then what?  There weren’t random ice spikes a few days ago.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Her teammate ran a frustrated hand through his hair.  “Well, there’s one obvious answer.  If it isn’t a bug – and I’m not saying that isn’t a possibility – then it could be another player or NPC.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“You know, the spikes did sort of resemble the </span><span class="calibre21">Cold Grasp</span><span class="calibre6"> spell that water mages have,” another player chimed in.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Sure, but that spell doesn’t usually apply a damage over time effect,” the older man said, his voice sounding distracted.  “Our teammates didn’t die to the spikes, they died from the DOT.  They were taking damage long after we got them free, we just didn’t catch it in time.  </span><span class="calibre21">Cold Grasp</span><span class="calibre6"> also needs to be cast.  We didn’t find anyone in the nearby woods.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Maybe one of the PK guilds figured out a clever way to hunt low-level players?” Amanda asked, bitterness tinging her voice.  “I wouldn’t put it past some of them.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Except they didn’t take any loot,” her teammate offered in rebuttal.  “What’s the point of slaying a bunch of players if you don’t collect their stuff?  You’d be better off just hunting other creatures in that case – especially if they were skilled enough to come up with this type of spell.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“You’re right.  I don’t get it,” the older man said, shaking his head in confusion.  His reaction was mirrored by the group of players near Eliza.  “But one thing is for sure, we need to start being careful in the forest.  Regardless of whoever or </span><span class="calibre21">whatever</span><span class="calibre6"> is responsible, it’s becoming really dangerous to try to level near town.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza hastened her steps further at that point, putting some distance between herself and the players.  Her mind was wheeling as she tried to process their conversation.  One thing was certain, it looked like she was responsible for killing quite a few players – even if it had been an accident.  That hadn’t been her goal at all, and she hadn’t even thought about the other players when she had set the traps the day before.  She had just wanted to test them on the forest creatures!</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">What would happen if the other players somehow discovered that she was responsible for the traps?  The conversation she had just overheard had already hit a little too close to home.  They had identified her </span><span class="calibre21">Cold Grasp</span><span class="calibre6"> spell at least – which was to be expected.  The spell was a pretty common choice for low-level water mages.  Although, the fact that they hadn’t been able to identify her poison was a positive.  They also hadn’t mentioned her name, so their combat log must not have populated that information.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">That made her hesitate.  She pulled up her own combat log and saw that the damage and deaths had been registered, but the creatures and players afflicted by her spells and poisons weren’t identified.  Maybe she needed to be within range to gain this information – the game system limiting her info to things that her character knew or that she had observed herself.  If that were the case, it would be really difficult for the players to link the deaths to her.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The more Eliza thought through the problem, the more she began to relax.  A worm of worry still wriggled in her stomach, but it didn’t seem like the players would be able to start a witch hunt targeting her specifically.  They might be on the lookout for water mages, though.  At that thought, Eliza glanced down at herself, noting her faded tunic and trousers.  She had barely upgraded from the beginner equipment, and the cloth was stained by the various ingredients she used in her potions.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre21">I don’t even really look like a mage</span><span class="calibre6">, she thought to herself.  At least, I’m not wearing the typical robes or using a staff.  If she could figure out some way to hide her class and abilities further, that would be to her advantage.  Plus, she had a cover for being in the forest since she needed ingredients for her potions and she had a good reputation in town.  She might be able to avoid detection for a long time.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre21">What am I saying?</span><span class="calibre6"> Eliza demanded of herself, stopping that line of thought short.  </span><span class="calibre21">Am I really planning to keep laying traps?</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">She couldn’t help but recall how helpless she had felt at the hands of the PK’ers or the looks of frustrated anger on the other players’ faces.  She shook her head.  She wouldn’t really wish that on anyone.  Yet, at the same time, the experience and skill increases she had gained were incredible.  A not-insignificant part of her wanted to keep going.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre21">Maybe I can just wait and talk to Evan.  If I can retrieve my new weapons and take out the stag, then I can go back to helping Alma, and I won’t need to worry about any of this</span><span class="calibre6">, she decided, her hands clenching into fists as the city’s gates loomed in front of her.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">With a tentative plan in place, Eliza focused on making her way through the town, taking a winding path through its chaotic streets until she found herself in front of the door to Evan’s shop – the familiar worn shingle fluttering in the stiff ocean breeze that blew through the city’s streets.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza hesitantly stepped inside the gloomy little shop, immediately overwhelmed once more by the incessant, rhythmic tick of Evan’s many clocks.  The grizzled engineer was standing in his work area near the back of the shop, and he didn’t bother to glance up as she approached.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“I’ll be with you in a moment,” Evan barked in a distracted voice while hunched over a strange-looking contraption on his workbench.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“N-no problem,” Eliza replied shyly.  “I’m just here to pick up my comission.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">That immediately got the engineer’s attention, and he glanced up, his eyes widening.  “Ahh, Eliza!  Nevermind, I’ve been waiting for you to show up for more than a day now.  Let me go get your new beauties.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Evan rushed into the back room before Eliza could say anything in response, her mouth hanging open in surprise.  The engineer returned only a moment later, carrying what appeared to be a cloth bundle.  As Eliza looked on, he set the bundle on a table and unrolled it, revealing a row of wands attached to the interior.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“So, instead of a staff, I decided to go with something a little different,” Evan said with a grand gesture, his mouth twisting into a broad smile.  He picked up a single wand and handed it to her.  It had a plain metallic base that gave off a faint sheen in the dull light of the shop, and a single colored band had been attached halfway up the hilt.  The top of the wand was adorned with a milky white crystal.  In many ways, it looked like an ordinary wand.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">A quick inspection revealed the following:</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre7"> <span class="calibre6"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre32"> <span class="calibre47">Deathwind Wand V1.0</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre32"> <span class="calibre48">At a first glance, this wand appears rather normal.  However, upon closer inspection, you notice that a clever mechanism has been installed in the interior of the shaft and the head of the wand can be removed.  Additional testing and improvements may increase the efficiency and casting speed of the wand.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre32"> <span class="calibre47">Quality:  </span><span class="calibre48">C</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre32"> <span class="calibre47">Damage:</span><span class="calibre48">  NA </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre47">Durability:</span><span class="calibre48">  20/20</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre32"> <span class="calibre48">+5 Intelligence</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre32"> <span class="calibre48">+5 Willpower</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre32"> <span class="calibre48">+5% Casting Speed</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre7"> <span class="calibre6"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“How does it work?” Eliza asked, curiosity lacing her voice.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Here, let me show you,” Evan said, picking up another wand – this one had a green band.  “The base of the wand is actually hollow.  You can pop the top by pressing this catch,” he explained, thumbing a nearly invisible latch just underneath the crystal.  The top of the wand promptly flipped open, revealing a small compartment.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“You can place a vial in this compartment.  I have taken the liberty of creating a special cartridge just for these wands,” Evan explained, pulling out a wooden container filled with small jars.  He pulled one out and handed it to Eliza.  “I designed the cartridge to hook into a crystal matrix built into the bottom of the wand and the top portion of the vial is covered with a semi-porous material.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Okay…,” Eliza said, flabbergasted by the man’s rapid-fire explanation.  “So what happens if I press this button on the side,” she asked, pointing to a small crystal button near the base of the rod.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Evan’ smile widened.  “If a cartridge is loaded, that will ignite the air crystals along the bottom, causing a gust of air to push the vial’s contents up and through the crystal.  He flipped the top back down and showed Eliza the top of the wand.  “I drilled small holes in the focusing crystal so that the substance would shoot out of the top.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza’s eyes widened in surprise.  “If I’m understanding you correctly, I would basically shove the wand into the orb of water and then push this button on the side, and it would eject the contents into the sphere?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Exactly,” the engineer said, nodding excitedly.  “You can then put different cartridges in different wands.  You will need to pre-load them of course, but I have color coded the wands so that you can keep track of which poisons are associated with each weapon.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“This… this is amazing,” Eliza murmured as she inspected the wands.  She hadn’t even considered color-coding her wands or how she would keep each one straight.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“You haven’t even tried them yet!” Evan exclaimed.  “And I took the liberty of setting up a little demonstration.”  With that statement, the engineer circled around his worktable and quickly stepped toward the front door, throwing the lock into place.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Evan then headed back to Eliza and yanked away a tarp covering what she had initially assumed was a crate in the corner of his shop.  Inside, Eliza could see a rabbit, its ears perking up and flicking back and forth as it surveyed the shop.  “Here is your specimen and you can load a vial with one of your own poisons.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza was also curious to see the wands in operation, and she pulled a green vial from her bag, carefully pouring its contents into one of the new cartridges that Evan had designed.  She then slotted the cartridge into a wand and snapped the crystal lid closed.  With her preparations complete, Eliza squared off facing the cage – Evan hovering near her shoulder and bouncing slightly on his toes in his excitement.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Here goes nothing,” Eliza murmured.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Her free hand began to wind through the gesture of </span><span class="calibre21">Obscuring Mist</span><span class="calibre6">.  The wand’s crystal flared to life, sapphire energy swirling across its surface before forming a globe of water in front of Eliza.  Instead of suspending the spell as she typically did, Eliza simply plunged the wand into the globe and depressed the button that Evan had indicated while continuing the spell.  She felt the wand vibrate slightly and her poison was ejected from the end of the wand and into the sphere – quickly turning it an ominous emerald.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">As the spell completed, the orb exploded in a cloud of dense green fog, and Eliza was already mentally ordering the mist to cover the rabbit’s cage.  A moment later, the animal was obscured from sight, and she heard a faint gurgling sound.  As the spell began to dissipate, the rabbit came back into view, its corpse lying unmoving on its side.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Ahh, now </span><span class="calibre21">that’s</span><span class="calibre6"> fascinating,” Evan murmured from beside Eliza.  He snatched at the wand and opened it to inspect the cartridge, noting that some of the poison hadn’t been ejected properly.  “I can still improve on the internal mechanism…” he muttered to himself and turned to his worktable to start scratching out some rough notes.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“It works fine for now,” Eliza said before he completely forgot she was there.  “Actually, this is kind of amazing.  Thank you so much, Evan.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“No problem.  The next version will be better, I promise,” he said, waving a distracted hand at her.  “You can take this batch in the meantime.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Uh, do I owe you for the next group,” Eliza asked cautiously, suddenly realizing that she didn’t have any more loot to offer in payment.  She wasn’t looking forward to another trip to the troll’s former den.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Evan turned to face her, his eyes meeting hers.  “No, no.  You paid more than enough to cover a few rounds of prototypes and cartridges.  Plus, this project is fascinating.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Then the man hesitated, his mechanical arm whirring slightly as he fiddled with it with his free hand.  “Speaking of which, Alma stopped by the other day and explained your goal – to kill the Silver Stag.  That’s rather ambitious.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza’s eyes dropped to the floor self-consciously.  “I’m going to try at least,” she said quietly.  “Even if I’ll probably fail.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Well, I have a vested interest in your success now, so I wanted to mention that the competition has become quite fierce.  The bounty has also been increased to 500 gold.  It seems Lord Baen is getting a little more frantic.  He must have a potential buyer for the pelt on the line.”  Evan looked at her with a sober expression.  “You should be careful out there.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza managed to meet his gaze, seeing that he was dead serious.  “I mean it,” Evan continued.  “Don’t hesitate to use your new toys.  Even if you manage to slay the beast, the other travelers may simply take the pelt from you.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“I-I will,” Eliza stuttered slightly.  She wasn’t about to correct him about why she was pursuing this quest.  She wasn’t exactly in it for the money.  Regardless of the reason, it wouldn’t matter much to him.  Trying to tell someone else about the Hippie and all of his nonsense seemed like more of a headache than it was worth anyway.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">With that, Eliza gathered up her new equipment, strapping the bundle of wands to her back and deciding to hold the tray of new cartridges so that they didn’t get broken.  It was a little unwieldy to carry everything at once, but she assumed she could travel in a lighter fashion once she had everything stored away at Alma’s compound.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza soon found herself standing outside of Evan’ shop, the tray of cartridges grasped tightly in front of her.  She could already see travelers passing the mouth of the alley as they wound their way through the nearby market.  She couldn’t help but reflect on what Evan had told her – and the conversation she had overheard on her way into town.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">She hadn’t meant to kill the players with her traps, but perhaps Evan was right.  If she was to have any hope of slaying the Silver Stag and keeping its pelt, she might need to thin the herd – so to speak.  Besides, if she were being completely honest with herself, it had been sort of fun to hear the other players talking about her, albeit in a slightly terrifying way.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The memory of her encounter with Rebecca and Josh earlier that day was also still fresh in her mind.  Instead of removing her traps, what if she doubled down?  A small, excited grin curled her lips as she considered ways she could ramp up her trap production and placement.  She could only imagine her classmates’ reactions if they knew what she was planning next.</span> </p>
