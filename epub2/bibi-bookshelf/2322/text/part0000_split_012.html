<h1 class="calibre16" id="calibre_pb_41"> <a class="calibre17" id="_Toc519440618"><span class="calibre11">Chapter 9</span><span class="calibre18"> -</span><span class="calibre11"> Unperturbed</span></a> </h1> 
   <p class="calibre7"> <span class="calibre6"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza was kneeling in Alma’s garden, plucking at the weeds that sprouted from the bed in front of her.  As she pulled another obnoxious plant, she jerked her hand back abruptly, barely dodging the thorny vine of a Lashtail.  She glared at the offending brown bush – that was the fourth time in the last half hour that it had tried to attack her.  It almost felt like the plant had a personal vendetta against her.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">She wiped a hand across her brow, small droplets of sweat beading on her skin as her eyes took in the garden.  Rays of golden sunlight rested gently across the petals and stalks of the many plants that filled the small enclosure.  A gentle breeze rustled through the leaves and felt cool to the touch.  Not for the first time, Eliza marveled at the realism of this world – relishing the sensation.  If only she could stay here.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">That thought gave her pause.  Eliza didn’t have much longer to continue playing this game.  Yesterday evening, her mother had started harping about one of her co-worker’s kids.  Apparently, she had already been accepted into an ivy-league university – at sixteen no less.  Her mother apparently viewed this as some sort of competition and had not-so-subtly urged Eliza to return to her studies.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Why the troubled expression?” a voice spoke up from behind a nearby hedge.  Eliza couldn’t help but wince as she recognized the speaker – her fears confirmed a moment later as the Hippie’s inquisitive face popped up over the line of leaves.  Yet she supposed she should be thankful.  The idiot god had left her alone for a grand total of a day this time.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“You wouldn’t understand,” Eliza grumbled, returning to her work and pulling at the weeds that had grown up around the Willowbark in front of her.  Each leaf of this plant was roughly ridged – imitating the bark of a tree.  She knew that, when the leaves were ground up, they could be used to create a Fortification Potion, which increased a player’s natural damage resistance.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“You might be surprised!” the Hippie exclaimed, deftly hopping over the hedge and taking a seat on the ground beside her – spreading out and lounging among her plants.  “Fluffy says that I’m a fantastic listener.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">As though he had summoned the sheep, Fluffy trotted around the hedge and up to Eliza, demanding his usual attention before finding a nice sunny spot to take a nap.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Although,” the Hippie continued, tapping his lips, “I suppose he might have been asleep for several of our conversations.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“That isn’t exactly surprising,” Eliza murmured, trying her best not to respond to the god’s teasing.  She was beginning to think he was deliberately trying to get a rise out of her.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">A finger suddenly touched Eliza’s chin and gently encouraged her to look at the Hippie.  She found his face hovering much too close for comfort, the amusement gone from his eyes and replaced with concern.  “Nope.  Something is definitely wrong.  You look positively glum.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">He retreated slightly rubbing at his chin thoughtfully.  Then, before Eliza could respond, he snapped his fingers.  “I’ve got it!  You just need something to distract you!  Perhaps another glorious quest.  Let’s see.  I’ll need to get creative with this one.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The god bounced to his feet and began pacing next to Eliza as he mumbled to himself.  She couldn’t help but note that the Lashtail seemed to lean away from the Hippie as he crossed back and forth in front of the plant.  For once, she could sympathize with the irritating bush.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“I really don’t think that’s necessary…” Eliza tried to say.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Nonsense!” the Hippie interrupted.  “I just came up with a splendid idea.  You’re going to love this one.  Fluffy’s coat now has a fantastic sheen – see, it positively glows,” the god said, gesturing at the sleeping sheep.  From Eliza’s perspective, it looked about the same.  She wasn’t really sure how you could improve on black wool.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The Hippie frowned as he noted Eliza’s less than glowing reaction.  “</span><span class="calibre21">Anyway</span><span class="calibre6">… I’ve been telling Fluffy that we need to accessorize.  You know, add something to really make his eyes pop?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“He looks fine to me,” Eliza replied cautiously.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The young man leaned forward, cupping his mouth with his hand and whispering conspiratorially, “Just between you and me, he has been looking a little frumpy, and he has been acting self-conscious lately.  I’m thinking a makeover would do the trick to rouse him from this slump.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza noticed Fluffy’s ears flick slightly and he opened one irritated eye behind the Hippie’s back, glaring at the god.  Eliza tried her best to stifle a laugh as the Hippie stared at her expectantly.  She opened her mouth to give him her usual response – that she was too busy, and she had no interest in his inane quests.  But then she hesitated, remembering the game footage she had witnessed last night and her secret yearning to do something as meaningful as Jason.  She also couldn’t help but recall her mother’s incessant nagging.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“You know what?  Sure, I’ll help out,” Eliza replied finally, meeting the Hippie’s gaze firmly.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Oh, come on!  It really won’t be so bad,” the Hippie began and then stopped short, a confused look on his face.  “Wait.  Did you just accept?”  He glanced at Fluffy.  “Am I going mad?  Or was I already mad to begin with…”  the god trailed off, clearly flustered by Eliza’s response.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">She would normally have savored the moment a bit more, but Eliza was genuinely curious to find out what the Hippie had planned for her next.  The encounter with the troll hadn’t exactly turned out the way she had been expecting.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“I’ll help,” Eliza repeated before the god began inspecting his own sanity too closely.  That was a rabbit hole that she would rather avoid traveling down.  “What exactly do you have in mind?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The Hippie’s head whipped back toward her, his mouth splitting into a huge grin.  “Oh, you’re going to love this one.  I think that Fluffy needs a new collar!”  He held up a finger.  “But not just any collar.  We can only use the finest materials for a sheep of his majesty and royal demeanor.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Taking a deep breath, the god leaned in close and continued in a theatrical whisper, “In the deepest parts of the nearby forest, there is a beast that is rumored to wander among the trees.  Its coat is said to be made of starlight, and its grace and speed are unparalleled among this world’s creatures.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The Hippie raised a finger.  “But take care!  Many hunters have sought this prize, only to come up shorthanded.  This beast is as elusive as it is beautiful.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza raised an eyebrow as she listened to the god’s description of the creature.  “So… um, what exactly is it?  Is it going to be some sort of dragon?  Or maybe a basilisk that will turn me to stone?  There has to be a catch.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“You wound me,” the Hippie said, straightening and placing a hand on his chest.  “Are you implying that I would somehow send you into peril without sufficient information?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza just stared at the Hippie with a deadpan expression.  That was exactly what she was trying to say.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">His face split into another grin, and the god continued, “Okay, fine.  Perhaps that’s fair after the encounter with the troll.”  He sighed deeply.  “It’s a deer okay?  I want you to go hunt a deer.  Is that so bad?  I think the local townspeople have begun calling it the Silver Stag.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Is it an acid-spitting deer with razor-sharp fangs?” Eliza asked, her expression dead serious.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Where do you get such…  No.  No, it’s just a deer.  Fluffy tail, little hooves.  You know, a deer.  Do they not have these animals where you come from?”  the Hippie demanded, looking annoyed.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Of course, but they usually don’t breathe fire…” Eliza said, trailing off as she saw the Hippie’s face growing red.  Teasing him was rather fun.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Fire?  I didn’t mention any fire,” The Hippie snapped, before suddenly looking confused and glancing at Fluffy.  “Or did I?  Maybe I forgot?”  He began to pace again and grumble to himself.  Then he suddenly whirled on Eliza.  “You’re messing with me aren’t you?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Perhaps a little,” Eliza replied with a small smile.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The Hippie snorted in frustration.  “Well, do you want to take the quest or not?  Not that it likely matters to you, but Fluffy’s wardrobe hangs in the balance while you make jokes!”  The sheep took this opportunity to glance at Eliza, and she could have sworn she saw amusement in his glassy eyes.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“I’m not sure…” Eliza began.  “I haven’t really seen any of the details yet.”  She waved at the air in front of her in mock confusion.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The Hippie looked like he was about to say something, but he must have thought better of it.  Instead, he snapped his fingers.  A prompt immediately appeared in front of Eliza:</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre7"> <span class="calibre6"> </span> </p>

   </div> 
   <p class="calibre7"> <span class="calibre6"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza couldn’t help but smile as she reviewed the quest text.  Apparently, she had really struck a nerve with the capricious god.  She glanced up to ask if Fluffy would vouch for the Hippie’s honesty but discovered that the Hippie and Fluffy had vanished and she now stood alone in the garden.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Her eyes moved back to the notification hovering in the air, her hand hesitating to accept the quest.  Despite her teasing and the god’s promises, she expected that this was going to be more complicated than the Hippie had let on.  The troll quest had taught her that much at least.  Yet she could feel a small buzz of excitement pulsing through her veins.  For some reason, the thought of another quest wasn’t as terrifying as she had expected.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Before she could hesitate or talk herself out of it, Eliza’s hand slammed down on the “accept” button, and the screen vanished.  There were no fireworks and no epic music played.  Alma’s garden was just as she had left it, the breeze gently rustling the leaves of the plants. Her gaze shifted to the dense trees that ringed the compound, and she suddenly realized that the god hadn’t given her much information – like where she might find this Silver Stag or how she was going to kill it.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Now what do I do?” Eliza murmured.</span> </p>
