   <p class="calibre7"> <span class="calibre6"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The cart rumbled and bounced below them, as Eliza and Brian made their way into the fields outside of Tollhouse Farm.  The hills in the area seemed to crest and swell like green waves, and the tall grass waved and rippled in the strong breeze.  Meanwhile, a cloudless sky lingered overhead, the occasional flock of birds flapping languidly through the air.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Despite the peaceful setting, Eliza’s thoughts were in turmoil.  She had set a timer using her system UI, and she couldn’t help but glance every few seconds at the numbers ticking down in her peripheral vision.  She’d had to estimate the time it would take for the mold to reach critical mass, and, as best she could guess, she only had a few hours left.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Things hadn’t gone to plan at all.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Beautiful day today,” Brian said, startling Eliza.  She had almost forgotten he was sitting beside her, occasionally tugging on the reins to guide the mare.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Y-yeah, I guess,” Eliza replied.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Brian glanced at her.  “I just realized that I don’t know very much about you.  How did you end up becoming an alchemist?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“It was an accident, I suppose,” she began tentatively.  “I met Alma in the market in Falcon’s Hook, and she offered to train me.”  She hesitated for a moment.  “I guess it’s not a very exciting story when I say it out loud.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Brian shrugged.  “I wouldn’t say that.  It’s always fascinating how people came to be where they are.  It’s never a straight path,” he said, a small smile upon his face.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Oh really?” Eliza asked with raised eyebrows.  “Well, how did you end up being a guard at the farm?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Hmm, so I guess that proves my point.  Mine is a rather long story,” Brian said, his eyes distant.  “First off, I’m an orphan.”  He noticed her expression and waved it off.  “It’s not that uncommon, and I don’t dwell on it.  I was lucky, actually.  I was dropped off on the steps of a church – no idea who my parents were.  But the local priest took me in, and he treated me well enough.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">He sighed slightly, adjusting their course as he caught sight of the herd in the distance.  “That little town was home, but it was a hard place to find work as I grew older.  Besides, I was a bit rebellious as a kid – a hell-raiser actually – so I had burnt some bridges.  Like top-to-bottom, there’s nothing left but ashes level burned…  Anyway, I ended up traveling to Falcon’s Hook looking for a job.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“And you found work at the farm?” Eliza asked, watching him more closely now.  This was a much more elaborate backstory than she had been expecting from the game’s NPCs.  Although, she supposed she shouldn’t be surprised after her interactions with Alma and Lord Baen.  It was sometimes difficult to remember she wasn’t talking to a real person.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“That actually took a while,” Brian replied with a shrug.  “I worked some odd jobs.  Tried my hand at carpentry for a while and then some regular farming.  It didn’t work out.  Then my dream for a time was to get picked up on one of the crews for the trade houses…”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">As he trailed off, Eliza nudged him.  “I guess that didn’t work out either?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Turns out I get violently seasick!” he said laughing and flipping the reins to bring the mare back on track as she drifted off to eat some grass.  “I couldn’t even stand on deck in the bay,” Brian continued with a self-deprecating smile.  “It’s pretty hard to do your job when you’re projectile vomiting every minute or so.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza couldn’t help but chuckle at the image of Brian reeling on deck, momentarily forgetting her quest and the ever-present timer.  “Yeah, that might not be your calling.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Brian nodded with a wry grin.  “Clearly.  I always wanted to travel, though.  You know?  Have epic adventures, see strange lands, kill a dragon!  I don’t know.  It sounds silly as I say it, but it’s still my dream to venture a little further afield.”  He glanced at the hills with a sardonic expression, clearly appreciating the irony of his last statement.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">He glanced at Eliza.  “What about you?  Does our grand alchemist have any dreams?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">A frown creased Eliza’s lips.  She found herself struggling to answer that question.  What was her dream?  She didn’t even want to think about her real life.  In-game, she enjoyed practicing alchemy and helping in Alma’s garden, but she had to admit that a part of her had enjoyed the confrontation with the troll and the players – that sense of power that came with besting an opponent.  She had never really felt that before.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“I-I’m not really sure,” Eliza eventually replied.  “Maybe I’m still working on it?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“I can understand that,” Brian said with a nod.  “Probably better than changing course every other month like myself!  When you do finally make a decision, I expect you’ll be ready to see it through.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza wasn’t as confident, but she wanted to shift the subject away from herself.  “So how did you end up at the farm?  You never really got to that part.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Oh, you’re right!” Brian said, his eyes sparkling as he glanced at her.  “It’s not really that fascinating.  I found a notice in town looking for some laborers and shepherds.  I wanted to work with the animals, but apparently, I have a knack for combat.”  He hesitated slightly.  “Or at least I didn’t fall flat on my face during the interview…</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Plus, the farm was willing to train me in melee and ranged combat and give me some experience.  Monsters and other creatures do </span><span class="calibre21">occasionally</span><span class="calibre6"> attack, so it’s a pretty good way to level.  One little step towards my dream I suppose,” he said with a sad smile.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza started to respond but stopped as a nearby shepherd raised a hand in greeting.  They were getting close to the herd now, and Eliza could make out hundreds of sheep shambling through the hills.  Shepherds stood in a loose circle around the animals, their eyes scanning the area while monitoring the sheep.  She could feel her stomach lurch again as she saw the huge number of creatures – her original goal returning in a rush.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">How long was it going to take to apply the salve?</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Hey there, Joe!” Brian called out to the nearby shepherd.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Surprised they let you off the wall,” the man said, approaching with a grin on his weathered, tan face.  A thick beard clung to his chin, and his fingers ran through his thick hair.  Instead of carrying a staff, a bow hung over his shoulder, and a sword swung at his waist – evidence that there was indeed some risk of monster attacks out in the hills.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Brian shrugged.  “I think James just got tired of yelling at me.  He was nearly hoarse by the end there.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Joe laughed, a deep rumbling sound that reverberated through his chest.  Then his eyes lit on Eliza.  “And who’s this young lady?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“My name’s Eliza,” she said quietly, glancing nervously at Brian.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“She’s a novice alchemist.  Clarice asked her to bring back some salve to treat the sheep,” Brian explained.  “Which is actually why we’re here.  Clarice instructed us to bring out a barrel of ointment and help apply it to the herd.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Joe grimaced as he glanced back at the hundreds of sheep behind him.  “Well, I can’t say that I’m excited to get started.  That’s going to take a while.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza could feel the pit in her stomach clench with a vengeance, and her eyes darted to the timer counting down in her peripheral vision.  Did they really have enough time to administer the medicine to all of the sheep?  Unfortunately, she was committed now.  It wasn’t as though she could afford to blow her cover, and she couldn’t think of a good reason to return to the farm on her own.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“It won’t be so bad if we work together,” Brian said with another shrug.  “If you want to call over the other guys, we can set up a little assembly line.  Maybe we can move the treated animals further down the hills to keep them separated from the rest of the flock.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Joe gave a nod, and a moment later, a group of shepherds hung around the wagon.  Brian thankfully took charge.  He had the foresight to bring containers for the salve and handed them out to each of the men.  They then started systematically applying the lotion to each sheep, making sure to cover their stomachs well.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Even working together, the process took quite a while.  Eliza couldn’t help but continue to glance at the timer as she worked, her unease growing with each minute that passed.  Yet no alarm had sounded from the farm in the distance even as the sun began to drift toward the horizon.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">A few hours later, Brian wiped at his brow with his sleeve.  “Whew.  I think we’re finally done!” he said, sparing a glance at Eliza.  At the same time, a notification appeared in the air before her.</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre7"> <span class="calibre6"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza was having trouble focusing on either Brian or the notification, the butterflies continuing to flutter in her stomach.  Her eyes darted to the timer, noticing that only a few minutes remained.  Had her math been wrong?  Had she screwed up her experiment somehow?  She felt like the residents should have noticed the mold by this point.  Which just left her with a single question.  Had she missed her chance to destroy the bell tower?</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“T-that wasn’t so bad,” Eliza managed to squeak out, realizing that she had been ignoring Brian’s comment.  “Are we heading back to the farm now?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Brian glanced at the sun as it was beginning to crest the hills.  “We probably should.  They’ll need to bring the herd back before nightfall anyway,” he said, gesturing at the shepherds as they slowly corralled the sheep and began urging them back toward the farm.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">As Eliza and Brian retook their seats on the wagon and began turning the mare’s head back toward Tollhouse Farm, Eliza finally heard the sound she had been dreading all afternoon.  The deep chime of a massive bell rolled over the hills, echoing slightly but still clearly coming from the direction of the farm.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The whole group froze, many of the shepherds cocking their heads and glancing at each other in confusion.  They seemed to be waiting for something.  The sound repeated another two times, and Eliza could see many of the men’s eyes widen in a mixture of surprise and fear.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Shit,” Brian murmured, his expression suddenly serious.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“What?  What’s wrong?” Eliza asked.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“That’s the alarm.  Three chimes means the farm is under attack,” he said in a dark tone.  “We need to get back quickly.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The shepherds must have had the same idea.  They grouped up, talking in hushed tones.  A moment later, a few of the men moved back to the flock to continue dealing with the sheep.  The others approached the wagon at a brisk jog.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Hey, Brian,” Joe said, his smile now gone.  “We need to hitch a ride with you, and we’re leaving some men to keep an eye on the herd.  We need to get back to the farm quickly.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Hop on,” Brian replied, gesturing at the bed of the wagon.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The men promptly piled onto the vehicle, and they took off for the farm, Brian urging the mare to move as fast as possible.  The animal was reluctant, but Brian didn’t relent, whipping at the reins every time the horse paused or slowed.  Even the irritating animal seemed to understand that something was wrong, and she managed a slow trot.  The speed made the vehicle bump and stutter more erratically, setting Eliza’s teeth on edge.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Her anxiety wasn’t helped by the group of men in the bed of the wagon.  They pulled daggers and swords from their sheaths and checked their quivers – clearly preparing for a fight.  For a moment, Eliza considered leveling with them about what they were facing.  It wasn’t like the mold could really fight back.  These people had been nothing but nice to her – even if they might be smuggling Lord Baen’s stolen cargo.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Yet she quickly shut down that idea as she realized that this would immediately lead to follow-up questions that she wouldn’t be able to answer.  She could already envision the anger and betrayal in their eyes when they realized what she had done.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">She also didn’t relish the idea of dying again – even if the game wasn’t real.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">So, she kept her mouth firmly shut, her knuckles white as she clutched one of her wands.  A few short minutes later, the wagon teetered over the crest of a hill and the farm came back into view.  The entire group froze as they witnessed the scene that was playing out in the small valley, the muffled gasps of the shepherds nearly drowned out by the clash of metal and the screams of the farm’s residents.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Oh…oh, my god,” Eliza murmured.  Never in her wildest dreams could she have imagined the scene that was playing out before her.  Her eyes were wide, and her mouth hung open as she witnessed what had happened to the farm – what she had done to these people.</span> </p>
