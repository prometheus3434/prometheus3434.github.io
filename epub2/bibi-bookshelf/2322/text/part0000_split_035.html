   <p class="calibre7"> <span class="calibre6"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza’s thoughts raced as she saw the sporelings approaching through the mists.  The heat of the flames on her back was almost oppressive, yet it didn’t seem to deter the mold monsters as they continued forward, each ponderous step another nail in their coffins.  The sporelings didn’t seem to be affected by her mist any longer, the vapor only causing a thin layer of mold to peel away from their bodies.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The remaining shepherds and Brian clutched at their weapons, preparing to make a last stand as Eliza stared at the oncoming monsters.  In the distance, the enormous sapphire bulb pulsed with a disturbing blue light, the entire structure vibrating slightly and causing the ground to tremble and shake.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">No brilliant plan materialized.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">No epic music played.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">No one was coming to their rescue.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza didn’t know what to do, and their backs were quite literally pressed against a wall of fire.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Stay behind me,” Brian said, pushing her toward the rear of the group.  He spared a momentary glance at Eliza, and she could see the fear in his eyes.  Despite that, he was still trying to protect her – the person who had caused this entire mess and killed all of these people.  Guilt swiftly colored the chaotic whirlwind of thoughts spinning through her mind.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The sporelings didn’t wait for her self-recrimination.  The front line of creatures struck the shepherds.  It was a massacre.  The men tried to swing their weapons, but they were ineffective against the insidious creatures, each blow simply launching more deadly spores into the air – which either landed on exposed flesh or were inhaled into the shepherds’ lungs where they ate away at their organs.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza watched as a creature latched onto Joe’s legs, a warning catching in her throat.  Pinned, Joe was unable to react, and another sporeling leaped at his chest, curling around his upper torso.  The creature then lifted a single arm, the mold spores shifting and tumbling erratically, before plunging the extremity into the shepherd’s throat.  His eyes bulged, and his limbs flailed helplessly, but it was already too late.  The mold immediately began eating at his insides, green veins appearing on his skin before exploding through his flesh and forming another thick cocoon.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Finally, only Brian stood in front of Eliza, swinging his sword wildly and barely managing to keep the horde of creatures at bay.  A handful of spores had already landed on his arms, and Eliza could see his flesh beginning to boil and peel away under the corrosive fungus.  Despite the pain that she knew must be wracking his body, Brian kept fighting, refusing to give up his position even as his friends died around him.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza stood frozen watching the young man.  He was dying.  She could see that clearly even without the system UI.  And what was she doing?  Standing there watching?  Frozen in indecision while these men gave up their lives for her mistake?  Doing what she always did?  Backing down – wracked by indecision.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Brian stumbled to his knees, losing his balance as a sporeling snatched at his legs.  Another creature loomed over him, preparing to deliver a death blow even as dozens of sporelings hung around them in the mists.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Is this how they would die?</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Then a small flare of anger bloomed in Eliza’s chest.  Why did it have to be like this?  Why was she being backed into a corner again?  This time it was the Hippie and Lord Baen.  But didn’t she always do this?  Allow other people to pressure her?  Her parents.  Her classmates.  Is that who she was?  Just a pushover?  A punching bag that just blindly accepted others’ blows?</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">In the back of her mind, a voice whispered, </span><span class="calibre21">you don’t have to accept this</span><span class="calibre6">.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">She wouldn’t.  Not again.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">All at once, mana flooded her body in a rush.  Eliza’s hands began moving of their own volition – dancing through an intricate series of gestures.  She gave up thinking about what spells she was casting and gave herself over to the strange feeling that permeated her body.  Shards of ice appeared in the air all around her, racing forward with terrible force and slamming into the body of the sporeling that stood over Brian.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The creature reeled backward under the barrage, but Eliza didn’t relent.  Dozens of glowing sapphire circles began to form around her and Brian as she continuously cast </span><span class="calibre21">Cold Grasp</span><span class="calibre6">.  A moment later, massive spikes of ice erupted into the air, creating a formidable barrier between the pair and the horde of sporelings.  However, she could already see the creatures beating against the barrier with their gangly limbs and the flames behind her beginning to melt the wall.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Her eyes flitted to Brian where he lay on the ground.  Mold spores clung to his skin, his arms and hands little more than mangled stumps.  He gurgled futilely, his eyes wide and panicked as he stared desperately at Eliza – pleading for help but unable to speak.  She rushed to his side, dropping to her knees.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre21">I have to save him</span><span class="calibre6">, she mentally screamed at herself.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">A part of her already knew that it was too late, but she shoved that doubting voice away, abandoning all reason as she ripped open her pack and grabbed at jars and vials.  She applied the few remaining drops of Ferntail directly to Brian’s skin, but the herbicide barely blunted the mold.  Then she used her healing potions, forcing him to swallow the crimson liquid and drenching his arms.  The contents of dozens of enhancement potions of all shapes and sizes soon followed, sloshing against his body in a rainbow of colors.  She used anything and everything at her disposal to slow the effect of the mold.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">It still wasn’t enough.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Brian’s chest rose and fell feebly, and the creatures continued to slam against her makeshift, frozen wall.  Yet she couldn’t think of anything besides saving the young man who had smiled at her.  That grin was burned into her mind.  She wanted to salvage something – anything – from this mess she had created.  She had to.  She stared at the cocktail of potions streaming down Brian’s skin.  She just needed more, but she didn’t have any other potions or ingredients.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Then a crazy thought occurred to her.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">In her desperation, Eliza began casting </span><span class="calibre21">Accelerated Growth</span><span class="calibre6">.  Dewy drops of liquid mana formed around her fingers, but it wasn’t enough – not nearly enough.  She poured her entire mana pool into the spell, feeding it every ounce of power she had left.  The droplets on her skin thickened and solidified until they formed a solid coat of liquid mana.  Then she pressed her hand to Brian’s chest.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The effect was incredible.  His body practically exploded, flowers and stems of all shapes and sizes blooming directly from his skin.  Eliza couldn’t even track the number of herbs and plants that were present, and she numbly realized that the plants must represent every ingredient in the potions she had poured on his body, each lingering plant cell responding to the effects of </span><span class="calibre21">Accelerated Growth</span><span class="calibre6">.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Vines and roots appeared along Brian’s arms, arching into the air and spiraling back down toward his body.  His flesh and bone melted away under the changes, only to be replaced a moment later with a bark-like substance.  His muscles turned into knotty ropes of vegetation.  And, through it all, Eliza stayed beside him, her hand pressed to his chest, and her mana coursing through her body – even as she watched Brian’s eyes close and his face melt away under the changes.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Then Brian’s body gave a final explosion of growth, throwing Eliza away.  Her back slammed into the ice wall, causing cracks to radiate outward from the impact and the wind to race from her lungs in a whoosh.  She fell to the ground a moment later, struggling to stay conscious as her vision swam and danced and red notifications appeared in her peripheral vision.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Brian,” she croaked, crawling back to his body as the ice walls around her finally began to crumble – the wheezing gasps of the sporelings filling the air once more.  She inched forward until she could see him again.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">He was no longer human.  That much was clear.  Brian’s body was now a roiling mass of plant-life, woven together in such an intricate pattern and containing so many different species that Eliza couldn’t tell where one plant ended and another began.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Brian!” she shouted, her heart beating frantically and her water mana still flowing through her veins in a torrent.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Then he opened his eyes.  They glowed a brilliant blue.  They weren’t the eyes of a human person, but they still looked at her with intelligence – with a sort of recognition.  She clung to that.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Brian, it’s me.  It’s Eliza,” she gasped at him, tears blooming at the corners of her eyes.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“E-Eliza?” the Brian-creature murmured, its voice coming out like the whisper of rustling of leaves.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Yes,” she replied, not sparing any attention to the crashing sound of ice around them.  Flames licked at the last remnants of her ice wall, and the rumbling continued to rock the ground around them.  “It’s me.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“W-what…?” Brian tried to say, raising his arm to touch her face.  He froze, his glowing eyes focusing on the branch-like appendage that was now his limb.  “What is this?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“I… I had to save you,” Eliza choked out.  “I had to!”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">She expected horror, anger… something.  But what she received instead was a smile.  Brian looked at her and </span><span class="calibre21">smiled</span><span class="calibre6">, despite the chaos around them and the deformed monstrosity that he had become.  Time seemed to still for a moment, and Eliza just stared at him in confusion.  The look he gave her was almost grateful.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Then time sped back up as the wall finally crumbled, and the sporelings raced toward them, their limbs flailing wildly and a thick cloud of spores filling the air.  Brian’s gaze turned toward them, and angry azure flames curled away from the orbs of energy that now made up his eyes.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“No.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">In a flash of movement, the spiraling branches that made up his arms erupted – growing at a tremendous rate and racing outward in a circle.  The spindly appendages promptly ripped the sporelings apart.  The tendrils tore at the creatures’ bodies, ripping and shredding them in a frenzy until a thick cloud of spores filled the air.  However, Brian protected Eliza from the onslaught of fungus.  His chest exploded, forming a shell of vegetation that blocked the malignant mold and seemed to absorb it into his very flesh.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“What is this?” Eliza whispered, staring at the cage of branches surrounding them, flowers blooming along their length.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“I-I don’t know,” Brian replied in a confused, distracted voice.  “I think I can grow my limbs…  It feels…”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">He trailed off, staring into space as he focused on something that Eliza couldn’t see.  Meanwhile, the ground continued to tremble before splitting open, fissures forming in the dirt.  Eliza focused on the epicenter of the tremors and found herself staring at the massive, glowing blue bulb in the center of the farm.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The plant trembled and jerked, clearly causing the earthquakes that were rocking the compound.  Cracks had formed around the enormous bulb and radiated outward through the compound.  Eliza didn’t understand what was happening.  Acting quickly, she used her </span><span class="calibre21">Inspection</span><span class="calibre6"> skill.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre7"> <span class="calibre6"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre33">Queen Cluster – Level 500 (Boss)</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre32"> <span class="calibre34">This creature has mutated to the point that it has evolved semi-sentience.  The bulb appears to be preparing to release a massive cloud of spores into the air.  So, umm, yeah.  That seems bad!  Maybe you should start running.  Just an idea…</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre32"> <span class="calibre34">Health – Unknown</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre32"> <span class="calibre34">Mana – Unknown</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre32"> <span class="calibre34">Equipment – Unknown</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre32"> <span class="calibre34">Resistances – Unknown</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre7"> <span class="calibre6"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">As Eliza skimmed the prompt, she breathed in sharply.  She stared at the bulb with newfound fear, the structure towering nearly three stories into the air.  It was sentient now?  What did that even mean?  And why was it trying to release spores?</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Her eyes darted between the bulb and the wall of flames that encircled the compound in confusion.  Maybe she was approaching this wrong.  If she were a mutant, sentient mold trapped inside a burning compound, what would she try to do?  Dread filled her stomach as the obvious answer practically slapped her in the face.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">She would try to escape.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“What is it?” Brian asked, noticing her fearful expression.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“I-it’s that bulb,” Eliza gasped, pointing at the towering plant.  “It’s about to release more spores.  If it shoots them over the walls…”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">She trailed off, but Brian seemed to pick up on the implication of what she was trying to say.  His sapphire eyes looked panicked for a brief moment before finally settling into a look of determination.  He rose abruptly, the shield of branches withdrawing back into his body.  As the barrier disappeared, Eliza could see that the sporelings were all dead, desiccated piles of mold lying around them in a circle.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Then we have to stop it,” Brian said, offering her a hand up.  As he raised the limb, the branches shifted and twined together, forming something that resembled a human hand.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza stared at the extremity.  How could he have such courage after what they had been through?  The death of the shepherds, the destruction of the farm, and the changes that had warped and corrupted even his own body.  How could he still look at her with that little grin that curled the corners of the vines that now made up his mouth?</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">And how could she back down in the face of that sort of courage?</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">She accepted his grip, and he lifted her to her feet.  At the same time, she forcefully summoned her water mana once more.  If Brian had placed his life and his faith in her – then she would try to live up to it.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“What do we do?” Brian asked calmly, waiting for her instructions.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza glanced quickly around them.  The pen and barn still lingered nearby although the surface of the structure was now coated in a thick layer of mold.  Several barrels of lanolin still rested beside the barn.  Fire would probably work – it had certainly done the trick so far.  They just needed to deliver it somehow.  Her gaze darted between the oil and the bulb in the center of the farm as she tried to think of a plan.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Brian was watching her closely, and he followed her gaze to the barrels of oil.  “I can carry the barrels.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza whirled toward him.  “No.  That’s suicide.  There won’t be time to…”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">He just chuckled, the sound drifting from his lips like the rustle of branches. Brian lifted his arms, tracing the twining vines and flowers with one limb.  “Don’t you see this body?  I’m already dead!  You gave me a second chance, and I owe you for this.  Besides, as you said before, we can’t let the mold spread.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“But…” Eliza began, the guilt in her stomach thrashing like a living thing.  He didn’t know that she had caused this; that she was responsible for his brush with death.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Don’t worry,” Brian murmured, moving closer and his vine-like fingers brushing her lips.  “It doesn’t matter.  We all grow and die, only to be reborn anew.  I can see that now.  I can see so much that I missed before.”  His glowing blue eyes peered into hers, and it felt like for just a moment he could glimpse her soul.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Promise me something,” Brian whispered.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Anything,” Eliza choked out, feeling new tears springing up in the corners of her eyes.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Just promise me that you will find your dream someday.  And when you do, don’t let anyone or anything stop you from grabbing it with both hands.  Don’t ever let it go,” he said, the branches of his face contorting into another sad smile.  “Find your own adventure.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza tried to respond, but he didn’t give her a chance.  Without warning, Brian tossed her to the side and slammed down on his arm with his other limb, severing it cleanly.  The decapitated branch spun in the air before crashing into the ground.  Stiff limbs promptly erupted from the soil, forming a massive protective dome over Eliza and trapping her inside.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“No!  Brian, don’t!” she screamed.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">He either didn’t hear her, or he simply didn’t acknowledge her pleas.  Instead, Brian raced toward the barn, his legs lengthening and stretching with each step.  In only moments, he was beside the mold-covered structure.  Spindly branches erupted from his back, snatching at the remaining barrels and lifting them into the air.  They raced back to his body before embedding themselves in the writhing vegetation that made up his back.  In one hand, she could see that he held the familiar branding wand.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Brian spared one last glance at Eliza, his glowing eyes flaring powerfully.  Then he turned to the Queen Cluster in the center of the compound.  The mold seemed to anticipate what Brian was about to do and it lurched abruptly.  The fractures running along the ground widened, shifting the blanket of mold that covered the ground and causing the entire compound to buck and heave.  Meanwhile, dozens of sporelings began to take shape, pulling themselves together from the fungus that still lingered on the nearby buildings.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">None of this deterred Brian.  He raced toward the creatures, his eyes blazing with sapphire energy.  Eliza tried to think of something – anything – to help him, but she came up short.  She was completely out of mana, and her pack was outside the cage of branches.  She was helpless and could only watch as Brian hurtled toward the Queen Cluster and its army of sporelings.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">He slammed into the mold creatures without slowing down.  The branches that were his arms whipped through the air with blazing speed, cutting many of the sporelings in half and their bodies crumbling lifelessly to the ground.  Yet the mold was legion.  For every sporeling Brian destroyed, another three filled its place, creating a veritable wall of the creatures in front of the Queen Cluster.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The sporelings raced toward Brian as one, their gangly limbs flailing and the insidious hiss of their breath filling the air in a cacophony of noise.  They launched themselves at him without any sense of self-preservation, clawing at his body in a frenzy.  He managed to destroy them at a fantastic rate, his arms contorting and whipping at the creatures and his limbs racing away from his torso to destroy any sporelings that managed to circle behind him.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Yet he couldn’t kill them all.  Several made it past his defenses, clinging to his skin and covering his body in their insidious spores.  Brian might have been resistant to the fungus, but he wasn’t immune.  The mold ate into the branches and vines that made up his body and tore at his bark-like skin.  He let out a tortured wail as the fungus ate entirely through one of his arms, the branches crashing to the ground.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza could only look on from inside her branch-prison.  She wanted to help him.  She wanted to rush to his aid.  However, she was powerless.  In her desperation, her thoughts turned to the Hippie – his irritating face appearing in her mind’s eye.  If he really was a god, then maybe he could hear her prayers.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Please,” she whispered.  “Please give me the strength to help him.”  She pleaded and begged under her breath.  “You have to help.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Brian stumbled, dropping to his knees under the endless barrage of sporelings.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Please!” Eliza cried out more urgently.  “I’ll do anything!”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Anything at all…”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">And then Hippie answered her call.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">A massive torrent of water mana flooded Eliza’s body, rushing through her veins in a tidal wave that she could barely control.  The energy was so intense that it was almost painful, the sensation making it difficult to think clearly.  A sapphire aura of power enveloped her body, expanding outward in a mist so thick that it began to blot out the scene in the courtyard.  And in the center of that maelstrom of power – in the eye of that tornado of energy – she sensed an eerie all-encompassing calm.  The feeling was fleeting, like the glimpse of a hummingbird’s wings in the middle of a hurricane.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Then it was gone – replaced with a single notification.</span> </p>

   </div> 
   <p class="calibre7"> <span class="calibre6"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza swept away the notification without even reviewing the text.  She hadn’t forgotten her goal.  Her glowing blue eyes rested on Brian’s failing form – nearly buried under the army of sporelings.  She raised a hand, and a ball of water mana began to collect in her palm.  She let it grow, feeding it every drop of the mana that filled her body; pouring her heart and soul and desperation into the spell.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Then she cast </span><span class="calibre21">Accelerated Growth</span><span class="calibre6"> one final time.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">This was no droplet or trickle.  A stream of mana – so dense that it was nearly blinding – rocketed away from Eliza’s palm, the explosion of energy slamming her back into Brian’s protective shield.  As the beam struck Brian, his body contorted.  His eyes flashed a brilliant sapphire once again, and then his body erupted outward – branches lancing in every direction and destroying the sporelings around him.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Brian’s body grew rapidly in size until he was nearly ten feet tall, his arms and legs thickening and expanding at an unbelievable rate and flowers blooming along his skin.  Using his new form, he waded through the sporelings, leaving a path of destruction in his wake as he continued his mad dash toward the Queen Cluster.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The mold seemed to anticipate that he was getting close.  Clusters of spores formed in the air, creating a barrier between the bulb and Brian.  The wall thickened and grew at an alarming rate.  The mold also mutated once again, forming thick spikes along the surface of the wall facing Brian.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">He didn’t slow.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Instead, as he approached the barrier, Brian’s legs grew and reformed, shooting him up into the air.  As he reached the top of the wall, he severed his own legs with a single well-placed blow of his arm – the extremities already reforming before he hit the ground on the other side of the wall.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">And then Brian was at the base of the Queen Cluster.  He quickly grabbed the plant, his hands and feet carving holes in its surface as he scaled the monstrous bulb.  The mold of this plant must have been more acidic than its underlings because it ate into Brian’s arms faster than he could regenerate – even with Eliza’s assistance.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">This didn’t deter Brian.  He kept going even as spores ate into his torso and his limbs melted away, reforming over and over again.  A few excruciating seconds later, he reached the apex of the bulb.  With a final roar, Brian ripped into the plant, carving a massive hole and entering the plant itself.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Seconds ticked by and Eliza’s heart thudded in her chest.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Suddenly, a massive explosion erupted from inside the Queen Cluster, mold spraying in every direction and the sides of the monstrous bulb peeling away before crashing to the ground.  The fires raged, spearing into the air and the heat and flames cascading outward in a tidal wave of destruction that incinerated any sporelings standing near the bulb.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The remaining sporelings lingering around the farm promptly collapsed, their bodies crumbling into piles of fungus. Meanwhile, spore plumes rocketed through the compound, released by the smaller bulbs lingering on the tops of each structure.  Yet the mold didn’t make it far.  The flames encircling the compound made short work of the insidious substance, and the fires raging through the farm wiped it clean.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">In the middle of it all stood Eliza, brilliant sapphire tears streaming down her cheeks as she stared at the roaring flames and the devastation.  Her fingers numbly encircled a branch of her cage, and she closed her eyes to blot out the scene around her.  She had caused this.  She had caused all of this.  And Brian had died for her mistake.</span> </p>
