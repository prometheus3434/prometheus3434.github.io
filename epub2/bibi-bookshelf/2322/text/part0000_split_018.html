   <p class="calibre7"> <span class="calibre6"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza had spent the rest of the day and the entire night in-game in Alma’s secret lab.  The hours had passed quickly as she practiced different distillation methods and combinations of basic poisonous ingredients, mixing and matching concentrations and various catalysts to assess their effects on the rabbits.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The results had been astounding.  She has found toxins that completely or partially paralyzed the small creatures, slowed their movements, caused wasting damage over time, and reduced their base statistics.  The combinations were nearly endless, and, if it weren’t for the morning sun peaking over the horizon and streaming in through the laboratory’s windows, she might have kept going for the rest of the day.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">However, there was also a limit to what she could accomplish in the lab.  The rabbits weren’t terrible test subjects, but she wasn’t certain how some of the poisons would translate to a much larger creature – such as a bear or an adult human.  She would also need to assess how the poisons would perform in combat.  At her current skill level, some of the toxins weren’t capable of killing even the level 1 rabbits, much less something more resilient.  She would likely need to use her </span><span class="calibre21">Ice Bolt</span><span class="calibre6"> and </span><span class="calibre21">Cold Grasp</span><span class="calibre6"> to compensate.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Which explained why Eliza was now walking carefully through the forest, having spent the last hour navigating the hunting trail leading away from Alma’s compound.  The trees now towered above her, the whisper of a breeze gently rustling the leaves overhead as insects chirped happily nearby.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The walk would have almost been picturesque if Eliza wasn’t planning to painfully poison and then kill an innocent forest creature.  Well, not completely </span><span class="calibre21">innocent</span><span class="calibre6">, she corrected herself.  The last bear had tried to kill her, after all.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">With that macabre thought, Eliza decided to take a quick break.  She ducked down next to a tree, carefully scanning the area around herself before opening her pack.  She had learned her lesson with the bear and the players – determined not to be caught unprepared again.  She had also left most of her money and valuable equipment at Alma’s compound just in case, taking only a few of her poisons.  If another player looted her corpse, they were likely in for a startling surprise when they found dozens of novice vials filled with various poisons.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Speaking of which, she quickly decided she should inventory her supplies.  She was beginning to get close to the same place where she had encountered the bear a few days before.  Lifting the lid of her pack, she peeked inside and identified the handful of new poisons she had created.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre7"> <span class="calibre6"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre32"> <span class="calibre47">Paralyzing Poison</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre32"> <span class="calibre48">This concoction was created by a novice alchemist with the help of an instructor.  While the toxin does not cause any immediate harm to the recipient, it will paralyze them for a short time.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre32"> <span class="calibre47">Quality:  </span><span class="calibre48">C</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre7"> <span class="calibre48"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre32"> <span class="calibre47">Wasting Poison</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre32"> <span class="calibre48">This concoction was created by a novice alchemist with the help of an instructor.  This poison applies a damage over time effect to the target, causing them to suffer damage each second for the duration of the poison.</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre7"> <span class="calibre48"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre32"> <span class="calibre47">Numbing Poison</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre32"> <span class="calibre48">This concoction was created by a novice alchemist with the help of an instructor.  This poison weakens a target, reducing its statistics and damage for a time.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre32"> <span class="calibre47">Quality:  </span><span class="calibre48">C</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre32"> <span class="calibre47">Damage:</span><span class="calibre48">  NA</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre32"> <span class="calibre47">Effects:</span><span class="calibre48">  10% reduction to target’s statistics for 60 seconds.</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre7"> <span class="calibre19"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Her current poisons weren’t a marvel by any stretch of the imagination, but they were far better than her initial attempts the night before.  For example, she had barely managed to get the paralysis duration over five seconds on her first few tries.  It had taken her nearly an hour to figure out that she needed to grind the seeds more finely before distilling the oil.  She had been kicking herself on that one once she’d figured it out.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The silver lining was that her crafting abilities had increased considerably – which no doubt had something to do with the hours she had spent reading in-game textbooks and experimenting in the laboratory.  She was nowhere near Alma’s level of skill yet, but she was still happy with her progress.</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre7"> <span class="calibre6"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">With a sigh, Eliza pulled up her map.  She could see that she was now a decent distance from Alma’s compound and maybe thirty minutes from where she had encountered the Grizzly Bear.  She had intentionally avoided heading south to the lake where she had discovered the Silver Stag.  She didn’t yet have her wands or any way to kill the stag, so it seemed rather pointless to confront any other players that might be hunting the beast.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">However, she was still in a dangerous area, and she needed to be cautious.  Eliza pulled out a Dexterity Potion that she had brewed the night before and kept the bottle in hand.  She would need the extra speed and stealth that the potion afforded if she encountered a creature.  To err on the side of caution, she also placed a vial containing the Paralyzing Poison in her pocket where it was within easy reach.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">With her preparations in place, Eliza pulled herself to her feet and continued down the path.  She walked slowly, keeping a tree beside her at all times and scanning the area further down the path before she proceeded.  As she turned a bend in the road, she caught sight of the bushes moving ahead.  Eliza immediately pressed herself against a tree, downing the Dexterity Potion in a single gulp and trying her best to keep out of sight.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">A moment later, a large grizzly stumbled out of the bushes about 20 yards ahead of her position, the animal snorting and huffing softly as it searched the forest floor.  Eliza breathed a sigh of relief when she realized the creature hadn’t detected her – at least not yet.  This was a perfect opportunity to test her poisons.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Moving quickly, she crouched beside the tree, placing her Paralyzing Poison on the ground and unstoppering the vial carefully.  Her heart was racing, and her fingers trembled slightly as she fiddled with the simple cork lid.  She forced herself to take a deep breath, which helped calm her nerves – if only slightly.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre21">It’s just a game</span><span class="calibre6">, she reminded herself.  </span><span class="calibre21">You’ll be fine.  Even if the bear decides to tear open your throat and make a snack of your cooling corpse.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Okay, that wasn’t helping.  Maybe she should just focus on her preparations.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">With the poison ready, Eliza began to cast </span><span class="calibre21">Obscuring Mist</span><span class="calibre6">.  Her fingers twined through the gestures of the spell as she whispered the requisite words, trying to keep her voice as low as possible.  The bear’s ears twitched slightly, but it gave no other sign that it had detected her presence as a globe of water began to coalesce in front of the mage.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">As soon as the orb stabilized, Eliza grabbed the poison and sprinkled its contents over the orb, the yellow substance slowly staining the sphere of water.  Alma had said she only needed to use a few drops for smaller creatures, but the bear was huge.  After emptying half of the vial onto the orb, Eliza glanced at the bear one last time, noting the way its bulk shifted as it lumbered across the forest floor.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre21">Nope, we’re going all in</span><span class="calibre6">, she abruptly decided, draining the remainder of the vial of poison as the orb before her began to glow a brilliant yellow.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">She moved to set down the now empty bottle and missed her mark, the glass vessel tinkling gently as it scraped against the base of the tree beside her.  Eliza immediately glanced up and saw the bear was staring in her direction, a low growl vibrating its throat.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre21">Shit, shit, shit</span><span class="calibre6">, she thought.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">As the bear began moving toward her, its lumbering paws gouging at the dirt and vegetation of the forest floor, Eliza desperately tried to complete her </span><span class="calibre21">Obscuring Mist </span><span class="calibre6">spell.  Her fingers fumbled through the final gestures a few times as she watched the bear closing in, sniffing at the air in great huffing snorts.  It was nearly upon her now.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The bear caught sight of her only a moment later, its eyes filled with deadly intent and a roar erupting from its throat as it barreled toward her position.  At the same time, she finished casting the spell.  The orb in front of Eliza exploded outward in an expanding golden mist that curled and coiled around her frame and billowed out toward the bear.  Focusing as best she could, Eliza tried to direct the tendrils of moisture – ordering her mist to encircle the bear’s head.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The vapor responded sluggishly, moving much too slowly for her comfort as she saw the bear charging the last few yards toward her position.  As the beast entered the yellow fog, it billowed and swirled around the bear.  The creature huffed slightly, the vapor sucked in through its nose.  The poison didn’t seem to have any immediate effect and Eliza stumbled back, terror settling heavily in her stomach.  Her eyes darting around as she looked for somewhere to run – anywhere that might offer some protection.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">She didn’t have enough time.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The creature continued its headlong charge – only a few feet away now and its paws thundering against the ground.  Eliza closed her eyes, her heart beating frantically as she accepted her fate.  This had been a stupid, stupid idea.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">A few seconds passed and... nothing happened.  Eliza opened a single eye tentatively – half expecting to see the ephemeral blue motes of energy that signaled the game’s deathscape.  Instead, she was still very much alive.  The bear had fallen on its side, its chest heaving feebly, and its eyes focused straight ahead.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">A furtive glance at her combat screen confirmed that the bear was now afflicted with a paralysis debuff, and a small timer was counting down in her peripheral vision – indicating that she had sixty seconds until the paralysis wore off.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Oh, thank god,” Eliza murmured with a relieved sigh.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">However, the next question lingered in her mind – now what?</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">This was an experiment, wasn’t it?  Maybe she should move closer and observe the effects of the poison.  She took a furtive step toward the bear, her mist drifting out of the way to make room for her as she examined the creature carefully.  The paralysis had taken longer to take hold than with the rabbits.  Maybe it was a product of the bear’s slower metabolism, its weight, or the delivery method?  She had often fed the rabbits pellets drenched in poison instead of using the mist.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The duration was also longer than she expected.  That might be due to the dosage.  So maybe the poison’s tooltip calculated the duration based on an “appropriate” dosage – which could vary wildly from creature to creature?  That wasn’t really helpful, but she could live with it now that she knew that the tooltip was inaccurate.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">As she inspected the bear and stepped around its prone body, she also noticed that it was unable to move its eyes.  Although, it seemed to be aware that she was there because its breathing quickened slightly as she neared.  As she looked on, the bear’s paw twitched, spasming slightly and causing Eliza to jump back in surprise.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre21">The paralysis must wear off gradually</span><span class="calibre6">, she thought, claws of fear clenching at her stomach.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">A glance at the debuff timer confirmed that she was running out of time.  She needed to end this quickly.  Eliza spared a glance back down at the bear as she began to cast </span><span class="calibre21">Ice Bolt</span><span class="calibre6">, the creature’s pitiful wheezing audible over the thrumming energy of her spell.  She couldn’t help but feel a little bad about this – yet Alma’s words echoed in her head.  She had no doubt that the bear would have torn her apart if she hadn’t paralyzed the creature.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">This was just the way of this world.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Then she embedded the spear of ice into the creature’s eye, blood spurting from the wound.  Eliza immediately followed up with another rapid-fire series of bolts, knowing from recent experience that the single attack wouldn’t be sufficient.  With clinical precision, icy spikes punctured each of the bear’s weak points, its lifeblood leaking out onto the ground and staining the forest floor crimson.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Just as the timer was about to expire and the bear’s limbs began to twitch more erratically, Eliza cast a final missile – ending the helpless bear’s life.  Eliza stepped back, her water mana still coursing through her veins as she surveyed her opponent.  Golden mist hung around her like a deadly halo, creating a single clear patch of ground around the bear’s corpse and Eliza.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">She could feel guilt coil in her stomach as she stared down at the bear.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">However, Eliza tamped down on the feeling, her water mana helping with that process.  When the chill energy pulsed through her veins, it felt easier to accept the things she needed to do – even if she would normally have been wringing her hands right now.  Her thoughts felt almost… clinical as she observed the bear’s body, noting that it had taken nearly five well-placed bolts to end its life.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">This had been necessary.  She had confirmed that her poisons would work – even against larger or higher-level opponents.  When her new wands were complete, she might even be able to handle other players.  The only problem was the Silver Stag.  She had no idea how she was going to tackle that creature, but she could already visualize the Hippie’s mocking expression if she showed up empty-handed.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">At this point, she didn’t want to give the irritating god the pleasure of seeing her fail.</span> </p>
