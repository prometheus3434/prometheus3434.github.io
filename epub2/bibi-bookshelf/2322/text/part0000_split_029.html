   <p class="calibre7"> <span class="calibre6"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">As Eliza stepped inside her family’s home, the AI – registering the presence of her core – immediately turned on the hallway lights.  After her meeting with Lord Baen, she had logged off for the night.  At that point, she was unable to deal with the Hippie’s antics and didn’t want to risk being blackmailed by yet another NPC.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Her day at school had been exactly the same as the hundreds before it – mind-numbing boredom interspersed with a few delightful moments of awkwardness.  However, at least her classes had given her plenty of time to dwell on her two impossible quests.  She somehow needed to steal a massive bell from a compound of armed guards that were likely smuggling stolen merchandise into Falcon’s Hook.  On top of that, Lord Baen was expecting her to stop the smuggling operation – strongly implying that she ought to kill everyone or destroy the farm.  Or both.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">He had been a little vague.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza threw her bag down on the kitchen table in frustration and decided to make herself a snack.  She wasn’t exactly anxious to log back into AO since she had no idea what she was going to do to accomplish her quests.  No brilliant idea had suddenly occurred to her during the day, and her thoughts kept spinning in an endless circle.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">As she took a seat at the kitchen counter, still deep in thought, a chime resounded through the house.  The AI promptly spoke up, “Incoming message for Eliza.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Show me,” Eliza ordered in a tired voice.  It was probably just junk mail.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">A screen flickered into existence beside her, and an email immediately came into view.  Eliza’s hand froze halfway to her mouth, her knuckles white around her fork.  “Oh shit,” she muttered, a heavy weight settling in her stomach and her appetite fleeing quickly.  Her worries about the game were now forgotten – replaced with a new problem.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Her grade report for the previous month was on the screen.  It was the usual series of “A’s” but one digit seemed out of place and held her rapt attention.  She had made a “B” in English?  Her first reaction was anger.  Ms. Jones had probably given her a poor grade on her recent paper.  The woman seemed to have it out for her in particular and kept giving her low marks in her class.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre21">Who needs to learn creative writing anyway?</span><span class="calibre6">  </span><span class="calibre21">How can you even grade a short story?</span><span class="calibre6"> she thought angrily.  The whole thing was entirely subjective – not that her parents were likely to understand that.  That thought made the writhing mass in her stomach clench.  Her mother was going to be livid…</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">As though her thoughts had summoned them, Eliza heard the front door open, and the sound of her parents’ voices drifted down the hallway.  She frantically swiped away the email, hoping that the school had delayed sending the same report to her parents.  She wasn’t exactly optimistic – especially not with her luck lately.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Her parents entered the kitchen a moment later.  “Hello, Eliza,” her father said in greeting, dropping onto the stool beside her.  “How was your day?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Umm, good,” she mumbled in reply, breathing an internal sigh of relief.  Maybe they hadn’t received the email yet.  They would have started in immediately on the nagging if they had seen the grade report.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Well, I’m jealous,” her mother replied, making her way around the kitchen in search of a snack of her own.  “Our day was just terrible.  The clinic was swamped.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Her father nodded tiredly.  “It seems there is no limit to people’s imagination.  They constantly surprise me with the new and stupid ways that they manage to hurt themselves.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“What was it today?” Eliza asked cautiously, hoping to keep the subject on her parents’ work.  That was always a safe area.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Where should I start?  We had one guy that managed to nail his hand to a board,” her father explained in an exasperated voice.  “How he did that, I have no idea.  He would have had to shoot the nail gun over top of his hand…”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Her father stopped speaking as a familiar chime resounded through the room, signaling another incoming email.  Eliza could feel her breath catch in her throat, and she closed her eyes, already dreading the conversation that she knew was coming.  Of course, this had to happen on a day that both of her parents were in a bad mood.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Eliza, what is this?” her mother asked a moment later, her voice eerily steady.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">For a second, Eliza considered not opening her eyes.  Maybe she could feign her own death – or perhaps a heart attack.  Yet she quickly realized that probably wouldn’t work since she was sitting in a room with two doctors.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">She grudgingly opened her eyes to see her mother and father staring at her expectantly.  Her mother’s hands rested on her hips, and the toe of her shoe tapped ominously against the kitchen floor.  Beside them hovered a screen showing the grade report, the lone B standing out like a sore thumb among the other grades.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“I got a B,” Eliza mumbled.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“We can see that,” her mother retorted in a dry voice.  “What happened?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“I-I think the teacher has it out for me,” Eliza tried to explain.  “She had us write a short story… and I couldn’t think of anything interesting.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Her mother grimaced.  “This isn’t the time for your grades to be slipping.  I’m sure if you had more time and you weren’t distracted with that </span><span class="calibre21">game</span><span class="calibre6">, you would have managed to write a better paper.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“It’s just one assignment,” Eliza replied in a quiet voice.  “And it’s only English.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Her mother didn’t seem convinced by Eliza’s half-hearted defense as she continued ranting, “A doctor still needs to know how to write – even if the subject isn’t covered on the medical school entrance exams.  I have to write reports all the time!”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Her mother tapped her lips in thought for a moment.  “I think I know a tutor in town that specializes in writing.  He might be able to help…” her mother trailed off, swiping at the Core on her wrist and skimming through her contact list.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza spared a pleading look at her father, hoping he might be able to step in.  He was usually the calmer of the two.  He seemed to pick up on her unspoken plea.  “I think that might be a bit much,” he suggested tentatively.  “It really is only one paper.  I’m sure Eliza can raise her grade next month or ask for some extra credit.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Her mother glanced up sharply.  “This is indicative of a larger problem.  We need to nip this in the bud.”  She hesitated for a moment.  “Either Eliza is struggling with the assignments or her attention is split.  Or both.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“It’s not the game,” Eliza squeaked, suddenly fearful as she followed her mother’s train of thought.  The prospect of not being able to play AO – to not see Alma again or work in her digital garden – was terrifying.  Even with the Hippie and Lord Baen’s irritating quests, the game was her only haven against the endless tide of schoolwork and studying.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Really?” her mother demanded.  “You spend every waking moment plugged into that headset – time that could be better spent studying.  Besides, I’m not sure I agree with the current reports showing that there are no ill effects from extended play.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Come on, honey,” Eliza’s father interjected, noticing Eliza’s expression.  “We went through all of that when we bought the equipment, and we agreed it was safe.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Comprehensive studies on the neural interface are still rather scarce, and most that do exist are funded by Cerillion Entertainment,” her mother reported.  “Besides, Eliza’s grades would suggest that the game may have some unforeseen side effects.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza could feel her anger threatening to boil over, feeding off the frustrations she had already been struggling with all day.  They always did this – talked about her like she wasn’t there.  Decided her future for her as if she was just some sort of robot that would follow along blindly.  Honestly, the Hippie and Lord Baen weren’t any better – forcing or blackmailing her to do what they wanted.  No one ever seemed to care what she thought or what she wanted to do.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“It was a single grade,” Eliza finally snapped, interrupting her parents.  Her sharp comment immediately drew their attention.  With their gaze fixed on her, she suddenly realized she may have overstepped, and her anger faltered.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“See, and now she’s acting out!” her mother said, glaring at her husband.  “Is this the sort of behavior you want to encourage – poor grades and backtalk?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Her father opened his mouth, but Eliza interjected – anger flooding her veins with renewed vigor at her mother’s comment.  This was completely unreasonable.  How could they blame this on the game?  It was just one paper.  “It has nothing to do with the game,” Eliza insisted, her frustration giving her courage.  “It was just a dumb assignment.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“We don’t get to pick which assignments we give our full effort – just as we don’t get to pick our patients.  What if your father didn’t give his emergency patients his full attention, or he tried to rationalize doing shoddy work?  People would die,” her mother insisted, her eyes flashing.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“T-this isn’t a life or death situation,” Eliza retorted, trying her best to keep her voice even, but she could still feel her voice quaver.  “This was a paper for a stupid high school creative writing class…”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“So you’re saying that you intentionally slacked off?” her mother demanded.  “That isn’t the daughter I know, and this wasn’t a problem before you started playing that </span><span class="calibre21">game</span><span class="calibre6">.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“This isn’t because of the game!”  Eliza practically shouted.  She could feel frustrated tears blooming at the corners of her eyes.  “How many times do I have to say that?  If you would only listen to me for a second instead of lecturing me, you’d understand that!”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Eliza Zhao, I will not have you speak to me in that tone,” her mother snapped.  “I have no idea what has gotten into you, but this is completely unacceptable.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Why don’t we just cool off a little,” Eliza’s father interjected.  “I’m not sure we’re getting anywhere here.”  Her mother opened her mouth to say something, and Eliza’s father held up a hand.  “Just hear me out.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“It does sound like this was a single paper for a single class – one that doesn’t affect Eliza’s entrance grades.”  Her father anticipated her mother’s next argument.  “Or her GPA if she goes back to Ms. Jones and asks for extra credit.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Her father rounded on Eliza.  “But that doesn’t change the fact that you have been spending a lot of time in that game.  And this is the first time you’ve made a ‘B’ in well… a long time,” he said, faltering slightly as he tried to recall the last time his daughter had made anything other than an ‘A.’  “We had intended for AO to be a momentary reprieve from your studies, not a replacement.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“But…,” Eliza began, dread clenching in her stomach.  Were they going to take the game away from her?</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Her father gestured for her to wait.  “On the other hand, it does at least give you an outlet and something else to think about besides studying.  You’ve seemed much happier since you started playing – you even seem excited when you talk about it,” he said, sparing a meaningful look at his wife.  “So I suggest a compromise.  If you can bring up your English grade next month, then you can keep playing.  But you need to scale back on AO when your entrance exams come up in the next few weeks.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">He looked between both women, noting that their anger had faded slightly, and they were at least considering his suggestion.  “Does that sound reasonable?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza spared a glance at her mother and saw grudging acknowledgment in her eyes.  “And the tutor…” her mother began.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“I’m not sure we need another tutor for Eliza,” her father said quickly.  “Why don’t we give her a chance to turn around the grade herself.  She also needs to learn to tackle her own problems.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">After a moment’s consideration, her mother nodded curtly.  “Fine.  But if I don’t see your grades go up next month, we’re tossing out that headset.  And I expect you to devote your full attention to your exams.”  With that, Eliza’s mother stormed out of the kitchen, ensuring that she had the final word on the subject.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“T-thank you,” Eliza softly to her father as her mother retreated.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">This earned her a sigh.  “Your mother really does have your best interests in mind – even if it doesn’t seem like it sometimes,” he replied quietly, watching Eliza.  She could see the lingering concern in his eyes.  Likely her own tirade had come as a shock to him – just as it had with her mother.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Are you okay?” he ventured.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“I-I’m fine,” Eliza said, her gaze fixed on the plate in front of her.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Yet she didn’t quite believe her own words.  Was she really okay?  It felt like so much had changed in such a short period of time.  Only a week ago, she wouldn’t have dared to confront her mother that way.  She had practically screamed at her…</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Maybe the game really was to blame.  But she didn’t want to give it up – she couldn’t.  She had grown quite fond of her in-game garden and the people she had met.  Well, maybe not the Hippie or Lord Baen, but the thought of losing Alma was almost painful.  She also couldn’t help but recall the triumphant feeling of finally defeating the troll and the players.  The way the players whispered about the Ice Witch.  Brian’s kind eyes.  It felt like she would be giving up some piece of herself.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza looked up at her father, repeating herself more forcefully, “I’m fine, but I guess I need to go study,” she added quickly, grabbing her plate and making her escape from the kitchen.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Behind Eliza’s back, her father’s gaze rested on her fleeing form, his brow furrowed in concern.  “I sure hope so,” he murmured, but his words didn’t reach Eliza.</span> </p>
