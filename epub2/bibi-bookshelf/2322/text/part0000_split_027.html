   <p class="calibre7"> <span class="calibre6"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">After fuming on the hillside for a moment, Eliza decided that she couldn’t do anything about the Hippie’s stupid nonsense.  Besides, the guards on the compound’s ramparts were likely wondering if she was a crazy person with the way she had been pacing the top of the hill muttering to herself.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Taking a deep breath, she started down toward the farm.  As she neared the walls, she realized that they were nearly a dozen feet tall, the barrier constructed of coarse logs that had been embedded into the ground.  The top of each pillar had been carved to a point, likely intended to deter intruders.  Eliza thought it seemed excessive.  She didn’t expect anyone would actually be able to scale the fortifications – at least, not a human person.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">A sentry stood on the ramparts above the gate and watched her carefully as she approached.  From this distance, she couldn’t quite make out his face or clothing in any detail, but she did notice the bow slung across his back.  At least the man made no move to reach for his weapon.  Perhaps a young unarmed girl carrying a crate didn’t warrant much caution.  She could probably use that to her advantage.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">As she neared the gate, the sentry finally came into view.  He wore a thick cloak that obscured his face and clothing – the thick material likely intended to blunt the sharp wind that whistled over the hills surrounding the farm.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The sentry hailed her, “Hey, there.  What business do you have here, girl?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“I-I’m an apprentice alchemist, and I was asked to deliver a shipment of healing potions to this farm,” Eliza called back hesitantly, trying for her best plaintive expression.  She looked around in confusion for a moment.  “At least, I’m really hoping this is the right place…”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The guard cocked his head slightly in thought, and he watched her carefully.  Eliza felt her stomach lurch.  She didn’t really have a good reason for visiting the farm, and she was going to have to rely on her “innocent alchemist” persona.  She had noticed that this was starting to become a trend.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“I don’t recall hearing anything about a shipment of potions,” the man finally answered in a puzzled voice.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Really?” Eliza asked, her face falling.  “I traveled all this way… Maybe they gave me the wrong instructions?  I hope I didn’t make a wrong turn.  My master is going to be furious with me for wasting an entire day…”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The guard held up a staying hand as he noticed Eliza getting upset.  “Don’t worry yourself.  If you’re an alchemist, maybe it wouldn’t hurt for you take a look at the animals.  Clarice mentioned the other day that some have taken sick.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The man began pacing down the length of the ramparts.  “Just give me a second.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza had to suppress a victorious smile as she saw the gate begin to drift open a few moments later.  Maybe she was getting better at this whole deception thing.  However, she had to quickly school her expression back to something more neutral as the guard appeared in the entrance.  He approached her with a carefree step, pushing back at the hood of his cloak.  Eliza was forced to do a double take as she saw his face.  The sentry couldn’t have been more than twenty years old, with tousled auburn hair and gentle eyes.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Hey there,” the man said in greeting, offering her a hand.  “My name’s Brian.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza just stared at his hand for a moment, before realizing that she was supposed to shake it.  Then she remembered that she was still holding the crate of potions and shifted it awkwardly.  “Ahh, sorry.  You have your hands a bit full,” Brian said with a smile.  “And that looks heavy!  Why don’t I give you a hand?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">With that, he gently took the crate from Eliza.  She wasn’t expecting the movement, and she fumbled in handing it to him.  A moment later, the crate tumbled to the ground, vials scattering in every direction with a loud clatter and the tinkle of glass.  Eliza immediately dropped to her knees, grabbing at the vials and trying to turn over the crate.  Her enhanced </span><span class="calibre21">Dexterity</span><span class="calibre6"> apparently didn’t cure her social awkwardness.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“I-I’m sorry,” she muttered.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre21">Yeah, okay.  I’m definitely not getting better at this</span><span class="calibre6">, she thought morosely.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Brian knelt beside her, a rumbling chuckle escaping his lips.  “Don’t worry.  Mistakes happen.”  Meanwhile, he reached for the vials and helped her get everything back in order.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The only saving grace was that the majority of the potions were still intact, the thick glass absorbing most of the impact.  As Eliza reached for the last potion, Brian’s hand brushed hers, and she glanced up quickly.  She realized that he was close.  Much, much closer than she had expected.  And his eyes were a brilliant brown – the color reminding her unmistakably of autumn.  She caught herself staring, and she glanced down quickly.  Hopefully, he hadn’t noticed.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Well, this was a good way to break the ice,” Brian said with a smile.  “But I didn’t catch your name.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Ahh, I-I’m sorry,” Eliza murmured.  “My name is Eliza.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Well, it’s a pleasure to meet you, Eliza,” Brian said cordially, hefting her crate under one arm and offering her a hand up.  “Why don’t you follow me inside?  We can go visit Clarice and let you take a look at the animals.  Even if you don’t have the right place, I bet she’ll need to order some sort of healing tonics.  Maybe that way you could bring back some good news for your master.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“T-that sounds… perfect actually.  Thank you,” Eliza replied, tentatively accepting his hand.  The skin of his palm was calloused, and she couldn’t help but marvel at the way his skin felt so real – realizing that this was one of the first times that she had actually touched someone in-game.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">With that, Brian led her into the compound.  Eliza’s eyes widened as she stepped inside.  The compound was much bigger than it had appeared from the hillside, multiple barns and farmhouses filling the interior.  Dozens of people trod the dusty dirt roads between the building, attending to their chores and work.  Her observation from the hillside stayed with her – this place looked more like a small town than a farm.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">As they passed the center of the farm, she forced herself not to stare at the bell tower.  It seemed even larger when she was standing below the structure, the tower stretching several stories into the air.  The structure was built of thick boards and beams, and a heavy rope hung from the center.  A ladder rested against the side of the building’s frame, likely providing a way to service the top of the tower.  However, even if Eliza could somehow get to the top, she had no way of retrieving the massive bell, let alone take it anywhere.  It was as tall as she was.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Stupid dumbass god,” she muttered under her breath.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“What was that?” Brian asked, turning to look at her over his shoulder.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“N-nothing,” Eliza stuttered.  “I was just saying that this is place is huge.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Ahh, is this your first time at Tollhouse Farm?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Y-yes,” Eliza said.  “I’ve never been this far outside of Falcon’s Hook before.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Brian chuckled.  “Well, the distance is a problem.  We need to be self-sufficient out here in the middle of nowhere.”  He gestured at the walls.  “We’ve also been having some trouble with the local wildlife – which is why you found me manning the walls.  Some of our flock has gone missing of late, so we’ve been taking additional precautions.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">As Brian spoke, he led Eliza deeper into the compound, heading for the northeastern part of the miniature town.  A few of the other farm workers spared her a curious glance, but no one stopped to confront them.  She was beginning to wonder what Lord Baen was concerned about.  Brian seemed nice, and from what she could tell, Tollhouse Farm looked like a normal farm – not that she had much experience with farms, of course.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">However, she was still a bit confused about the size of the operation.  As they walked through the compound, they passed what appeared to be a full-fledged smithy.  The ring of hammer striking metal echoed through the air and Eliza could feel the heat of the forge as they passed.  Why would a farm need a blacksmith?  Maybe shoeing the animals?</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">She realized she had been lost in her thoughts and Brian was now glancing at her expectantly.  “I’m sorry, what did you ask?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“You seem about as out of it as me,” he replied with another chuckle, his eyes flashing with humor.  “I swear I was dead on my feet when I took my post this morning.  Probably why I don’t remember any mention of a potion delivery.  But I was asking how long you’ve been an alchemist.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“A few weeks,” Eliza replied cautiously.  “I’m not really an experienced alchemist – I’m just an apprentice.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Well, I’m just a lowly sentry,” Brian said with a small smile.  “So, I won’t hold that against you.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza wasn’t really sure what to do with that, or how to respond to the friendly smile on the Brian’s face.  Her experience with most of the people she met in-game was that they were either only looking out for themselves or they were a little unhinged – or both.  The Hippie was a perfect example.  She wasn’t really sure what to do with someone who just seemed genuinely nice.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">She was saved from having to make small talk with Brian as the pair reached a set of pens along the northern part of the compound.  Eliza could see that rough wooden fences had been constructed along the wall adjacent to a massive barn.  Crates and barrels had been lined up beside the structure against the fence, and her </span><span class="calibre21">Inspection</span><span class="calibre6"> ability immediately revealed that these containers held wool and lanolin.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza froze as she saw a flock of sheep milling in the pen and bleating softly.  Of course, they were sheep.  Should she have expected anything different from the Hippie?</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Hey Clarice,” Brian called out, catching the attention of a woman standing near the pens and talking to a few shepherds.  She must have been in her early forties, her skin tanned from long days in the sun and rope-like muscle visible beneath the skin of her arms.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Brian,” Clarice greeted the man curtly, waving off the other shepherds as she turned her attention to the pair.  “Shouldn’t you be at the gate?  James will skin you if he finds out you left your position… again.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Brian grimaced slightly.  “Well, this time I had a good reason, at least,” he replied, gesturing at Eliza.  “This is Eliza, and she comes bearing potions!”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Clarice’s forehead wrinkled in confusion as she stared at Eliza, her no-nonsense gaze making her feel uncomfortable.  “I don’t recall scheduling a delivery,” she said bluntly.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“I-I might have gotten the location wrong,” Eliza stuttered, her gaze dropping to the ground under the older woman’s scrutiny.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“It didn’t seem right turning her away at the gate after she traveled such a long way and I thought I’d check with you,” Brian amended hastily.  “Besides you mentioned that a few animals had taken sick…”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Clarice grunted.  “You look pretty young to be an alchemist,” she said, inspecting Eliza suspiciously.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“I-I’m just an apprentice,” Eliza murmured.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Perfect,” Clarice said sourly, glancing pointedly at Brian.  “Who’s your master?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Alma,” Eliza offered quickly.  “She is pretty well known in Falcon’s Hook…”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Hmm, I’m familiar with her work.  In that case, you might not be </span><span class="calibre21">entirely</span><span class="calibre6"> useless,” the older woman grunted.  “Well, when life gives you lemons…  Maybe we can take advantage of your unexpected visit,” the woman said, her gaze more thoughtful now as she gazed at Eliza.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Coming from Clarice, that’s glowing praise,” Brian said with a laugh.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">This earned him the penetrating attention of the gruff woman, her eyes flicking back to the sentry.  “Hmph, you better get back to your post before someone notices that you’re missing.  I can take it from here.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Brian nodded curtly and handed the crate of potions back to Eliza.  His hand brushed hers once again during the exchange, and their eyes met.  “You should be in good hands,” he said with a smile.  “It was a pleasure to meet you, Eliza.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Y-you too,” Eliza murmured, but Brian had already turned and started back to the gate.  She couldn’t help but watch him leave – for some reason feeling a little sad to see him go.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Well, don’t just stand there gawking, girl,” Clarice said, snapping Eliza back to herself.  “Set down your crate on that post there and I can show you the flock.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Okay,” Eliza said, following the older woman’s instructions.  She felt strangely out of her element here – suddenly missing the quiet of Alma’s cottage and the nearby forest.  It was just beginning to sink in that she was a </span><span class="calibre21">long</span><span class="calibre6"> way from home, amid a bunch of strangers.  Oh, and she was also lying about why she was there.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">She couldn’t decide at that moment who she hated more, the Hippie or Lord Baen.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Clarice was oblivious to Eliza’s inner turmoil, leading her into the pen and closing the gate behind them.  The pair approached the flock of sheep milling about the enclosure.  The animals seem to perk up slightly when they caught sight of Eliza and several trotted up to her, rubbing their heads against her thighs and stomach in a way that reminded her of Fluffy.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre21">Maybe sheep just love me?</span><span class="calibre6"> she wondered.  </span><span class="calibre21">Worst superpower ever…</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Brian mentioned that some of the sheep were sick,” Eliza ventured tentatively, looking at the animals beside her.  They certainly didn’t seem ill.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Clarice sighed.  “That boy doesn’t know the first thing about animals or medicine.  It’s all that James can do to keep him on the wall where he belongs.  What he should have said was that we’ve been battling some infections.  Here let me show you.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The older woman stooped and gently tugged at a sheep’s leg.  The animal reluctantly raised its hoof and Clarice parted the thick fur on its belly with her fingers.  Eliza had to crouch to see clearly, but she could make out scratches along the animal’s stomach, red skin radiating out from the injuries and indicating that the wounds were infected.  Her brow furrowed in confusion as Clarice showed her that the scratches riddled the length of the sheep’s stomach.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“I see the infection,” Eliza murmured.  “Is this the same on every sheep?” she asked, tracing one of the wounds with a gentle finger.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Pretty much,” Clarice answered bluntly.  “But feel free to look for yourself.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza spent some time inspecting the animals around her.  Nearly every sheep in the enclosure had the same sorts of scratches along their stomach – although not all of the wounds looked infected.  In some cases, the injuries were clearly fresh, the scratches not yet having scabbed over and dots of blood staining their wool.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Do you have any idea how this happened?” Eliza asked, some of her hesitation falling away as she considered the animals.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Clarice face pinched, and she looked to the side for a brief moment.  “That’s not clear.  The shepherds keep an eye on their flock when we take them outside the compound to graze, but it’s impossible to watch every animal all of the time.  Maybe they found some stickers in the hills or something,” she added with a shrug.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza cocked her head to the side as she listened to Clarice’s explanation.  She had just trudged through the hills to make it to the farm.  The underbrush was pretty sparse, and she had only witnessed tall grasses dotting the hills.  Maybe a single sheep could have wandered into some strange bushes or something, but dozens?  Despite Clarice’s explanation, Eliza had also noticed quite a few shepherds in the hills.  It seemed unlikely that a whole flock could have been injured without anyone noticing.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre21">This is really weird</span><span class="calibre6">, she thought, her fingers tracing another batch of scratches along a sheep’s stomach.  What was even more strange was that the bushy wool should have offered some protection from normal plant life.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Acting on instinct, Eliza used her </span><span class="calibre21">Inspection</span><span class="calibre6"> skill on the sheep in front of her.  Several portions of its wool were suddenly illuminated in blue, tracing matted lines in the hair that Eliza hadn’t noticed before or had assumed were natural.  The bands were evenly spaced… almost like something had been strapped to the animal.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“So, do you think you can help?” Clarice asked, interrupting her thoughts.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“I-I think so,” Eliza replied hesitantly.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Thinking quickly, she realized she needed to buy herself some time to regroup with Lord Baen.  Besides, she had no way to retrieve the bell in the tower looming over the town right now (if it was even possible) and she had a few choice words she needed to share with the Hippie for giving her yet another ridiculous task.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“The healing potions I brought might be partly effective,” Eliza began, thinking carefully.  “But they might not deal with the infection completely – only close the wounds.  I’ll need to speak with Alma about a better solution – maybe some sort of salve.  I could return in a couple days maybe?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">As Eliza finished speaking, a prompt appeared in the air before her.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre7"> <span class="calibre6"> </span> </p>

    </table> 
   </div> 
   <p class="calibre7"> <span class="calibre6"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza reviewed the notice with a single raised eyebrow before swiping away the prompt.  The Hippie sure seemed fond of sheep puns lately.  Then she turned back to Clarice.  “What do you think?” she ventured tentatively.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Clarice grunted in acknowledgment.  “That may work.  Just let Brian know on the way out that you’ll be heading back in a few days and I’ll alert the other sentries to keep an eye out for you.  Can you make your way back to the entrance by yourself?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Y-yes,” Eliza replied nodding quickly.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">A few minutes later, Eliza found herself standing on the hills outside of the compound.  Brian hadn’t been at the gate when she returned – having been replaced by another sentry who had watched her hawkishly as she exited the compound and started the trek back to Falcon’s Hook.  In contrast to Brian, the man hadn’t spoken more than two words, his mouth pinched into a grim line.  She hoped that she hadn’t somehow gotten Brian in trouble by making him leave his post.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">As she crested the hills ringing the compound, Eliza’s eyes returned to the farm once more and her brow furrowed in thought.  Her gaze lingered on the bell tower and the pens on the north side of the farm.  The Hippie’s impossible task aside, something had definitely felt off.  However, she couldn’t quite place her finger on it.  Maybe Lord Baen would know what to make of her observations.</span> </p>
