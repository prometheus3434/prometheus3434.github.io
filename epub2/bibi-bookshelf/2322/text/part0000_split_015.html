   <p class="calibre7"> <span class="calibre6"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Damn it,” Eliza muttered.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">After respawning, she was now standing in Alma’s garden.  The sun had lazily moved toward the horizon, casting long shadows where the light drifted across the trees ringing the compound.  Eliza slumped to the ground, her thoughts focused on the encounter with the players.  An idle hand rubbed at her throat, and she could still feel a dull pain there – her mind clinging to the memory of her death despite the fact that she was now very much alive.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza noticed her bag resting on the ground beside her, and, with a hollow pit in her stomach, she opened it slowly.  She soon discovered that her entire stash of potions was gone.  Her coins were also missing, not that she’d had much money to begin with.  The only silver lining was that the other players hadn’t bothered to take her remaining ingredients.  She could only assume that there was little market in-game for selling alchemy materials at this point.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Closing her eyes, Eliza tried to stay calm.  How was she supposed to finish this insane quest?  Assuming she could somehow kill the lightning-fast creature, she still had to contend with the other players who were clearly hunting the Silver Stag.  She also hadn’t missed their mention of a bounty.  Eliza had the almost irresistible urge to strangle the Hippie the next time she saw him, and she could already visualize her fingers wrapping around his irritating throat.  He had omitted some important information.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre21">A normal deer, huh?</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“What are you doing out here, girl?” Alma asked, shuffling up beside her.  The older woman’s cane made a rhythmic thump as she approached.  As she saw Eliza’s pale face, her eyes widened in shock.  “Are you okay?  You look like you’ve seen death itself.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza could only manage a weak chuckle.  “You aren’t too far off.  Some players in the forest killed me, and I respawned here.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">A flash of anger lit Alma’s face before she managed to school her expression back to something more neutral.  “Well, then I suppose it’s lucky that you’re a traveler too.  If you had been a resident of this world, you wouldn’t be coming back.”  Seeing that this didn’t exactly cheer Eliza up, Alma continued, “Why don’t you come inside?  I’ve just finished brewing some tea.  It would probably do you some good.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Okay,” Eliza muttered, tiredly rising to her feet.  She didn’t expect that tea was going to solve her problems, but neither would moping in the garden.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The pair entered Alma’s cottage, and Eliza took a seat at a small, rough-hewn wooden table.  Her elbows rested against the coarse surface as she tugged off her glasses and rubbed at her eyes – her thoughts still troubled.  A moment later, she heard a soft thump in front of her and opened her eyes to find a mug resting on the table, steam drifting atop its surface.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Cantail Root mixed with some dried fruit.  It improves the circulation,” Alma said, taking a seat opposite Eliza.  “These old bones need a little invigoration every so often.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza sniffed at the tea skeptically and was surprised to find that it smelled like oranges – albeit rather muted.  She took a hesitant sip, and a notification immediately appeared in her peripheral vision.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre7"> <span class="calibre6"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre32"> <span class="calibre34">Consumed Cantail Root Tea</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre32"> <span class="calibre34">Stamina regeneration increased by 5/second.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre32"> <span class="calibre34">Duration 30 minutes.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre7"> <span class="calibre34"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza was surprised to see the notification, although she supposed that this was the first time she had tried eating something in-game.  It was interesting that even the food in AO had certain properties and she wondered idly if she could receive other bonuses for more complicated meals.  She had always enjoyed cooking.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“So, tell me what happened,” Alma said, jarring Eliza out of her reverie.  The older woman’s eyes were fixed on Eliza’s face, and she found it difficult to meet her gaze.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza wasn’t really certain where to start.  It wouldn’t make sense to tell Alma about how she had been killed without first explaining why she had gone out into the forest in the first place – which meant bringing up the irritating, homeless god.  Still, she found herself strangely compelled to tell Alma the truth.  Maybe she was just tired of keeping secrets.  As she ventured a glance at the kindly woman’s face, waiting calmly for Eliza to begin, she made a decision.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“I-I was approached by a strange young man about a week ago, and he told me that he was a god,” Eliza began tentatively.  When Alma didn’t reply – or break out laughing – Eliza continued, “He gave me a quest to kill a troll north of town.  I actually managed to kill the monster by brewing a poison using some herbs I found in the forest.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">She hesitated, finding it strange to tell the story aloud, since it sounded crazy even as she told it.  Yet Alma made no attempt to interrupt, and she waited patiently for Eliza to continue.  “When you asked me earlier why I was going into the forest… I-I lied.  This god wants me to slay the Silver Stag and collect its pelt.  I managed to find the animal by following a stream to a lake deep in the forest, and…”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza trailed off, wincing as she recalled the encounter – both how easily the stag had slain one of the players and how quickly she had been captured and killed.  “A group of travelers attacked the stag while it was drinking, but it killed one and got away.  It was incredibly fast.  I could barely follow its movements.  Then the travelers managed to capture me, and they… they killed me and took my potions and money.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">As she finished speaking, Eliza could feel frustrated tears blooming at the corners of her eyes, unable to will them away.  She swiped at her eyes with the back of her hand, her cheeks flushed with embarrassment.  She couldn’t believe that she was crying in front of Alma.  This was supposed to be a game.  Why did everything have to feel so real?</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Well, that’s certainly an interesting tale.  Although, I’m certain I just received the abbreviated version,” Alma finally said with a small chuckle.  “To think my apprentice would become the target of a god…  I assume he was a young man dressed in rags?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza looked up sharply, her mouth dropping open in surprise.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Ahh, it seems I hit the mark,” the older woman continued.  “Then you indeed met with the water deity – as unfortunate as that might be.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“You’ve met him?” Eliza asked, finally regaining the power of speech as she shook off her surprise.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Alma grimaced.  “Once.  I wouldn’t wish to repeat the exchange.  Yet his tasks usually come with a reward – just not always the one you expect.”  A thoughtful look flitted across the alchemist’s face.  “I think I can help you, girl.  I can’t complete your task for you, but perhaps I can offer some guidance.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“T-thank you,” Eliza said, taken aback by the older woman’s support.  She had almost forgotten what it felt like for someone to listen to her and then offer to help with her problems.  It felt like a weight had been lifted from her shoulders.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“It sounds like you face two challenges.  The first is finding a way to slay this Silver Stag – which sounds like it won’t be easy,” Alma said, her voice sounding distracted as she stared off into space, deep in thought.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“And the second problem?” Eliza nudged the older woman to continue.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Ahh, that would be the other travelers.  If they’re also hunting this creature, then you need to find some way to defend yourself – either by incapacitating them or killing them,” Alma stated matter-of-factly.  Eliza was forced to do a double take hearing the usually compassionate and friendly old woman speak so easily about killing others.  She spent most of her time brewing healing potions for sick townsfolk, after all.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Yet a hollow weight settled in Eliza’s stomach.  It didn’t matter if Alma planned to help her.  Eliza had no flair for combat – as the encounter with the bear had clearly demonstrated.  “I have no idea how to kill even easy creatures, much less a team of other travelers,” she muttered.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Don’t sell yourself short, my dear,” Alma replied sharply, causing Eliza to glance up in surprise.  She noted that the normally-kind woman’s gaze was steely as it held her own.  “You killed a troll after all – no small task for a novice water mage.”  Then she hesitated as a thought occurred to her.  “Speaking of which, how exactly </span><span class="calibre21">did</span><span class="calibre6"> you kill the troll?  You mentioned poison?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Uh, like I said, I brewed a poison using plants I found in the forest,” Eliza explained, looking down at her hands in embarrassment.  She doubted that Alma would appreciate that she had used her herbalism training to kill another creature.  “I didn’t know what I was doing, so I basically just included every poisonous plant I could find in the mixture.  The result was some sort of unidentified poison.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Alma nodded along with this explanation.  “It sounds like you got lucky.  On the other hand, luck is often the mother of invention.  How did you administer the poison?  Trolls are notoriously territorial.  Did you sneak up on it?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Sort of,” Eliza murmured, recalling the event vividly.  “It was asleep in its cave, and I figured out that I could sort of… pause casting </span><span class="calibre21">Obscuring Mist</span><span class="calibre6"> – which causes the ball of water to linger in the air.  I then poured the poison on the sphere and completed the spell, which created a poisonous mist,” Eliza explained awkwardly, feeling a little silly.  In retrospect, she was surprised that she hadn’t gotten beaten to a bloody pulp.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">On top of that, she could only imagine that Alma thought she was a terrible person.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza ventured a glance at the older woman, only to find a proud smile plastered on Alma’s face, the wrinkles around her eyes crinkling.  “Delightful.  What a creative way to administer the toxin,” Alma said, almost sounding excited.  “I’ve considered using water magic as a vector for healing and toxins in other capacities… but the mist is a surprising adaptation.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Alma’s gaze refocused on Eliza.  “Have you been able to repeat the experiment?  Pausing the spell, I mean.  That might provide an effective means of fighting the players since you have some control over the mist itself.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“I actually haven’t tried,” Eliza said.  Although, she didn’t see how she could manage to cast the spell in the middle of a battle.  She had only managed the feat with the troll because it had been asleep.  “I’m not really sure it would work, though,” Eliza muttered.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Why ever not?” Alma asked in surprise. “I think you’re on to something there.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“It’s too slow,” Eliza explained, her voice downcast.  “I have to pause the spell and then add the poison.  During a fight, that would be impossible.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Hmm, I see,” Alma said slowly, her eyes clouded in thought.  “It seems that we would need to find a way to administer the poison more quickly.  If we could reduce the spellcasting delay, then we could effectively weaponize the mist.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Alma murmured to herself, distractedly.  “We need a way to pour the poison… or inject it…  Ahh, I think I have an idea!” the older woman exclaimed, smacking the table with her palm.  “I have a friend in Falcon’s Hook that specializes in engineering projects.  His name is Evan Crown and he creates custom instruments for people in town.  I think he might be able to craft a staff that would allow you to inject the poison – perhaps as some sort of cartridge.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza couldn’t help but look at the older woman in surprise.  That was actually a really good idea – assuming it was even possible. Yet as soon as she began getting her hopes up, they came crashing back down.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“You would just need to pay him a little coin,” Alma continued.  “He might actually take a fancy to a project like this and offer a discount.  I know he gets tired of repairing clocks and dock machinery.  Something like this might be a welcome relief.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza couldn’t help but grimace.  The only problem was that the players had stolen the small stash of coins she had accumulated running errands for Alma.  She hesitated at that thought.  Speaking of a “stash,” she couldn’t help but recall the mountain of junk in the troll’s cave – which was likely still lying there untouched.  Perhaps she had been a little too hasty in storming off after the Hippie recovered Fluffy’s hairbrush.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre21">I just hope it’s still there.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“I think I might know where to find some money,” Eliza began tentatively.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“That doesn’t sound ominous at all,” Alma replied with a small smile.  “But knowing you, I’ll assume that you don’t have anything nefarious in mind.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Besides creating some sort of poison staff?” Eliza asked with a hesitant grin of her own.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The older woman barked out a laugh.  “Fair point.  I wouldn’t have expected my shy little apprentice to start inventing poisons – but I suppose you can’t judge a book by its cover.”  With that statement, the conversation devolved into friendly banter and a discussion of poisonous herbs.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">As Eliza sipped at her tea and enjoyed the conversation with Alma, she felt a wave of relief wash over her.  She now had a tentative plan.  While it still didn’t address how she was going to deal with the Silver Stag, maybe her new weapon would at least offer a way to deal with the players.  It was a start, and she couldn’t help but feel a little excited at the prospect.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Tomorrow she would visit Evan Crown.</span> </p>
