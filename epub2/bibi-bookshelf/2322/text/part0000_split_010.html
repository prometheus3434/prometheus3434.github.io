   <p class="calibre7"> <span class="calibre6"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza sat by a makeshift campfire she had built in a clearing a few yards away from the Troll Bridge.  She had discovered during the last few in-game days that the troll wouldn’t attack her if she didn’t actually step onto the bridge itself.  This seemed a bit strange, but Eliza assumed the creature must be intensely territorial.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Despite its appearance, the troll was quite fast.  There was enough traffic on the road that she was able to watch multiple groups pass the bridge each day.  By her estimates, the troll had killed over half of them and had laid waste to whole groups of players by itself.  Stealth didn’t seem like it would work and there was no reasoning with the idiotic creature.  The only players that had survived were those smart enough to hand over their gold or abandon their friends, using them as decoys as they ran away.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza was currently grinding the seeds of a Caracas Leaf into a fine powder.  Several small vials were scattered on the ground around her filled with various colored powders – the product of her work over the last few days.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Alma had always focused on healing herbs and combinations in the potions she brewed.  Most people only wanted to heal their wounds or ailments.  However, just like in the real world, a large number of the in-game plants were quite poisonous, and, in some cases, certain parts of the plant had potential healing properties while others were fatal.  As a result, Eliza had learned to identify a number of poisonous plants as part of studying under the older woman.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">She had spent the last few days preparing and experimenting.  She had scoured the nearby woods for plant life, her </span><span class="calibre21">Herbalism</span><span class="calibre6"> and </span><span class="calibre21">Identification</span><span class="calibre6"> skills making it easier to pick out useful plants and fungi in the forest.  She had then ground up the substances and boiled down those plants into a fine powder.  Her goal was to make an extremely potent poison.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Because she had decided she was going to try to kill the troll by surreptitious means.  It was the only chance she had against him without any sort of fighting skills.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“It has been </span><span class="calibre21">days</span><span class="calibre6">,” a voice moaned from the other side of the fire.  “Are you done yet?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza sighed and willed herself to be patient.  If it wasn’t already challenging enough to invent an in-game poison, she had been forced to put up with the Hippie’s whining the entire time.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“I thought gods were supposed to be aloof and answer prayers or something,” Eliza replied.  “Don’t you have anything else you could be doing?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Not really,” he replied, waving his hand lazily in the air.  “I delegate all of that stuff.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Fluffy edged over to Eliza and sniffed at one of the powders.  She slapped him gently on the snout, and he jumped back, glaring at her.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“It will kill you,” she explained simply.  “Or at least it would kill a normal sheep.”  This earned her a soft snort, and the sheep moved back over to the Hippie.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">She eyed the finely-ground powder in the mortar and the other vials around her.  She was finally ready to make her poison.  She reached out and grabbed the pan that was resting over the fire and carefully poured some of the boiling water into one of her vials.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Then she began adding the powders to the vial one at a time.  She didn’t really have an easy way to experiment with making the poison – or any way to test it – and she wasn’t certain what the troll might be resistant to.  So, she was basically throwing the farm at him – or at least every poisonous plant in the nearby forest.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">As she finished pouring in the last powder, Eliza stoppered the bottle and then shook it gently.  As the ingredients mixed, the vial began to glow a vibrant green, and she used her </span><span class="calibre21">Identification</span><span class="calibre6"> ability on it.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre7"> <span class="calibre6"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre32"> <span class="calibre43">Unidentified Poison</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre32"> <span class="calibre44">This concoction was created by a novice alchemist using crude instruments.  While it certainly looks poisonous, its potency and effects are unknown.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre32"> <span class="calibre43">Quality:  </span><span class="calibre44">B</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre32"> <span class="calibre43">Damage:</span><span class="calibre44">  Unknown</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre32"> <span class="calibre43">Durability:</span><span class="calibre44">  1/1</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre7"> <span class="calibre6"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza stared at the vial in her hand in shock.  She had never seen a “B” quality potion before and her novice potions were typically C-quality or lower.  It was a little startling, although she supposed that it was worth it after spending days gathering and preparing ingredients.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">As she finished, Eliza received another set of notifications.</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre21">A couple levels and a new skill.  Not too shabby.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza was starting to feel a bit more confident that she could pull this off.  She placed the vials carefully in her pack and put away her remaining equipment.  Glancing up, she noted that she still had a few more hours until sunset.  She might be able to make an attempt at the troll before the end of the day.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Okay,” she said aloud.  “It’s show time.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">When she didn’t receive a response, Eliza glanced over at the Hippie and saw that he was sound asleep.  This time, Fluffy was using the young man as a pillow, resting his head on the god’s stomach.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Really?” Eliza muttered.  Although she supposed it was for the best.  The god’s constant nattering would probably just distract her.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">With another sigh, she started toward the bridge.  No players or NPCs were within sight, and she knew that the troll typically retreated back down into the gorge after each encounter.  She guessed that he had a cave or lair down there somewhere.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">That meant she needed to traverse the narrow trail leading down into the chasm.  She picked her way forward carefully, one hand always resting against the stony cliff face to provide balance.  Some portions of the trail narrowed to the point where she couldn’t place both her feet side-by-side.  Luckily, she made it to the bottom of the gorge with only a few close calls.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre21">Stage 1 complete</span><span class="calibre6">, she thought as her feet touched down on solid earth.  She glanced behind her, wondering how she was going to make it back up.  She considered sourly that her inevitable respawn would probably expedite that process.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Now she needed to find the troll’s lair.  A fast-flowing river rushed through the bottom of the gorge, leaving little room on either side.  Eliza had watched the troll carefully after it defeated the players.  It tended to gather the loot, climb down the columns supporting the bridge and then move northwest along the river.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">She made her way forward carefully, clutching her pack against her side.  With the sun setting, the gorge was cast in dark shadows, making it difficult to pick out her footing.  At the next step, the ground crumbled underneath her and she listed to the side.  She barely managed to catch herself before she fell, her hand grasping frantically at vines that grew along the cliff face.  She managed to stabilize herself.  Barely.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Taking a moment to catch her breath, Eliza continued forward.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">A few minutes later, she discovered a large cave carved into the side of the ridge.  Bones littered the ground around the entrance, many of which looked distinctly humanoid.  Eliza started labeling the bones before she could stop herself.  </span><span class="calibre21">Humerus.  Tibia.  That looks like a clavicle.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">She shook her head.  She should be concentrating right now.  Eyeing the cave entrance, she took a deep breath to steel herself and stepped toward the entrance and peered inside.  The opening was shrouded in shadow, and she could barely make out the interior.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">A rumbling snort reverberated through the cave, and Eliza froze.  As her eyes began to adjust to the darkness, she could make out a shadowy form.  It shifted slightly and then something that sounded remarkably like a snore echoed off the stone walls of the cavern.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">As Eliza stood watching the sleeping troll, a question occurred to her.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">How was she going to administer the poison?</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">She honestly hadn’t thought that far ahead.  It wasn’t like she could pour the vial into the creature’s mouth – since she expected it would take some time for the poison to take effect.  She looked around the cave frantically, trying to find something to use.  Maybe it kept some food in the cave?  Her eyes swept over the bones – noticing for the first time how clean they looked.  It appeared that the troll had already eaten.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Despair crept into her mind, and she began to realize that days of work were going to amount to nothing.  She would still be stuck by this stupid bridge.  Even worse, she would have to continue to put up with the Hippie’s constant complaining.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">She closed her eyes for a moment, trying to calm her mind.  She just needed to think this through.  How did people administer poisons?  Honestly, who knew?  Believe it or not, assassination techniques hadn’t been part of her regular curriculum.  But that thought made her pause.  She had actually studied a few organisms that effectively poisoned their hosts.  For example, viruses weren’t poisonous per se, but she knew that they had many vectors for transmission.  Touch, bodily fluids, vapor…</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Now that was an idea.  She had her </span><span class="calibre21">Obscuring Mist</span><span class="calibre6"> spell.  Maybe she could somehow combine the poison with the spell.  But how?  She visualized the steps of the spell.  First, it gathered moisture to her, forming a globe of water.  As she finished casting, the orb exploded into a mist.  Maybe she could apply the poison to the orb before she finished casting?</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Yet that only created another problem.  She needed her hands free to keep casting.  How would she administer the poison?  Perhaps she could pause casting the spell by not completing the incantation?</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre21">Damn it.  I wish I had tested this before coming down here</span><span class="calibre6">.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">She would probably only get one chance to test her theory before the troll killed her.  Then she would have to wait for her respawn, walk all the way back, and hope that the troll was still asleep.  That was also putting aside the fact that she only had the one vial of poison.  It would take her days to make another vial.  Of course, all of this assumed the poison would even work.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre21">Just do it</span><span class="calibre6">, she told herself.  </span><span class="calibre21">You can’t change any of that now, and you have nothing to lose by trying.  Except dying gruesomely…</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Taking a deep breath, Eliza pulled the glowing green vial from her pack, setting it gently on the ground in front of her.  The troll stirred at the sound of the glass clinking against a pebble and Eliza froze.  When it made no other movement, she let out a short breath.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza began to move her hands through the familiar sequence of the spell as arcane words spilled from her lips in a whisper.  The globe of water slowly began to form in front of her.  As she neared the end of the incantation, she abruptly stopped speaking.  The globe continued to hover in the air, its surface rippling rhythmically.  Silently thanking the Great Black Sheep in her head – although she would never admit that to the Hippie – Eliza grabbed the vial and unstopped it.  Then she poured the contents onto the orb.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The water swiftly turned a ghastly, glowing green.  Moving her hands back into position, she said the final word of the incantation.  Just like in Alma’s garden, the orb exploded into a thick mist that swept into the cave.  Except this mist glowed a sickly emerald and seemed to throb gently as it enveloped the sleeping troll.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza watched in anticipation, her pulse pounding in her veins.  Would it work?</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The troll let out a snort and inhaled deeply, causing an eddy of mist to pour into its nostrils and mouth.  At the same time, a wave of moisture began to pour out of the cave toward Eliza.  Her eyes went wide, and she darted to the side to avoid the deadly substance, putting the hem of her sleeve over her mouth.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The snorts inside the cave soon changed to a heaving cough.  The ground trembled as the troll began to move, crashing into the stone wall of the cave awkwardly.  It lumbered out of the cavern and Eliza tried to keep as still as possible; she didn’t want to draw its attention.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The creature collapsed at the edge of the river, falling to its knees.  It gave a series of great heaving coughs and then vomited into the river, pieces of bone and partially-digested flesh visible amid the bile.  Eliza looked away, squeezing her eyes shut.  Then she heard another crash and turned to find that the troll had fallen on its side.  Its glowing green eyes caught sight of her, and it lifted a hand weakly in her direction while its chest heaved feebly</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza felt a bit conflicted as she watched the creature.  Over the days spent gathering plants, she had frequently visualized killing the troll and finally getting her revenge.  However, now that she saw the monster’s pain-filled eyes and watched it struggle vainly to rise, she felt… guilty.  Nothing deserved to die like this.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Taking pity on the monster, Eliza began casting an </span><span class="calibre21">Ice Bolt</span><span class="calibre6">.  A shard of ice formed in the air in front of her as her fingers wound their way through the requisite gestures.  The shard thickened quickly and then lunged forward – embedding itself in the Mountain Troll’s eye.  The creature thrashed for a second, its body spasming uncontrollably.  And then it lay still.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Finally, a long-awaited notification flashed in the corner of Eliza’s vision.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre7"> <span class="calibre6"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre46">The Mountain Troll has died.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre7"> <span class="calibre6"> </span> </p>

   <p class="calibre7"> <span class="calibre6"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza heaved a sigh of relief, leaning against the edge of the cliff.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">As the green mist cleared, she remembered why she was here.  She needed to complete the Hippie’s quest.  She edged into the cavern, pulling the materials for a makeshift torch from her back and lighting the wooden wand.  The torchlight soon illuminated the cavern, revealing piles of junk littering the back wall.  Weapons, armor, and assorted knick-knacks filled the cavern, glimmering faintly in the light cast by the torch.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza approached the piles cautiously, her brow furrowing.  Most players would probably be ecstatic at finding so much loot.  However, Eliza didn’t really have any way to carry all of this stuff.  Besides, how on earth was she going to find the quest item amid all of this junk?  She didn’t even know what she was looking for.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“I found it!” a voice cried out and the Hippie’s head popped up from one of the piles.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza yelped in surprise and jumped back.  “What the hell is wrong with you?” she yelled at the god, her patience finally cracking.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">He glanced at her in confusion and then looked down at himself.  “What do you mean?  I’m a vision of health.  Not like our troll friend out there.”  Then he looked back at his hand as though seeing the item for the first time.  “Besides, I found the item of supreme power!  You should be excited!”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The Hippie shuffled out of the pile of junk, with Fluffy following closely behind him.  The sheep yawned tiredly and watch the scene with a bored expression as the god walked over to Eliza and shoved the item in her face.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“It-it’s a brush?” Eliza asked.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Not just any brush,” the young man admonished her.  “It’s Fluffy’s brush!  See?”  He walked over to the black sheep and proceeded to begin brushing his thick coat.  Fluffy’s eyes rolled back in bliss as he leaned into the Hippie.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza just stared for a long moment.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“I…” she began.  Then she stopped.  There was no point.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Without any further ado, Eliza turned and marched out of the cave.  She was going to return to her garden.  If she ever saw the idiot god again, it would be too soon.</span> </p>
