   <p class="calibre7"> <span class="calibre6"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“How did it go?” Alma asked.  The older woman was waiting at the front steps of her cottage when Eliza arrived back at the compound.  The sun still shone high overhead, and Eliza could hear birds chirping in the trees ringing the small group of buildings and the buzz of insects flitting through the nearby garden.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Good, I think,” Eliza said, mustering a nervous smile.  “Evan said he would have the first prototypes finished in a couple days.  He seemed rather </span><span class="calibre21">enthusiastic</span><span class="calibre6">,”</span><span class="calibre21"> </span><span class="calibre6">she offered tactfully.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Alma barked out a laugh.  “You mean he had that crazed look in his eye and probably started working on the weapons before you had even left his shop.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Well, yes actually,” Eliza replied.  “He seemed relieved to be tackling a project that didn’t involve another clock, but in kind of a scary way…”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Alma nodded along with that explanation.  “Well, now we need to focus on your next problem,” the older woman said, her expression sobering.  “Specifically, we need to develop a few poisons that you can use in conjunction with your new weapons.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza’s eyes widened at the alchemist’s nonchalant explanation.  Alma discussed the idea of brewing poisons the same way she asked Eliza to pull weeds or water the plants.  “Umm, do you have some books that I could read or…” she began tentatively.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Alma’s mouth split into a sly grin, and she spared a wink at the girl.  “I can do you one better.  Come along, I have something I want to show you.”  As she finished speaking, the older woman began hobbling toward the back of the garden, her cane making a rhythmic thump in the dirt as she moved.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza had no choice but to follow.  Although, she was confused as to where they were heading.  Up ahead was a simple tool shed that had been erected near the back of the garden.  Beside it stood a massive overgrown hedge that partially ringed the compound.  Eliza had only been back there a handful of times – usually to retrieve a tool when working the garden.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Ahh, here we are,” Alma said a moment later, gesturing at the shack.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“The tool shed?” Eliza asked cautiously, glancing at the alchemist and beginning to wonder if she was slipping in her old age.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Alma’s lips curled into a mischievous grin.  “Not the shed, girl.  The shrub beside it.  Just watch,” she explained.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Alma’s eyes flashed a brilliant sapphire, and her hands began dancing through an intricate series of gestures.  Before Eliza could question what was happening, the surface of the overgrown hedge rippled and contorted – the colors swirling together and then breaking apart like eddies of water.  A moment later, the hedge had vanished entirely, revealing a cabin abutting the tree line – this one much larger than the other structures that made up Alma’s compound.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“W-what was that?” Eliza asked in shock, eyeing the older woman.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“A simple illusion spell,” Alma explained calmly, stepping toward the cabin.  “There are many applications of water magic.  While you have decided to utilize some of its more offensive abilities – there are other utility spells that can have interesting uses.  This particular spell wouldn’t prevent someone from stumbling into the structure by accident, but it would deter any curious passerbys.  More powerful illusion magic can actually simulate touch, taste, and smell as well.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The older woman glanced over her shoulder with a smile.  “I have found illusions to be extremely… </span><span class="calibre21">useful</span><span class="calibre6"> in my occupation.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“As an alchemist?” Eliza asked in confusion.  Why would someone who brewed potions for a living need to use illusion magic?</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Ahh, not quite,” Alma replied, an excited smile curling her lips.  “I wasn’t sure whether to show you this, but you’ve proven yourself to be far more competent and inventive than my previous apprentice.  So, I think we can make an exception.”  With that, the older woman pushed open the door to the cabin.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Inside was an alchemist’s paradise.  This wasn’t a quaint cottage – it was a full-fledged laboratory.  Stills and burners lined the walls, and glass tubing spiraled through the air in intricate patterns.  Along one wall was a series of shelves holding all manner of multi-colored powders and pre-prepared herbs.  The facility even had its own furnace.  At the back of the lab was a large sheet that looked like it had been draped over a pile of boxes.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“To answer your original question, I think a more accurate title for my profession would be ‘Royal Poisoner’ – at least once upon a time,” the older woman continued, gesturing around the room.  “Nowadays, I still make a fine living selling these poisons up and down the Silver Coast to certain </span><span class="calibre21">discerning</span><span class="calibre6"> customers.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Wait, what?” Eliza asked, her mind wheeling as she looked at Alma in a new light.  “But what about the potions you sell in town?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Alma turned her gaze back to Eliza, noting the shock on her face.  “Did you think I could afford this entire compound and the rare plants growing in my garden by brewing a few healing potions for the local townsfolk?  Cures for the common cold?  The occasional </span><span class="calibre21">love potion</span><span class="calibre6">?  That’s simply a front to deflect suspicion – my real business is selling poisons.  Although, traveling into town to set up my stall is becoming such a pain as I get older…”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">As she saw Eliza staring at her blankly, her mind still trying to process this new information, Alma continued, “But this is neither here nor there.”  She shuffled across the laboratory and reviewed a row of vials along one wall – each one labeled with a small scroll of paper.  “What we need to focus on right now is what type of poison would work best with your new weapons.  You may also need to develop something unique to help hunt the stag.  You will need to experiment, of course.  We can’t be certain what resistances other travelers or animals might have.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“H-how should I experiment exactly?” Eliza asked, recalling her encounter with the players with a grimace.  She didn’t relish the idea of dying over and over again until she figured out the most effective combination of poisons.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Alma smiled at her nervous expression, anticipating her concern.  “There’s no need to engage in combat to test out your latest concoctions.  As I said, I am not one for direct conflict myself.  That’s why we have these little beasties…”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">As she finished speaking, Alma tugged at a tarp resting near the back of the laboratory, revealing neat rows of cages lining most of the wall.  Inside were what appeared to be normal rabbits, their fur a motley collection of whites, browns, and grays.  They shuffled hesitantly in their cages, eyeing Alma and Eliza with placid expressions.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“The rabbits around town are typically considered level 1 creatures,” Alma explained.  “The travelers rarely spare them any attention – likely because they provide little experience.  However, as test subjects, they’re excellent.  They breed quickly and don’t have any natural resistance to toxins.  So, you can determine a poison’s full effect.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Doesn’t that seem… cruel?” Eliza asked, staring at the rabbits.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Alma nodded in understanding.  “Perhaps?  But all animals fight for their survival – including humans.  A sadist kills for sick enjoyment.  We do this because we need to in order to survive and flourish.  How is that different from a dragon that eats its prey… or a bear that attacks a player to defend its territory?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The older woman met Eliza’s gaze evenly.  “Or players that would kill you out of greed?”  Alma’s eyes clouded over, and her gaze drifted to a corner of the room.  “Sometimes we must make hard decisions to move forward and to protect ourselves – and sometimes those decisions require some collateral damage.  In this case, you should be happy that only a few rabbits will need to die.  You may have to face decisions in the future with far more dire consequences.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Alma drifted into silence, clearly lost in her own thoughts.  Eliza could only wonder what had happened in the woman’s past to warrant such a sorrowful expression.  Although, with the hints she had dropped regarding her background, Eliza suspected that Alma likely had many regrets.  A person didn’t specialize in brewing poisons unless they intended to kill with them.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“So where should we get started?” Eliza asked, trying to dispel the heavy silence that now hung over the room.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Alma shook herself and glanced at Eliza.  “Do you still have any of the ingredients that you used against the troll?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza nodded quickly and moved to an empty table in the center of the room, dumping the contents of her pack on the clear surface.  There was an assortment of Caracas Leaf seeds, Mentril Root, and Caper Bark.  Alma inspected the ingredients carefully, murmuring to herself.  “Good, good.  This is a fantastic start – you retained the information in those other textbooks well.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Alma turned to Eliza.  “I would start with the seeds from the Caracas Leaf.  As you are no doubt aware, the leaves are innocuous – causing only mild itching.  However, the seeds are special.  Properly distilled, they can create a fine oil with paralytic properties.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“How long would it last?” Eliza asked, her thoughts racing as she considered the possible applications of a paralyzing poison.  That would have been incredibly useful with the bear.  If she had been able to freeze the creature in place, she could have taken him out with a few well-placed </span><span class="calibre21">Ice Bolts</span><span class="calibre6">.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“It depends on the concentration and quantity, but it is typically only a few minutes at most – less depending on the creature’s size, metabolism, and the method of transference.”  Alma smiled slightly.  “As I said, illusions are helpful for this.  You can typically have a creature ingest the poison directly – although your mist method may be more effective in a direct conflict.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“What about the Mentril Root and Caper Bark?” Eliza asked, nodding along with Alma’s explanation.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“The root typically creates a wasting sickness.  In large enough doses, it can cause death.  The bark is often used to create a mild insecticide – which is useful for farmers but less helpful in our present situation.  Some poisons and ingredients are only effective against certain types of animals and creatures.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre21">So, it’s similar to our world</span><span class="calibre6">, Eliza thought, recalling the many biology and chemistry textbooks that her parents had forced her study.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Of course, there are also many combinations of ingredients that can create new, more poisonous variants,” Alma continued.  “You can also include animal parts such as blood, bone, flesh, and organs into the concoction to add additional effects – although those materials are much more difficult to come by.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Alma turned to Eliza, an excited gleam in her eye.  “There are alchemists that spend their entire lives studying poisons and recording the different combinations and effects.  The possibilities are nearly endless – as you no doubt witnessed firsthand with the poison you brewed to slay the troll.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Alma’s enthusiasm was infectious, and Eliza couldn’t help but feel her heart race as she glanced around the lab with fresh eyes – noting the dozens of vials that lined the shelves along the wall.  She was beginning to realize that she had just barely scratched the surface of her </span><span class="calibre21">Alchemy</span><span class="calibre6"> and </span><span class="calibre21">Poison</span><span class="calibre6"> skills, with Alma essentially only covering the basics.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Her real-world studies had always felt dry and dull.  She was just memorizing the work done by others – with little room on the horizon for invention.  What was the fun of being an explorer when almost everything had already been mapped out by a dozen generations of scientists and any new invention required access to a full-fledged pharmaceutical laboratory?  Yet here she could invent something entirely new.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The thought was intriguing, and Eliza was already itching to get started, her eyes glancing at the herbs lying on the table in the center of the room.  The possibilities were limitless.  She just couldn’t decide what she wanted to create first.</span> </p>
