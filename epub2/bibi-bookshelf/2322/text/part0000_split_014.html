   <p class="calibre7"> <span class="calibre6"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza had been wandering the forest for hours now, to the point where the entire journey had begun to blur together into an endless series of tree trunks and leafy branches.  If it weren’t for her map, she was pretty sure she would have gotten lost many times over.  At that thought, she slumped against a tree and let out an exasperated sigh.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Not only had she wasted an incredible amount of time, she hadn’t once caught sight of anything that even remotely resembled a deer, let alone a silver one.  She had passed several groups of players, being cautious not to draw too much attention to herself.  And, luckily, she had avoided any more encounters with the local wildlife – having become accustomed to scouting ahead and keeping a </span><span class="calibre21">Dexterity</span><span class="calibre6"> potion in hand in case she needed to run.  She had learned her lesson with the bear.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“I leave for a few minutes, and you’re already lazing about,” the Hippie abruptly spoke up, appearing from behind a nearby tree with Fluffy in tow.  “For shame!”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Minutes?” Eliza grumbled.  Of course, the Hippie would show up now to taunt her for her failure.  “Try hours.  And I haven’t seen this silly deer once.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Oh, really?” the god replied in surprise, his eyes wide.  “I thought this would be an easy quest – a slow pitch, if you know what I mean.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza closed her eyes, rubbing at her temple with one hand.  “Easy?  This forest is huge, and I’m looking for a single creature.  Plus, there are a ton of players wandering around killing everything in sight.  You could at least narrow down my search a little.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Hmm, hardship builds character,” the god replied, leaning against the tree next to Eliza.  “Besides, giving away the location of the Silver Stag would be cheating.  I never took you for a cheater!”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Fluffy took this opportunity to trot up to Eliza and rub his head against her thigh.  The sheep looked up at her with an expression that almost looked like compassion.  Without thinking, she reached out and petted his head, watching as the sheep’s eyes promptly rolled back in bliss.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“This just seems impossible…,” she murmured.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Hmm, then perhaps you aren’t looking at it from the right angle,” the Hippie replied.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“What is that supposed to mean?” Eliza demanded, glancing over at him.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The god shrugged. “Well, every time that Fluffy and I put on one of our famous theatrical productions, we have to get in character.  You know, really try to put ourselves in our character’s shoes.  Maybe it would help for you to do the same here.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Wait, what?  You put on plays?” Eliza asked in confusion, glancing at the Hippie uncertainly.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Eternity can be a real drag let me tell you,” the god groused.  “We have to find things to occupy ourselves.”  At Eliza’s skeptical expression, the god continued defensively.  “Don’t look at me like that! Fluffy is becoming a rather experienced playwright.  He has several companies considering his manuscripts, and we’ve gotten some excellent feedback so far.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza risked a glance at the sheep beside her and noticed him shaking his head subtly.  Just how much of the conversation was Fluffy able to follow?  Not for the first time, she questioned whether the sheep was special somehow.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Anyway, this is all beside the point,” the Hippie said, waving a dismissive hand.  “What I’m saying is that you need to get in character.  You know, think like a deer.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Think like a deer?” Eliza echoed skeptically.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Yeah.  You know, deer things.  Erm… like eating grass?”  The god’s gaze shifted to Fluffy.  “That’s what deer eat right?” he whispered to the sheep – which earned him something that looked remarkably like a shrug.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Or maybe deer drink stuff?  Like beer… No, that doesn’t sound right.  Maybe water?  I guess?”  The Hippie now looked really confused, and he sighed heavily.  “I’m just now realizing that I know nothing about deer.  Fluffy is always much better at animal husbandry.  He actually wanted to be a veterinarian in his youth.  It seemed like such a good fit given his upbringing.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza just ignored the god’s ramblings.  Amid all of the random gibberish was the semblance of a good idea.  Maybe she had been approaching this all wrong.  Simply wandering through the forest didn’t seem like it would be successful.  She “might” run into the Silver Stag randomly, but it wasn’t a sure thing.  What if she changed tactics?  If she could identify an area that the deer would need to visit, then she could lie in wait.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The fragments of a plan were beginning to piece themselves together in her mind.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Hmm, that’s actually not a bad idea,” she murmured.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Oh, I’m so glad you like the idea for our new indie brewery,” the Hippie exclaimed.  “Fluffy has been skeptical, but I think Beastly Brews is a great name.  We were thinking of starting with some stouts and porters for our first batch…”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">As he noticed Eliza shaking her head, the god trailed off.  “What on earth are you talking about?” Eliza asked.  Apparently, she had tuned out his jabber for a few seconds, and he had gone off on an oddball tangent.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“What are </span><span class="calibre21">you</span><span class="calibre6"> talking about?” the god demanded.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Finishing your quest…  You know, finding the Silver Stag,” Eliza said slowly, once again questioning the god’s sanity.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Ahh, yes!  Looks like you have a lot of work to do and Fluffy and I should really get </span><span class="calibre21">hops-ing</span><span class="calibre6"> on that brewery idea.  I think I already have an idea for the logo…” the god trailed off as he walked behind the tree and abruptly disappeared.  Fluffy spared one last apologetic look at Eliza before following the Hippie.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza couldn’t help but sigh as she reviewed the conversation.  Could a god even drink beer?  Would alcohol affect him the same way as a human person?  That thought gave her pause.  Or maybe he was already drunk.  That would actually explain a lot.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">In any event, the crazy god had at least given her an idea of where to start.  She had passed a small stream further back along the hunting trail.  Perhaps the Hippie was right, and the Silver Stag did need to drink – just not beer.  This game seemed realistic enough for that to be a possibility.  If she walked along the stream or set up camp near a small pond, that might increase her odds of running into the animal.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">It certainly seemed like a better plan than roaming the forest aimlessly.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">With her mind made up, Eliza walked back down the path until she found the small stream.  The water was barely a trickle, running over the smooth stones of the creek bed and heading south.  A glance at her map confirmed that the town of Falcon’s Hook was due east – along with the shoreline – so maybe that meant that the stream would pool into a lake or pond further downstream.  It seemed possible, at least.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza made her way down the stream, the creek bed providing a much easier path forward that was unblocked by the dense vegetation of the forest.  She was being cautious and kept one of her potions in hand so that she could flee if she needed to.  If the stag was drawn to the source of water, then it followed that other animals and creatures would be drawn to it too.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Nearly an hour later, Eliza discovered that the stream terminated into a small lake.  The surface stretched about fifty feet across, reflecting the sunlight.  A quick inspection of the area revealed that several other small tributaries and streams fed into the lake.  A glance at her map also showed that she was now far to the southwest of Falcon’s Hook and was at least a few hours from Alma’s compound.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">She quickly scouted the area around the lake, noticing the impressions along the muddy edge of the shore.  Eliza saw an odd mixture of paw prints.  She had no idea what shape a deer’s hooves would make – or if the Silver Stag even really looked like a deer.  The Hippie wasn’t exactly a trustworthy source of information.  However, it did seem like the local animals used the lake as a source of fresh water.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Now what do I do?” Eliza murmured to herself.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">She supposed she should wait by the lake and see if the Silver Stag showed up.  That might be safer than wandering the forest.  With that thought, she took a seat against one of the trees a few yards from the shoreline.  She still had an unobstructed view of the water, but she hoped that this would conceal her small form.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">And so began the wait.  Various animals stopped by the lake over time.  She noticed a healthy bear population in the woods and some sort of creature that looked like a mutant boar – it’s body much larger than she expected and gruesome tusks jutting from its mouth.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Then there were the magical beasts.  Her blood froze in her veins when she caught sight of a massive birdlike creature, its beaked head affixed to a serpentine neck and bat-like wings jutting from its shoulders.  Her </span><span class="calibre21">Inspection</span><span class="calibre6"> revealed that the beast was called a Wyvern and it was a whopping level 150.  She had kept very still while it drank, practically holding her breath until it finally disappeared.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">After hours of sitting against the tree, Eliza almost missed the tell-tale signs of the silver-furred creature when it finally visited the lake – her eyelids drooping tiredly.  At first, she thought she had imagined the creature and blinked rapidly to make sure she wasn’t hallucinating.  Surprisingly, the Silver Stag did look a lot like a deer.  Yet it moved with a grace that seemed to defy physics, practically gliding up to the water.  An intricate framework of horns jutted from its head and gave off an ivory glow in the soft light of the forest.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza was careful to control her breathing, and she moved slowly as she climbed to her feet, afraid to disturb the beast.  She quickly inspected the Silver Stag, hoping that her ability wouldn’t reveal anything too crazy.  After her experience with the Hippie, she still suspected that there must be a catch to this quest.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre7"> <span class="calibre6"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre32"> <span class="calibre34">Silver Stag – Level ?</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre32"> <span class="calibre34">Health – Unknown</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre32"> <span class="calibre34">Mana – Unknown</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre32"> <span class="calibre34">Equipment – Unknown</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre32"> <span class="calibre34">Resistances – Unknown</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre32"> <span class="calibre34">Weakness – Unknown</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre7"> <span class="calibre34"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre21">Fantastic</span><span class="calibre6">, Eliza mentally grumbled.  The Silver Stag didn’t seem to have a level – or it was so much higher than her that she couldn’t determine its level.  Either way, that was bad news.  The inspection also hadn’t revealed any additional information regarding the creature.  So, she was flying blind.  Again.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Not having any other choice, she decided she may as well fire an </span><span class="calibre21">Ice Bolt</span><span class="calibre6"> at the creature.  She would probably die – horribly.  But she could always come back, and she needed more information if she was somehow going to slay the stag.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Just as her hands began to wind their way through the beginning gestures of the spell, a hail of missiles erupted from the far side of the lake, the black projectiles whistling through the air toward the Silver Stag.  The creature looked up lazily, and Eliza could feel her stomach lurch.  Then, with an almost bored expression, the deer seemed to teleport six feet to the side.  The missiles slammed against the ground where the deer had been standing a moment before.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza blinked a few times, trying to figure out what she had just seen even as another volley of projectiles raced through the air.  She could now see that there were players standing on the other side of the lake – at least five men and women robed in heavy leather with longbows drawn.  Their armor had been dyed a dark green, which explained why she hadn’t seen them until now.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Her gaze was fixed on the deer this time, watching carefully as the missiles approached.  In a blur of motion, the Silver Stag dodged to the side.  It didn’t seem to be casting a spell – it was just insanely fast.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">At the same time, another group of players emerged from the brush behind the deer, creating a semi-circle around the animal and trying to cut off its retreat.  The players wielded heavy spears, the iron tips glinting in the dull light that filtered through the trees.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The animal turned to look at the onrushing players skeptically.  It didn’t seem at all perturbed by its attackers or the new salvo of missiles that was racing through the air from the opposite end of the lake.  As the first spear was thrust toward the creature, it suddenly moved.  In a flash, it had gored a player’s throat with its horns, the glowing ivory surface now stained crimson as the animal stood beside the player impassively.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The other players looked on with wide eyes, a shout going up through their ranks as they turned to try to stab at the Silver Stag.  Yet the death of one of the attackers created a small opening, and the deer immediately took advantage.  It raced away in a flurry of movement so fast that Eliza had trouble following it.  Within only moments, the creature had completely disappeared.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“God damn it!” one of the players shouted, pulling Eliza’s attention back to the group of spearmen that still stood on the bank of the lake.  A man had emerged from the woods behind the group of players and waved at them wildly.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“You knew how fast the damn deer was.  I told you to thrust at the same time!”  The man roared.  He wore the same camouflaged leather armor as the rest of the group.  “But this idiot just had to go and try to claim the kill himself,” he spat, kicking at the player’s corpse.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza realized that she was still standing frozen next to her tree, her hands hovering in front of her – the spell now forgotten.  She couldn’t help but recall the advice she had received when she first entered the woods.  Not all players were friendly.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre21">Maybe I should get out of here</span><span class="calibre6">, she thought to herself.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Before she could leave her perch beside the tree, she felt something sharp press against her side. “Don’t move,” a gruff feminine voice spoke from behind her.  “One inch and you die.  Nod your head if you understand.”  Eliza slowly nodded her head, not daring to try to look behind her as her heart raced in her chest.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“We have another player back here,” the woman behind Eliza called.  The group near the shore glanced over, and the man – who Eliza assumed was their leader – waved a hand in their direction.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Move forward and keep your hands up,” the woman said, prodding Eliza with what she assumed was the tip of a sword.  Not knowing what else to do, she walked forward slowly, approaching the group of players along the shore.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Who is this?” the leader demanded, glaring at Eliza.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“I found her on the other side of the lake,” the woman behind Eliza explained.  “It looks like she had spread out some potions and ingredients around her.  I’m guessing she’s an alchemist.”  As the woman finished speaking, she circled around Eliza, finally coming into view.  Her kidnapper was wearing the same armor as her teammates, her dark hair bound behind her head in a tight ponytail and her eyes steely as she gazed at Eliza.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“I… I was just gathering ingredients,” Eliza stuttered, trying to give this group the same story she had used with the other players.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“A likely tale,” the leader groused, approaching her quickly.  “You are quite far from town, and you’re under-leveled for this area.  There are foraging grounds much closer to town that have ingredients for basic potions.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre21">Shit</span><span class="calibre6">, Eliza thought.  These players were clearly more competent and organized.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Which means,” the man drawled, “that you must be after the bounty on the Silver Stag.  Not that a solo player at your level would stand any chance of killing the creature.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Or she could just be a noob.  The alchemy tools seem to mesh with the story at least,” the woman said, eyeing Eliza appraisingly.  “What do you want to do with her?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The leader grimaced.  “Hmm.  Either way, she saw our camping spot and our attack strategy.  With the amount of money at stake here, we can’t afford to let her live.  Just kill her and take any potions she has on her body,” he said with a dismissive wave of his hand.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The woman immediately drew a small dagger and placed it to Eliza’s throat, the edge drawing a faint line of blood.  She couldn’t help but gulp as a heavy, dead weight settled in her stomach.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Wait,” the leader commanded before stepping closer.  A moment later, his face hovered only a foot away from Eliza.  “Do not come back here or tell anyone what you saw.  If you do, we will make it our sole task to hunt you down and kill you – repeatedly, until you’re only wearing rags and you don’t have a coin to your name.  Do you understand?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Y-yes,” Eliza managed to gasp.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Good,” the leader said and turned away.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Goodbye, little alchemist,” the woman said and then, in a swift movement, she drew the dagger across Eliza’s throat.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">A dull pain blossomed in Eliza neck, and her hands instinctively raised to her throat as she sank to the ground.  A pained gurgle escaped her lips as red notifications flashed in her peripheral vision.  As the world started to go black, she could see the woman rummaging through her pack, pulling out her hard-earned potions and pocketing them.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Then the world finally went dark.</span> </p>
