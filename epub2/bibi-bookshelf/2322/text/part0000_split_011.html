   <p class="calibre7"> <span class="calibre19"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza sat alone at the island in her kitchen, her hands nursing a cup of tea as she watched the screen that hovered above the nearby table.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Welcome to Vermillion Live, the only place to get the most up-to-date news and events regarding Awaken Online,” a man dressed in an immaculate suit announced.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“As most of you know by now, Lux has fallen to the Dark and has been transformed into the Twilight Throne.  We have confirmed that this was accomplished by a single player – the infamous Jason.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The man frowned slightly before continuing, “In addition, it appears that the residents have been transformed into the undead, and now players can roll new characters as zombies or skeletons.  Although it appears that many are reluctant to give this new race a try with the tenuous position of the Twilight Throne, with a mixed army of players and NPCs planning to march against the city.  And then there is the hefty time lock on re-rolling a character…”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“You also forgot to mention the fact that Jason is a psychopath,” the woman beside him spat.  “I expect you all have seen the gameplay footage at this point.  Alexion is right to be pulling together a group of players and NPCs to take out the Twilight Throne.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“It’s just a game, Beth,” the man replied with an arched eyebrow.  “Sure, Jason’s tactics are a bit unconventional, but you have to admit they’re effective.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Have you played this </span><span class="calibre21">game</span><span class="calibre6">?  It may not be entirely real, but it </span><span class="calibre21">feels</span><span class="calibre6"> real.  Honestly, at a certain point what’s the difference between killing someone in the real world or in-game?  Besides, I’m not talking about killing another player in cold blood.  I’m talking about these zombies.  Would you like to experience being ripped apart?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza felt a little conflicted as she listened to their banter.  She remembered feeling guilty for killing the troll.  Well, to be more accurate, she had felt guilty about causing such intense suffering – even if it wasn’t exactly real.  She hadn’t felt bad about </span><span class="calibre21">killing</span><span class="calibre6"> the troll.  He had smashed her to death after all.  He sort of had it coming.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“But let’s not take my word for it.  We have gameplay footage!” the woman continued.  “I expect many of you have seen this video from the night Jason conquered Lux.”  She waved at the screen behind her, which promptly flickered to life.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The camera view was from the perspective of a player.  It was nighttime, and the player was creeping toward what must have been the training grounds in Lux – a big open area dotted with straw dummies – or at least what was left of the training grounds.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The remains of bodies were scattered everywhere.  Moonlight reflected off the pools of blood drenching the stones and the sides of buildings, and entrails littered the ground.  Some of the corpses appeared to have either been ripped to shreds or blown apart.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The player moved toward a building in the center of the field, carefully picking his way through the dismembered corpses.  An unusual and foreboding silence hung over the training grounds.  The only sound that could be heard was the player’s ragged breathing.  As he approached the door to the building, the player gingerly opened the door and peeked through the crack.  Inside was a group of humanoid creatures, their bodies broken and bloody.  They stood still, staring mindlessly into the distance.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Oh shit!” the player gasped involuntarily.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The noise promptly alerted the zombies in the room.  A dozen milky white eyes were suddenly focused on the lone player.  Time seemed to freeze as the zombies all stood still, staring at the player.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Then, with a throaty roar, the group of zombies rushed forward in a frenzy of limbs.  In his panic, the player fell backward onto the ground, and the camera tilted erratically.  The player was trying desperately to crawl away from the building.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The view panned back to the small building.  The zombies slammed into the door and came pouring out, ripping the door off its hinges as they rushed at the player.  Their wretched screams tore through the air, and their faces were wild as their hands clawed toward the prone player.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Oh god no!” the player shouted.  His hands came into view as he vainly tried to defend himself.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Then the zombies were upon him, and his body was torn apart in a flurry of limbs, teeth, and blood.  Although the pain sensors in-game were heavily muted, the player let out an anguished scream as he was ripped apart.  Likely, the psychological horror of what was happening was worse than the dull pain he felt.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Then the screen went black.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza sat in shock for a moment.  Jason had done this?  She had seen the in-game notices and heard the whispers among the other students during her prep classes.  He was rumored to be able to summon the dead, but she hadn’t actually seen his creatures in action before.  She knew that she should be repelled by his actions.  Yet a part of her was… impressed?</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Suddenly, a door slammed on the other side of the house, and a moment later her mother walked into the kitchen.  “Hello, Eliza,” she greeted her.  Eliza didn’t miss the fact that her mother’s eyes had darted to the pile of unopened books on the kitchen table nor did she miss the disappointed frown that curled her lips.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Hello,” Eliza said softly, repressing the frustration that welled in her chest as her eyes dropped back to the table.  She only had a week left until her reprieve from studying was over.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Soon, she wouldn’t have any time to log back into AO.  This depressed her more than she cared to admit.  She would never tell this to the Hippie, but she had enjoyed inventing a new poison.  If she were honest with herself, she had also enjoyed defeating the troll.  Inside the game, she just felt… free.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza glanced back up at the screen, where one of the few still images of Jason flickered across the screen.  He appeared to be a slender young man, his face and clothes obscured by a dark billowing cloak.  He was a single person who had taken down an entire city by himself.  He wouldn’t let himself get backed into a corner.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Who is that?” her mother asked distastefully as the commentators continued their banter.  Eliza quickly lowered the volume – not wanting her mother to hear the details.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“He’s another player in that game you and dad got me,” Eliza said.  “He’s quite famous at the moment actually.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“For playing a </span><span class="calibre21">game</span><span class="calibre6">?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Yes, for playing a game,” Eliza replied softly.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">For some reason, her mother’s disapproving tone made her want to log back in even more.  She didn’t have much time left.  Her eyes turned back to the screen.  What would it be like if she acted without restraint like Jason?  What would happen if she just accepted the role the Hippie was trying to force upon her?</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">A part of her was curious to find out.</span> </p>
