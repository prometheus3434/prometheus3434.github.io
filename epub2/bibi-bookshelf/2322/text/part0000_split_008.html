   <p class="calibre7"> <span class="calibre6"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza’s fingers dug into the loose soil and wrapped around the base of the plant.  She pulled hard, ripping the weed out of the ground before tossing the offending plant onto the swiftly growing pile beside her.  She paused for a moment, rubbing at the sweat that had formed on her forehead as she surveyed the garden.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“You’re doing well, girl,” Alma called from behind her.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza turned and caught sight of the older woman standing in the doorway to her laboratory.  She wore thick woolen clothing stained with splotches of green and red – evidence that she had been hard at work creating another batch of potions.  The woman leaned heavily on her crooked wooden cane as her eyes scanned the garden appreciatively.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Thank you, Alma,” Eliza replied with a small, embarrassed smile.  “It’s the least I could do for you since you took me under your wing.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Nonsense,” the woman replied with a wave of her hand.  “You’re a fast learner.  Few of my other apprentices have picked up the trade as easily as you.  Speaking of which, why don’t you pick some Dragon’s Breath and come help me inside.  I promised to brew a batch of healing potions for Clarence’s men.  It seems they are unusually prone to injuring themselves.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza nodded agreeably.  Clarence ran the local lumber mill outside of Falcon’s Hook.  Unfortunately, injuries weren’t uncommon in that profession.  “Just give me a moment, and I’ll meet you inside,” Eliza replied.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Several more days had passed in-game, and Eliza had spent that time working in Alma’s garden and her laboratory.  She had been relentless in her pursuit of more knowledge, memorizing the plants in Alma’s books and insisting that the older women teach her as many potions as possible.  In contrast to her regular school work, she loved her new fantasy garden.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza gingerly stepped around a Thicker Thump plant, maintaining a distance of at least two feet.  She knew if she got too close to the bush, it would shoot small thorns in her direction – which would be covered in an irritant that would give her an itchy rash.  She had learned the hard way that there were some aspects of AO that were perhaps a bit too realistic.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">She had also discovered that many of the garden’s plants were rather violent – or extremely poisonous – so navigating the garden needed to be done with care.  After a moment’s trek through the various rows of plants, she found her target – a dark green plant with large, vibrant red bulbs.  Dragon’s Breath was an intimidating name, but it was actually one of the less dangerous plants she had encountered.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">She carefully plucked two of the red bulbs and deposited them in the pocket of her apron, quickly wiping off the crimson powder that clung to her fingers on the coarse cloth.  She could already feel her fingertips begin to tingle as the numbing effect of the powder took hold.  As she deposited the ingredients, a blue notification flashed in Eliza’s vision.</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre7"> <span class="calibre6"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza surveyed the notifications carefully.  She had leveled quite quickly over the last few days – although, admittedly, the time compression meant that nearly a week had already passed in-game since she had begun playing.  It had been a while since she had reviewed her Character Status and so she decided to check on her progress.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre7"> <span class="calibre6"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <img src="../images/00002.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre41"/> </p>

   <p class="calibre7"> <span class="calibre6"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">She had decided to put points in </span><span class="calibre21">Endurance</span><span class="calibre6"> and </span><span class="calibre21">Vitality</span><span class="calibre6"> to improve her ability to work in the garden, which made her tire slower.  The remaining points went to </span><span class="calibre21">Intelligence</span><span class="calibre6"> and </span><span class="calibre21">Willpower</span><span class="calibre6">, which improved her ability to cast simple spells and learn recipes.  However, working in the garden didn’t require much </span><span class="calibre21">Strength</span><span class="calibre6"> or </span><span class="calibre21">Dexterity</span><span class="calibre6">, so she hadn’t allocated any points to those stats.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza started back toward the cottage, picking her way carefully through the rows of vegetation.  As she neared the door, she hesitated and promptly slapped a palm to her forehead.  She had nearly forgotten to water the garden.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Turning back to the rows of plants behind her, her hands automatically began to dart through a series of practiced motions as arcane words slipped from her lips.  A ball of water slowly formed in front of her, condensing into a rough sphere about the size of a basketball.  As Eliza uttered the last word of the spell, the orb erupted into a thick cloud of mist, the fog drifting back over the garden and coating the plants with moisture.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza smiled slightly as she watched the spell work.  She had learned that </span><span class="calibre21">Obscuring Mist</span><span class="calibre6"> was intended to be a defensive spell for water mages, but she had found it incredibly useful for watering Alma’s garden.  After her encounter with the Hippie and his faithful black-haired companion, she had realized that the irritating young man had chosen her spells for her.  In addition to </span><span class="calibre21">Obscuring Mist</span><span class="calibre6">, she could also cast </span><span class="calibre21">Ice Bolt</span><span class="calibre6"> and </span><span class="calibre21">Cold Grasp</span><span class="calibre6">.  The first was a simple damage spell that shot a shard of ice.  The second was some type of slowing spell or something.  She hadn’t had any occasion to use those two spells yet, and she wasn’t sure how useful they would actually be in helping Alma.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Her chores accomplished, Eliza stepped into the house.  In contrast to the brightly-lit garden, the cottage was dim and, it took her eyes a moment to adjust.  The familiar rows of tables greeted her, and Alma had already placed the necessary equipment on one of the counters.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“You can go ahead and prep the Dragon’s Breath,” Alma advised, motioning to the table beside her.  “I’m setting up the distiller as we speak.”  Her wrinkled hands worked to connect a series of tubes to a flask set over a small burner.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza nodded wordlessly and deposited the red bulbs on the table.  She grabbed a mortar and pestle from one of the nearby shelves and swiftly set to work grinding up the bulbs into a fine paste.  They would then boil the mixture down and distill the oil.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The pair worked in sync as they made the potions.  One of the things that Eliza liked about Alma was that she didn’t demand constant conversation.  She also didn’t put any real pressure on Eliza to work – giving her free range to study her books and work in the garden as she pleased.  In contrast to her real life, this felt like a vacation.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Once the waiting vial had been filled with the distilled oil, Eliza poured the substance into several glass flasks filled with purified water.  She carefully stoppered the potions and shook them gently to mix the contents.  Soon she had a set of bright red potions sitting on the table before her.  She then placed the set of vials into a bag on the table.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Would you like to deliver them?” Alma asked, eyeing her carefully.  “It might do you some good to get out and see the city a bit.  You spend most of your time cooped up in the garden.”</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre7"> <span class="calibre6"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza shook her head at the quest prompt.  In the beginning, the text hadn’t been nearly so sarcastic and had outlined different quest rewards.  Now all she received were these passive aggressive messages implying that these simple quests were a waste of time.  The tone of the prompts also sounded suspiciously like the Hippie.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“I’d be happy to help,” she replied to Alma, grabbing the small bag.  She removed her apron and strapped the bag to the belt at her waist.  She also collected her pack containing a crude set of alchemy tools, some extra herbs, the potions she had created so far, and a few empty containers in case she stumbled upon some interesting plants on the way to Falcon’s Hook.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“I’ll be back in a bit.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Be careful, girl,” Alma called out behind her as she left.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre21">Be careful of what?</span><span class="calibre6"> Eliza thought dryly.  </span><span class="calibre21">There’s nothing between here and the city.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">She started her journey by following the rough trail through the thinning woods.  The Hippie hadn’t made an appearance since he had tried to drown her, but she kept an eye peeled anyway.  The trail soon connected to a full-fledged road where she joined other NPCs and players on their trek back to the city.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza eyed the other travelers as she walked, noting their dusty clothing and blood-stained armor.  They spoke animatedly – most traveling in groups of four or five people.  In contrast, Eliza walked alone and kept her head down, avoiding eye contact.  After a few minutes, she caught sight of the walls of the city ahead of her.  The massive piled layers of stone towered into the sky, forming a ring around the multi-tiered buildings inside.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Running yet another errand?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza whirled and discovered that the Hippie was walking beside her with Fluffy in tow.  The sheep scooted over beside Eliza, bumping against her and eyeing her with a woeful expression.  Taking pity on the sheep, Eliza petted his head absently, causing his eyes to roll back in bliss.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Yes, yes I am,” Eliza said shortly.  “Is that a problem?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Not really.  It’s just incredibly dull is all.  Do you happen to know how many times you have performed this particular quest?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“I haven’t been counting,” Eliza replied.  She had.  It was the eighth time she had run this type of errand.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Mmhmm,” the Hippie said in an unconvincing tone.  “Well, my chosen one needs to be doing more impressive feats,” he continued, throwing his arms wide.  “Grand sweeping battles.  Maybe tame a dragon.  Rescue a damsel… or…err, an eligible bachelor maybe?”  He hesitated.  “Although, it doesn’t look good that the guy went and got himself captured in the first place.  You really should save yourself for someone that can hold his own – you don’t need a </span><span class="calibre21">project</span><span class="calibre6"> at your age.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza grimaced at the Hippie’s unsolicited dating advice before glancing at the other NPCs and players that shuffled along within earshot.  She was surprised that they weren’t reacting to this strange conversation.  “I didn’t ask to be your </span><span class="calibre21">chosen one</span><span class="calibre6">,” she whispered quietly.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Of course not,” the young man replied in surprise.  “That isn’t the way this works. You’re my chosen one – not my </span><span class="calibre21">volunteered</span><span class="calibre6"> one.  At least, that’s how I think it works.”  He looked a little confused for a moment.  “The others told me that I was the one that did the choosing...”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“The others?” Eliza asked, pushing at her glasses with one finger and watching the Hippie with curiosity.  “What others?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“The other gods!” the Hippie replied, placing a hand on his chest.  “Just like me!”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“You’re a god?” Eliza inquired incredulously.  “You certainly don’t look like a god.  Or act like one.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The young man looked a little flustered and then pointed at his sheep.  “Just ask Fluffy.  He knows!”  The animal shook his head in what appeared to be exasperation.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Okay, sure.  You’re a god.  So why did you choose me?” Eliza asked, deciding to play along for the moment.  Maybe she could lose him in the crowd once they got to the city.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“I explained that already!  The other gods told me I had to.  Especially my prudish sister.  She was quite adamant about it.  Something about maintaining the balance.  Apparently, there was a little tiff, and a city was destroyed or something,” he added with a dismissive wave of his hand.  “I don’t have much interest in politics, you know.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“You mean Lux?” Eliza asked in surprise.  She might be a bit anti-social, but she had seen the in-game notification when Jason conquered the city – along with the rest of the game world.  The rumor was that he had apparently taken out an in-game city by himself.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The Hippie tapped his lips thoughtfully.  “That might be it.  Sounds familiar.”  He glanced at Eliza.  “You need to go do some amazing things like that!”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“No,” Eliza said.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“What do you mean, no?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“I mean that I’m happy with what I’m doing.  I like Alma, and I enjoy learning alchemy.”  She shrugged.  “I don’t want to conquer a city.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Well, I don’t want to either,” the Hippie replied in exasperation.  “But my siblings were quite insistent.  We all have to do things we don’t want to do,” he added with a frown.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Not me,” Eliza said.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The Hippie sighed.  “Oh, come on.  Just one epic quest?  Maybe a small one to start?  We can ease you into it.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“No,” Eliza replied.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“You haven’t even seen it yet!”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Don’t care.  I’m just going to deliver these potions and return to Alma’s cottage.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Here, at least read the prompt,” the Hippie said, waving his hands in the air animatedly.  Eliza looked at the people around them in alarm.  Could they not see or hear the Hippie?</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">A blue notification abruptly appeared in her vision:</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Are you kidding me?” Eliza asked.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Not at all,” the Hippie replied, looking a little miffed.  “Fluffy lost something important, and I need you to go find it.”  He glanced at the sheep and then back at Eliza.  “If you won’t do it for me, at least do it for his sake.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The Hippie nudged the black sheep and Eliza could have sworn the animal sighed before turning to look at her with a baleful expression.  She could see a lone tear hanging under one of its eyes as it let out a soft bleat.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“That’s low,” Eliza muttered, turning away.  “But the answer is still no.”  She could see that they were nearing the gates.  She quickened her pace slightly, ready to be done with this conversation.  Yet this didn’t help, as the Hippie easily kept pace.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Well, I didn’t want to have to do this, but you leave me no choice.”  The young man waved his arms again in a dramatic series of gestures.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">And nothing happened.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“I left you no choice but to wave your arms like a crazy person?”  Eliza asked, slowing and watching him in confusion.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">A raindrop landed on her face, and she wiped at her cheek.  She glanced up and noted that the sun still shone brightly and only a handful of clouds drifted through the sky.  And yet more rain continued to fall – quickly escalating in intensity.  Eliza immediately realized that the rain only fell in a straight line that ran across the road directly in front of her and extended into the distance on either side.  Within seconds, a torrent was falling from the sky, creating a veritable wall of water.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“What is…?” Eliza trailed off as she watched other players and NPCs walk through the barrier with no issue.  They didn’t even seem to notice it was there.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“It’s a </span><span class="calibre21">Water Fall Wall</span><span class="calibre6">,” the Hippie replied proudly, stumbling slightly as he said the words.  “Try to say that three times fast!”  Fluffy snorted softly beside him – whether in amusement or pain, Eliza wasn’t sure.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Why can’t they see this?” Eliza asked the Hippie, gesturing at the other players.  A few of them glanced at her with a confused expression but kept walking.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">He shrugged.  “I’m a god.  Travelers and other residents of this world can’t see me unless I choose to let them.  I could have sworn I mentioned that...”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Fine, whatever.  I’m just going to go through,” she replied, her frustration mounting.  She wouldn’t be forced into playing the capricious god’s games.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza plowed forward, approaching the wall of water.  As she neared it, the torrent strengthened until it was pounding against the stone and dirt of the roadway.  She tried to reach out an arm to touch the wall, but the water intensified further, and she was pushed back.  Apparently, the wall was intended to prevent only her from entering the city.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">She glanced back at the Hippie.  “This isn’t fair,” she muttered.  She noticed a few players and NPCs eyeing her askance as they walked through the water wall.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Life’s not fair,” the god said with another shrug.  “May as well accept it.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Then a smile crossed his face.  “Now about my quest…”</span> </p>
