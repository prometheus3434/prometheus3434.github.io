   <p class="calibre7"> <span class="calibre6"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza bit her lip, her mind wracked by indecision as she watched the players mill around the corpse of the Silver Stag.  Two of the men pulled their daggers and began the process of skinning the deer while the others stood guard nearby.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">There were at least twelve of them, and she couldn’t be certain that there weren’t more hiding deeper in the forest.  They were heavily armed, each member of the group robed in leather armor and carrying a spear.  She also hadn’t missed the longbows slung over their shoulders – indicating that they would be just as dangerous at a distance.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">She huddled against the tree, pulling her dark green cloak tighter around her to better conceal her presence.  Her </span><span class="calibre21">Ice Bolt</span><span class="calibre6"> spell was out.  At best, she could probably hit one or two before they took her down under a hail of arrows.  Her </span><span class="calibre21">Obscuring Mist</span><span class="calibre6"> and </span><span class="calibre21">Cold Grasp</span><span class="calibre6"> were also ineffective at this range.  She would need to be much, much closer to successfully use those spells.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre21">Maybe I can just wait them out</span><span class="calibre6">.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">If she gave them time to finish up with the deer and head back to Falcon’s Hook, she might be able to follow them through the woods and ambush them with her traps.  Yet she immediately discarded that thought.  She hadn’t even seen the players until they dropped from </span><span class="calibre21">Sneak</span><span class="calibre6">.  They were clearly stealthier than she was – which she had to admit wasn’t saying much.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre21">What does that leave me?</span><span class="calibre6">  She thought frantically, her stomach clenching as she saw how quickly the men were preparing the deer.  If she didn’t move soon, then she was going to lose her opportunity.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Her racing thoughts centered on the memory of her first encounter with the players.  They had been dismissive of her – a young alchemist out in the woods by herself.  They had challenged her story that she was just in the forest looking for ingredients and had only stumbled upon the stag by chance.  However, she remembered that the leader and his crew had wavered.  Realistically, what chance did an alchemist have of slaying the Silver Stag?</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">They had killed her primarily because they didn’t want witnesses or anyone following them, but what if they had needed her for something?</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">That thought gave her pause, the germ of an idea beginning to take shape in Eliza’s mind.  It was crazy, and she would almost certainly die.  Yet, even as her worries started to resurface, she forcefully tamped down on them.  This was a game, after all.  What was the point of playing if she never took a risk?  Was she going to back down now just because she was scared?</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza took a deep breath and then forced herself to take the first tentative step away from the tree, her thoughts focused on the story that she would need to tell the players.  She was going to need to be very careful about how she played this.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">She let her cloak part, revealing her brightly-stained tunic as she stooped to pick a nearby plant, handling the thorny stem gingerly.  It was useless for her poisons, but the players wouldn’t know that.  At the same time, she began humming to herself, trying her best to go for a carefree tune.  The sound that came out of her mouth sounded more like a baby bird dying than a happy whistle, but it was the best she could do under the circumstances.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">As she kept up this act, Eliza made her way forward slowly, picking plants and trying her best to appear blissfully unaware of the heavily-armed players lingering at the edge of the lake – who would more than likely kill her.  Needless to say, she was having some trouble keeping up appearances.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Halt,” a harsh voice barked a moment later.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza looked up with wide eyes at the player who now stood nearby, an arrow leveled at her forehead and the bowstring taut.  Her hand was frozen midway to another plant.  “W-what’s wrong?” she squeaked.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Shut up.  I’ll be asking the questions,” he snapped, his eyes stony.  “Put your hands up and come this way quickly.  No sudden movements.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre21">Okay, this was a really stupid plan</span><span class="calibre6">, Eliza thought morosely.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">However, it was too late to back out now.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">She followed the man’s instructions as he guided her to the shore of the lake.  The group of players looked up as they approached, their expressions hostile and their hands lingering on their weapons.  They certainly wouldn’t just let her go, but she had known that already.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“My, my.  Our little alchemist returns!” the leader said, approaching slowly with a smirk curling his lips.  “I suppose you didn’t learn your lesson the first time.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“I found her picking plants in the forest,” Eliza’s guard reported.  “She didn’t seem to know we were here.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The leader glared at the guard before glancing at the stag’s corpse.  “Well, she certainly does now!  Why didn’t you kill her in the forest?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“I-I thought she might have other teammates nearby,” the guard muttered.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The leader sighed in exasperation before turning to Eliza.  “It’s so difficult to find good help these days.  As I’m sure you’ve noticed by now, we finally managed to slay the Silver Stag.”  A proud little smile lingered on his lips.  “It was quite the experience, between the so-called Ice Witch that’s haunting this forest and the million traps between here and town.  But the Witch finally slipped up!  In fact, we have her to thank for helping us complete the bounty.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Turning back to Eliza, the man’s eyes went cold.  “Now the question is what to do with you,” the man drawled.  “I would have thought us killing you and looting your corpse would have driven the point home.  You should not have returned to this lake.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“I-I was just trying to collect some ingredients.  This area had been dangerous with the Witch’s traps, but it’s also the only place where Ferrytail Grass grows naturally,” Eliza said quietly, keeping her eyes on the ground and doing her best to look timid.  It wasn’t that difficult considering that there was a strong possibility she was about to die.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The leader’s forehead pinched as he inspected Eliza carefully, suspicion creeping across his face.  “Hmph.  You’re right that this place has become a death trap of late.  Speaking of which, how </span><span class="calibre21">exactly</span><span class="calibre6"> did you manage to get through all of the traps?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre21">I’ve got him now</span><span class="calibre6">, Eliza thought, trying her best to keep a triumphant smile from drifting across her face.  She just needed to keep up her act and pray that the players weren’t that familiar with the in-game magic system.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Ahh… I…,” she began, looking uncertain.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The player’s eyes flashed angrily, suspicion clouding his features.  He slowly drew a dagger from the sheath at his waist as he stalked toward her.  “I suggest you think carefully about how you reply.  I’ll only ask one more time.  How did you avoid the traps?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“T-they are water-based.  I read that on the forums,” Eliza squeaked as she eyed the metal blade with wide, fearful eyes.  She still remembered the sensation of a similar dagger running across her vulnerable throat.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“And how does that help?” the player demanded in frustration, although he withdrew slightly to let her speak.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“I-I can cast </span><span class="calibre21">Obscuring Mist</span><span class="calibre6">, and it r-reveals the outline of the traps,” Eliza murmured.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">This was pure, unadulterated bullshit, of course, but she was banking on the players not knowing that.  None of them appeared to be mages and general knowledge about the game mechanics was pretty scarce at the moment – as her recent visits to the online forums had quickly revealed.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Oh, really?” the leader said, his eyebrows rising in surprise.  He spared a glance at his groupmates and saw that they were paying much closer attention to the conversation now.  Several murmured to each other quietly, gesturing toward Eliza.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">She felt another flash of triumph.  </span><span class="calibre21">Yes, you need to make it back to town with the pelt in order to retrieve your reward, don’t you?</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">However, suspicion still lingered in the leader’s eyes as he turned his gaze back to Eliza.  “Well, if that’s the case, then I’m sure you wouldn’t mind giving us a little demonstration?  There are likely more traps nearby.  We’ve only tested about a ten-foot circle around the corpse,” he explained, waving at the deer’s body.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Yes!  I could probably help you get back to town without any trouble,” Eliza said a little too quickly, playing her part.  She was happy to give them a reason not to kill her and send her on a one-way trip back to Alma’s cottage.  She also noticed the way the man smiled at her desperation, and she could feel her lingering fear begin to morph into anger.  These assholes had this coming.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“I’ll need to use my wand, though,” Eliza explained, gesturing toward one of the three metal rods strapped to her waist – each bearing a different colored band.  “I-is that okay?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Sure, we’ll just keep a few archers trained on you in case you try something funny,” the leader explained, waving a hand at his men.  Immediately, three arrows were nocked and pointed straight at Eliza.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">She gulped hard but slowly grabbed the wand at her waist with a yellow band, being careful not to make any fast moves that might entice the archers to fire.  Eliza then looked to the leader for permission before beginning her spell.  At his nod, moisture began to accumulate in the air in front of her – quickly forming a sphere of water.  Before the ball could completely take shape, she inserted her wand and discretely depressed the button on its side.  She didn’t want the bandits to know that she had changed the color of the orb.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The sphere continued to grow in size, glowing a brilliant yellow.  The leader looked at the sphere with an arched eyebrow.  “An odd color for water,” he commented dryly.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“I-it always does this,” Eliza assured him, trying for her best “pleading waif” look.  Apparently, it worked because the leader nodded and motioned for her to continue.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre21">Here it comes</span><span class="calibre6">, she thought as she felt the spell nearing completion.  She couldn’t help the small smile that tugged at her lips, and she would never forget the look of surprise on the leader’s face as he caught sight of her ghost of a grin.  He opened his mouth to shout a warning…</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">But it was too late.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The mist exploded outward in every direction, billowing and rolling across the muddy ground of the shore.  The fog left only a small pocket of clear air in the center of the maelstrom of moisture – just enough that Eliza wouldn’t be affected by her own poison.  As she finished casting, she immediately dropped to the ground, hearing the sound of missiles whistling through the air above her as the archers released.  The shouts of the player’s echoed through the fog – yet it was so dense that they couldn’t make each other out through the vapor.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Then the coughing began.  Eliza remained prone, waiting patiently until she heard twelve thumps – signaling that the players had dropped to the ground.  She ordered her mist to move away from the bodies but to maintain a close circle around the disabled group of players.  She couldn’t be certain that there weren’t more archers in the woods, and the mist would help obscure her from sight.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The leader’s body became visible only moments later, his eyes wide and staring straight ahead as he lay prone on the ground.  Eliza pushed herself to her feet and approached at a leisurely pace.  She had improved on her Paralytic Poison, and it now lasted nearly sixty seconds depending on the dosage.  Her mist also sat at the ready and could be recalled in order to administer a second dose if needed.  The second application reduced the effect of the poison – with a steeply diminishing return – but she didn’t expect that she would need much more time.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The man’s breathing was ragged and uneven and grew more rapid as Eliza stepped toward him.  Her eyes were a cold, glowing sapphire as she channeled her mana and she could feel the energy settling throughout her body.  As she neared the man, she stooped – looking him straight in the eye.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza’s thoughts drifted back to the videos of Jason’s attack on Lux and the creation of the Twilight Throne.  His performances were ruthless but effective, and there was a reason that the other players feared him.  She would need to accomplish something similar here.  Eliza needed to send a message that the players wouldn’t forget.  Especially since they had seen her face.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“I-I know… who… you…,” the player gasped, managing only a few words before the paralytic took hold completely and only a faint gurgle escaped his lips.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">She smiled at the man’s feeble twitches.  “Do you?  Do you really?  Did you know who I was when you had your men cut my throat?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Her voice was cold as she continued, “You deserve much worse than what I’m going to do to you.  Let me be clear, I now have a screenshot of your faces,” she said, raising her voice as she tapped at her system UI.  “If I see any of you in this forest again or any mention of me online, I will hunt </span><span class="calibre21">you</span><span class="calibre6"> down.  Forget about spawn camping.  What you need to be afraid of is </span><span class="calibre21">pain</span><span class="calibre6">, because this– </span><span class="calibre21">this</span><span class="calibre6"> is only just the tip of the iceberg.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">As she finished speaking, Eliza began casting an </span><span class="calibre21">Ice Bolt</span><span class="calibre6"> – the crystalline shard forming in the air and centering on the man’s face.  The icy spear inched forward, slowly closing in on one of his eyes.  The muscles in the man’s face twitched, and a desperate gurgle escaped his lips – as though he was trying to beg for his life.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">As she watched the man squirm, Eliza felt a pang of guilt.  She hesitated.  This was different than the troll or the bear.  This was a person staring up at her – not a computer program or a monster.  This was a real, </span><span class="calibre21">human</span><span class="calibre6"> person.  Could she really do this?</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Then the image of the man’s leering face flashed through her mind’s eye – his expression remorseless and amused as he ordered one of his group to slit her throat.  She remembered the way he had seemed to revel in her fear only moments before.  He would have done the same to her and maybe even worse.  More than that, she needed to protect herself and Alma.  She couldn’t afford to have this blowback on her or the people she cared about.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">As her mind spun chaotically and she grappled with what she was about to do, an odd sense of balance suddenly settled over Eliza’s mind, quieting the warring voices that bounced through her mind.  It was a strange feeling – intangible and difficult to pinpoint.  In the sudden calm, Alma’s words returned to her as she stood over the prone player.  This was just the way of this world.  This man wouldn’t have hesitated to kill Eliza.  She thought about the pain he had caused her and the pleasure he had taken in administering that pain.  How many others had he harmed?  With her body and mind awash in mana, she accepted this truth without hesitation.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">He deserved this.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">With that thought, she released her spell.  The ice shard rocketed forward, closing the small space between Eliza and the player almost instantly before embedding itself deeply in the man’s eye.  Blood bubbled around the wound, and his body spasmed, his nervous system still responding to the muted pain despite the paralytic coursing through his veins.  Another bolt in his other eye – still staring at her in horror – ended his life.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Then Eliza turned back to the remaining members of the group, their prone forms lying around her, encircled by the glowing, malignant golden mist.  Their wide, unblinking eyes were filled with a desperate terror, and their limbs twitched as they tried vainly to order their reluctant bodies to flee.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">As Eliza watched them with glowing sapphire eyes, she began to automatically summon another barrage of icy projectiles, the shards forming around her in a maelstrom of frigid vapor.  The same strange sensation washed over her once more – one she had trouble putting a name to.  It felt like she hovered upon a mental precipice between light and dark.  Her actions were neither right nor wrong.  They just </span><span class="calibre21">were</span><span class="calibre6">.  She reveled in the sense of peace that the feeling afforded her.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">In the real world, she might be too weak to confront her parents, and her classmates might dismiss her.  She might be uncertain about her future and afraid to reach out to her peers.  But here, in this place, she was the Ice Witch.  She was a force of nature.  And her judgment was absolute and final.</span> </p>
