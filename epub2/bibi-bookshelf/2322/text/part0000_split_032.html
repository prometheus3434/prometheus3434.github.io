   <p class="calibre7"> <span class="calibre6"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza shifted uncomfortably from her perch atop the wagon.  After she had agreed to brew the next batch of healing potions for Alma’s local customers, the alchemist had grudgingly allowed Eliza to borrow her wagon and mare.  It had taken Eliza some time to figure out how to guide the old horse – who she had lovingly named “Shithead.”  She wasn’t certain if the animal had a real name, but Eliza’s version fit perfectly.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Shithead seemed to take every opportunity to wander off the road to nibble on nearby grass.  Or, sometimes, she just wandered off for no explicable reason, and no amount of whipping the reins seemed to motivate the old mare to get back on track.  By the time the walls surrounding Tollhouse Farm came into view, Eliza was beginning to wonder if the Hippie had a horse-shaped doppelganger.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza now sat on the wagon, looking down at Tollhouse Farm in the valley below as the mare gorged itself on the tall grass that coated the hills.  The sight of the compound was sobering.  It forced her to face the reality of what she planned to do, and she spared a furtive glance at the bed of the wagon behind her, where barrels had been stacked in neat rows.  They were filled with a simple salve to help the sheep fight the infection.  It had been expensive to gather the materials necessary to make several barrels of the substance and Eliza was now nearly broke – once again.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">She wouldn’t need this much salve to treat the sheep, but she did need the wagon.  How else was she going to transport the massive bell to… well, wherever she was supposed to take it?  The Hippie – in typical fashion – had failed to explain where she was actually supposed to deliver the damned thing.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza patted the pouch at her side.  Lifting the flap gently, she ran her fingers along the jars and vials that had been carefully stored inside.  She had spent the rest of her funds and time brewing a number of enhancement potions, focusing primarily on </span><span class="calibre21">Dexterity</span><span class="calibre6"> and </span><span class="calibre21">Strength</span><span class="calibre6"> – with a few potions that increased </span><span class="calibre21">Vitality</span><span class="calibre6"> thrown in for good measure. Of course, she had also prepared a set of miniature jars holding small, virulent mold cultures.  It was difficult to believe that she was carrying a biological weapon in her worn pack.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">As her gaze returned to the compound, a small sigh escaped Eliza’s lips.  She could only hope her preparations had been sufficient.  Now that she was finally here, it felt like a swarm of butterflies had been released into her stomach.  Yet there was no sense second guessing herself now.  She just needed to push forward.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">A couple minutes and a lot of cursing later, Eliza arrived at the gates to the compound, and a familiar voice greeted her.  “Ho there, stranger!” There was a pause before she heard the voice continue.  “Wait, is that you Eliza?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza raised a hand to shield her eyes from the bright sunlight, finally able to make out a familiar face atop the wall.  “H-hi Brian,” she replied tentatively.  “I have Clarice’s ointment for the sheep.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Great.  Just give me a moment, and I’ll open the gate.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The entrance groaned as the wooden portal shifted open a few seconds later, and Brian’s smiling face appeared.  He was dressed in the same worn leathers, and he had a bow lazily slung over his shoulder.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“We were starting to worry that you weren’t coming back,” Brian said with a grin.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“It just took me a while to prepare the salve,” Eliza explained, her gaze dropping to the bed of the wagon.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Whew, no kidding.  You sure we need all of this?” Brian asked as he circled around the wagon to inspect her cargo.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Since we don’t know what’s causing the scratches, I figured Clarice would want some extra ointment.  The alternative was me having to make this trek every few days,” she said, having carefully rehearsed her story.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Well, that doesn’t sound so bad to me!  I could use the company.  I have to say it gets a bit lonely standing on a wall for hours at a time,” Brian replied, noting the way Eliza wouldn’t quite meet his gaze.  Without warning, he hopped up beside her and took the reins, his fingers brushing hers.  “Anyway, let’s get the wagon inside and meet up with Clarice.  I expect she’s going to want to put us to work.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza nodded numbly, trying not to think about how close Brian was sitting or about the fact that she was carrying a ton of mutant mold cultures that she planned to spread around the compound.  She just hoped that she could avoid hurting the residents.  Although, she expected that they would probably have plenty of time to flee.  If not, she could use her mist to knock them out and then use a strength potion to carry them out of harm’s way.  That was the plan anyway.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“You seem quiet today,” Brian commented as the wagon lurched slowly through the farm compound.  He seemed to have no problems directing the stubborn mare, and she could only assume the horse must have some vendetta against her.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“J-just lost in my thoughts,” Eliza muttered.  She ventured a glance at Brian, noticing the way he sat straight on the wagon’s perch and the easy way he guided the unruly horse.  “I take it you’re used to dealing with animals… working at a farm I mean.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Brian chuckled.  “I guess.  I’m pretty sure I’m just one notch above incompetent.  Clarice says I don’t have the knack for being a shepherd.  That’s why I get the </span><span class="calibre21">luxury</span><span class="calibre6"> of working the walls.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Really?  Because you don’t seem to have any trouble with shit- I mean, the mare.  I could barely keep her on track on the way here.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“This old girl?” Brian asked, twitching the reins slightly and eyeing the old mare with a smile.  “She seems like a sweetheart.  Or maybe she just senses that I needed a break from sentry duty and is taking pity on me!”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Speaking of which, did I get you in trouble last time?” Eliza asked, suddenly remembering that Brian had been missing when she left the farm.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">He grimaced slightly.  “I got reamed for leaving my post, but that isn’t exactly unusual.  Besides, you didn’t make me leave – that was on me.”  Brian sighed in frustration.  “Not that I understand what the big deal is.  Sure, there are some dangerous creatures living out here, but most don’t dare attack the compound.  My job is booooring.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza couldn’t help but smile at his tone.  That sounded pretty close to her feelings about school – an unavoidable and extremely painful nuisance.  “And you aren’t going to get in trouble for leaving again today?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Brian grinned at her.  “Actually, I had the foresight to give some notice this time.  Clarice has been expecting you for a day or two.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Ahh, well that’s good,” Eliza murmured.  As their conversation dwindled into an awkward silence, Brian turned his attention back to navigating through the farm to the northeastern edge of the compound.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza shook her head when she found herself glancing furtively at Brian out of the corner of her eye.  She needed to focus on her quest, not on… well, whatever this was.  She discretely pulled a series of small glass vials from her bag, popping the cork lids with her thumb and flicking the little containers at the bell tower as they passed.  It wasn’t important for her aim to be perfect, the vials just needed to land near a clump of grass.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">As she spread the mold cultures, Eliza said a silent prayer, hoping that someone – anyone – other than the Hippie was looking out for her.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">She had undertaken an extensive set of experiments last night, and she had discovered that the growth rate of the mutant mold was roughly exponential.  If she started with a small culture, it could take hours for the mold to reach what she was calling “critical mass” – that point where the mold had grown large enough to easily extend to other sources of organic matter.  She hoped that would give her enough time for the townsfolk to flee and for Eliza to figure out how to steal the bell.  Her best option was probably to chug a bunch of strength potions and somehow try to roll the monstrous metal object onto the wagon.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“And here we are,” Brian announced a moment later, tugging at the reins to bring the wagon up short.  He then hopped down and offered a hand to Eliza.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">She just stared at it dumbly for a long moment before accepting his help.  It felt weird holding his hand – especially when he kept meeting her gaze and smiling like that.  He was probably just being friendly, but she wasn’t really used to that.  It felt like she spent most of her time – in-game or out – trying to avoid being noticed.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“What is this?” Clarice barked, the severe woman stalking toward the pair from the pens.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Brian gestured at the wagon.  “Eliza came back with salve for the sheep.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“It looks like she must have brought some for every farm in the area,” Clarice groused, sparing a penetrating look at Eliza.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">When he saw Eliza fumbling to respond, Brian stepped in, “She figured you could store anything you didn’t use for later.  That would probably keep her from having to make multiple trips.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Clarice snorted in irritation, but she seemed to chew on the idea appreciatively.  “Fine, fine,” she said finally.  “There’s no sense standing around twiddling our thumbs then.”  She gestured to Brian.  “Unload the barrels and stack them near the lanolin beside the barn.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Then the woman turned on Eliza.  “While our young buck here is working on that, you can show me how well this salve works.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“S-sure,” Eliza replied, nodding quickly.  She grabbed a small vial of the mixture from the back of the wagon.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“See, you get to handle the animals while I get the joy of undergoing manual labor,” Brian whispered to her when she came close, his hands already tugging at one of the barrels.  “I’m pretty sure she just sees me as another farm animal.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza forced herself to stifle a laugh, but she managed a quick retort.  “Well, then you should be a good boy and get this unloaded faster.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Brian just stared at her in mock shock.  “My lady, was that… that a joke?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Maybe,” Eliza murmured, her eyes dropping to the ground and her cheeks suddenly feeling hot.  She was spared any further embarrassment when Clarice called for her impatiently.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza spent the next half hour showing Clarice how to apply the simple salve to the scratches on each sheep in the pen.  The substance had to be applied by hand – not ingested.  This was time-consuming, but there didn’t seem to be very many sheep inside the farm, and the pair finished the applications relatively quickly.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Her work complete, Eliza headed back to the wagon.  She had been assuming that the process of applying the salve would take longer – buying her some time for the mold cultures to grow.  However, the entire process had taken a little less than an hour, and her stomach was in knots as she tried to think of a compelling reason for her to linger at the farm a bit longer.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Hey, girl,” Clarice called from behind her as she approached the wagon.  “A moment?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza whirled and saw the surly woman beckoning for her to come closer.  Brian stood nearby, his chest heaving slightly and his armor looking a little dustier after manhandling the barrels over next to the barn.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Is there something else?” Eliza asked.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Actually,” Clarice said, glancing at Brian.  “Would you mind helping us administer the salve to the rest of the herd?  I’m not sure I trust this one to handle it on his own.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Brian looked at Clarice skeptically.  “I only saw the process from a distance, but I think I could manage.  There’s no magic to rubbing some lotion on a sheep’s belly.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“This coming from you?” Clarice demanded with a raised eyebrow.  “I heard James found you at the archery range with an arrow in your foot.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“T-that was a freak accident,” Brian interrupted quickly, glancing at Eliza nervously.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Uh huh,” Clarice grunted before turning back to Eliza.  “Anyway, would you mind going out into the fields to help administer the salve?  It should only take a few hours, and I can add a few coins on to whatever I already owe you.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza gulped.  Leaving the compound hadn’t been part of her plan.  She needed to stall, but she wasn’t sure how long the mold would actually take to grow.  If they took too long, things could get out of hand quickly.  Someone could get hurt!  On the other hand, what choice did she have?  She couldn’t blow her cover, and this would at least give her an excuse to come back to Clarice for payment.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“S-sure,” Eliza said, nodding quickly.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Then get to it,” Clarice said, gesturing at the wagon.  “I think you’ll only need one barrel if this small group was any indication.  I’ll let James know that you’re working for me today,” she added for Brian’s benefit.  With that, the gruff woman stormed off, presumably to order someone else around.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Sorry, she can be a little… intense,” Brian said to Eliza after Clarice had walked off.  He must have misinterpreted the nervous look on her face.  “Just let me grab a barrel, and we can be on our way.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza could only stare at his back as Brian walked off for the nearby barn.  This hadn’t been her plan at all.  She was beginning to suspect that the butterflies in her stomach must have laid eggs or mutated or… </span><span class="calibre21">something</span><span class="calibre6">, because she felt like she was going to be sick.  Her gaze shifted back to the bell tower that loomed over the farm.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">She could only hope that they could finish administering the salve quickly.</span> </p>
