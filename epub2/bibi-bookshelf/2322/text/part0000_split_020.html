<h1 class="calibre16" id="calibre_pb_73"> <a class="calibre17" id="_Toc519440626"><span class="calibre11">Chapter 17 - Anti-Social</span></a> </h1> 
   <p class="calibre7"> <span class="calibre6"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza was sitting in class, her fingers drumming against the surface of her desk, the sound making a staccato drumbeat against the fake wood.  Their teacher droned in the background, his face projected on a screen that hovered near the front of the classroom as a series of images were scrolled across the nearby margin – the graphics showing basic cellular reproductive cycles.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">She could see that her classmates were at least as bored as she was, a few sneaking peeks at their Cores under their desk or distractedly taking notes or doodling.  Eliza wasn’t sure she saw the point of typical high school classrooms in this day and age.  Most public schools lacked the resources to assign a teacher to each classroom, and so the staff remotely taught several classes at once – the teachers stationed at a central school building or working from home.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The result was a perpetual dumbing down of the material.  How could a single teacher answer questions for a few hundred students or reasonably convey that information?  This was exactly why her parents forced her into after-school preparatory classes.  Usually, the class sizes were much smaller, and the teachers had more training and experience.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza’s thoughts were interrupted as a faint chime sounded through the classroom, and the surface of her desk rippled and contorted, a quiz question projected across the table.  It looked like a simple question about mitosis, and her finger tapped the right answer automatically.  She hadn’t really been listening to the lecture, but biology was part of her extracurricular courses, and she had the elementary stuff down cold.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre21">I thought this was supposed to be a college-level class</span><span class="calibre6">, she thought tiredly.  She just needed to suffer through.  She only had a few more months until graduation.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Hmm, I can see that a number of you aren’t getting the material,” the instructor said, a frown plastered across his face as he reviewed the incoming quiz results.  Eliza looked up at the screen and saw that nearly 60% of the class had answered the question incorrectly.  She couldn’t help but glance at her classmates with an incredulous expression.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Class A23,” the instructor said, tapping at his console.  A small light on the camera at the front of the classroom flickered to life.  “Robert, could you please describe the five phases of mitosis for the class.  The camera focused on a student sitting beside Eliza, his face suddenly filling the screen.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Robert flushed under the sudden scrutiny, his face practically glowing as he realized he was being put on the spot in front of hundreds of other students.  “Umm.  Prophase, promeaphase… err… meta…”  he trailed off, looking confused.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Hmm, I can see that you didn’t do the reading last night,” the instructor said with a frown.  Eliza heard a small ding, and a “-10” appeared on Robert’s desk, indicating that the instructor had reduced his score for that class period – on top of the fact that he must have gotten the quiz question wrong.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Okay, let’s try this again,” the instructor continued, rubbing at his eyes tiredly.  The screen shifted, and now Eliza’s face was on the screen, blinking owlishly and adjusting her glasses self-consciously as she realized she was in the hot seat.  “Same question.  Name the five phases of mitosis.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza had no wish to have her face projected on screen any longer than it needed to be, and she murmured the answer quickly, her eyes focused on her desk.  “Prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Correct!  Good job,” the teacher said, before moving on to the lecture.  “Now let’s talk about common mutations that frequently appear during cellular reproduction.  This can result in something referred to as microevolution…”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza’s attention was focused on her desk, keeping her eyes down.  A small gold star appeared on the screen, signaling that she had earned some bonus credit for answering a question on the spot.  Yet she also didn’t miss the glare that Robert gave her or the muttering of the girls behind her.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre21">Great.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">She had answered the question to get out of the spotlight, only to irritate her classmates by showing them up.  Not for the first time, she wondered why her parents even made her go to class instead of handling her schoolwork from home.  She vaguely remembered them yammering on about the need for socialization – although Eliza had long ago resigned herself to the fact that she absolutely sucked at talking to other people.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">With a sigh, she went back to what she did best – keeping her head down and avoiding attention.  She made it through the rest of the day that way, occasionally snapping to attention to answer a quiz question, but mostly just letting her thoughts wander.  They naturally ended up on AO.  She was curious to see how well her traps were performing in-game, and she expected that Evan would be finished with her new weapons soon.  Maybe she could head into Falcon’s Hook when she got back in-game to check on the engineer’s progress before venturing back out to the forest to check on her traps.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">A bell interrupted her wandering thoughts once more, and Eliza glanced at the clock.  She just had PE and then she was done – she could go home until she had to repeat this tedious experience again tomorrow.  She grabbed her bag and headed for the door with the other students, quickly making her way to the other side of campus.  Dozens of other teenagers made a similar trek, although they spoke loudly and joked with each other.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza just kept her head down, changing uncomfortably into her gym clothes and then heading for the track field.  PE was one of the few classes that actually required in-person supervision – although she had heard that some schools now handled the process with drones.  As a result, their PE instructor was already in the field when her students arrived.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The woman barely acknowledged the teenagers as they approached, looking up from her Core for only a brief moment and waving a hand at the circular track.  “Today we’re going to run some laps… or just walk if that’s too painful for you.  You just need to make the circuit ten times,” she explained and then immediately turned her attention back to the small screen hovering above her wrist.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza sighed.  </span><span class="calibre21">Thank god for public education.  With this sort of enthusiasm, it’s no wonder that this school is performing so poorly in the city rankings.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">There was nothing she could do about it, however – except trudge around the circular track with the other students.  A few teens decided to be proactive and actually worked up the energy to run, but the vast majority simply broke up into smaller groups and chatted with their friends while they made their laps.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">As usual, Eliza trudged along by herself.  After the second lap, she began getting bored.  There was only so much pointless nonsense a person could take during the course of the day, and she was hitting her limit.  Actually, that was a lie.  She had passed her limit hours ago.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“I’m already level fifty,” one of the girls ahead of Eliza bragged to her friend.  “I went with earth magic and archery.  I can bind a target and then pick them off from a distance.  It makes farming pretty easy.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Not a bad strategy,” one of the guys beside her replied with a nod.  “I tried the fighter route for a while, but the melee combat in AO is a little… ridiculous?  Who wants to fight a dragon face to face?  I mean, it sounds cool on paper, but in reality, it’s insane.  I end up using my fire magic more than I swing my sword now.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“What?  Poor little Joshy can’t handle getting stabbed?” the first girl teased with a smile.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“You know I don’t swing that way, Rebecca,” he replied with a laugh.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Where are you guys playing now?” another guy asked.  “I’ve been staying close to Vaerwald since I’m a mage class, but the leveling is difficult.  There are just too many players around the mage city, and the fields are usually picked clean.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“The game started me along the eastern coast,” Josh explained.  “It took some time to get my old guildmates together, but we’ve set up shop near Falcon’s Hook.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza’s eyes widened slightly in surprise.  She hadn’t realized that some of her classmates were in the same area as her.  From what she had read online, Falcon’s Hook was a bit of a backwater compared to most of the in-game cities.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“How are the mobs in that area?” Rebecca asked.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Josh winced slightly.  “Not bad if you have a group.  We usually hunt wolf packs in the nearby forest.  You just have to keep an eye out for the bears.  It usually takes a couple of players to take one down.  I think the game treats them like some sort of elite creature.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Yeah, I notice that the difficulty spikes weirdly.  It doesn’t seem to be based entirely on the creature’s level,” Rebeca added.  “Like I can take out the imps around Vaerwald without any trouble, but then there’ll just be a golem out of nowhere that wrecks me.”  The rest of the group nodded in agreement.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza couldn’t help but frown as she listened to their conversation.  The bears were tough, but did they normally require a group of players?  That couldn’t be right.  Granted Eliza had only managed to take out the first one by climbing a tree and using potions.  The second one had also just sort of keeled over and let her wail on it with her </span><span class="calibre21">Ice Bolt</span><span class="calibre6">, but it seemed possible to solo one if you used some sort of crowd control ability first – like her poison.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“One of the guys in my guild claims he farms out in the forest solo, but I think he’s like level 60 already,” Josh continued, shaking his head.  “If it weren’t for the forced logouts, he probably would have starved to death already.  I’m not sure it’s really possible for the rest of us scrubs.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“I-I’ve killed a bear solo,” Eliza said, speaking up shyly from behind the group.  The other teenagers glanced back at her, incredulous expressions lingering on their faces.  “I’m actually in Falcon’s Hook too.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Josh snorted.  “No way.  What class?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Umm, water mage,” Eliza said quietly.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“That’s just BS then,” Rebecca said matter-of-factly.  “Even with higher-level ice spells, that would be a struggle and the cast times are ridiculous.  That’s why most water mages go healing or need a tank for support.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Josh shrugged.  “I dunno.  She might have managed to one shot it from a distance.  What level are you?” he asked, directing his question at Eliza.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Level 27, I think,” she said quietly.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Josh just stared at her for a long moment.  “Nevermind.  I’m going to have to go with Rebecca on this one.  That sounds impossible.  You’re barely higher than the lower-level bears near the edge of the forest.  Maybe another player had already injured it?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza bit her lip, not sure if she really wanted to explain that she had actually climbed a tree while running for her life.  Or that she had poisoned the second bear.  If they already didn’t believe her, then she expected that they might think she was crazy with that sort of explanation.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“See?  Look at her face.  I told you she was making it up,” Rebecca said, interpreting Eliza’s hesitation as a sign that she was lying.  “Why don’t we take a seat in the shade?  The teacher isn’t even watching us.”  The other students nodded, and they started walking toward the bleachers standing along the side of the field.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“I’m not…” Eliza began quietly, but the other students had already started walking away, and they didn’t hear her.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">A hollow weight settled in her stomach.  She shouldn’t be surprised that they didn’t believe her.  What was she thinking butting into their conversation?  After the scene in class earlier, she should have known better than to open her mouth.  It always seemed to end terribly.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Then she hesitated.  Was she really in the wrong here, though?  It wasn’t her fault that her classmates couldn’t solo the bears by themselves and she had now done it twice.  She had also figured out how to weaponize her </span><span class="calibre21">Obscuring Mist</span><span class="calibre6"> and brew poisons in-game.  Sure, she wasn’t as high a level as them, but she had come a long way!</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Her irritation only continued to grow as she made her slow laps around the track.  It was one thing for the other students to ignore or resent her – she was used to that.  But no one could refute her performance in the classroom, and she took pride in that.  That’s probably why Rebecca’s words stung so much, and why Eliza couldn’t help but glare at the group of other students as she passed them each time.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">She would show them.  Once she had her new weapons, she planned to take out the Silver Stag and complete the Hippie’s quest.  Then no one would be able to question her abilities in-game.</span> </p>
