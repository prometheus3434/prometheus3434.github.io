   <p class="calibre7"> <span class="calibre6"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza was hunched over a workbench in Alma’s secret lab.  Her brow was furrowed in concentration as she waited for the liquid simmering on the burner to reach the appropriate temperature.  In one hand, the young mage held a small disc covered in a gray fungus.  She was being extremely careful to avoid touching the substance.  She had quickly discovered that Carnivore Mold wasn’t something that should be toyed with lightly.  Even the smallest amounts would eat through skin and flesh at an alarming rate.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">To make matters worse, the mold had a minor paralytic effect.  In the wild, it deadened the nerves of its target – acting similar to a local anesthetic.  Eliza expected that the mold would be incredibly dangerous if a creature weren’t aware that it had touched the substance.  The mold would likely eat away at the animal’s flesh before it even realized that it was in danger.  She had no idea how Alma had managed to harvest the mold in the first place, but she wasn’t about to question it.  </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The way Eliza’s wands were designed, it was quite difficult to utilize multiple poisons at the same time and combining the tinctures had proven ineffective.  Her hope was that she could invent a new poison that would have both a paralyzing effect while also causing damage over time.  That was the goal anyway.  She hadn’t quite figured out the exact formula yet.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">As the mixture in front of her reached the appropriate temperature, Eliza tilted the disc forward and gently scraped the mold into the boiling water.  She then disposed of the disc in the fire that lingered in the corner of the lab.  She had already made the mistake of accidentally bumping into the little petri dish and wasn’t about to repeat that mistake a second time.  The still tender flesh along her wrist and the empty healing vial sitting beside her did a good job of reminding her of her own stupidity.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">She watched anxiously as the mixture on the table flared, changing from orange to a bright yellow before settling into a neutral water-like substance.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre7"> <span class="calibre6"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre53">Potion mixture failed.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre7"> <span class="calibre6"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Damn it,” Eliza muttered, dumping the content of the dish onto the fire – where it sizzled and popped – before leaning back against the workbench and rubbing at her eyes beneath her glasses.  That was at least the twentieth experiment that had failed.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">With a sigh, she looked up, noticing faint rays of sunlight beginning to leak through the shuttered windows of the lab.  It looked like she had spent yet another full night in Alma’s secret laboratory – the older woman having gone to sleep long ago.  Unfortunately, Eliza didn’t have much to show for it.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">While she and Alma had been in Falcon’s Hook, Eliza had made sure to stop by Evan’s shop to order some new merchandise.  She’d purchased new equipment for herself, and for Alma’s lab with the funds provided by Lord Baen.  At the very least, she could partially repay Alma for all of her help and guidance by replacing some of her older alchemy tools.  Once they had made it back to the compound, Eliza had also been excited to try out the new equipment.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Now she needed to complete Lord Baen’s silly quest.  She wasn’t certain what she might find at this “farm” – if that’s really what it was.  She didn’t know why the old trader couldn’t afford to hire other spies.  Maybe he really was desperate and broke.  If that was the case, at least she’d managed to get her money upfront.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre21">I may as well get started</span><span class="calibre6">.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">With that grudging thought, she grabbed her pack and headed for the door.  As she exited the lab, she spared one final glance behind her – noticing that the building blended seamlessly back into the forest as soon as the door closed.  If she hadn’t known the lab was there, she would never have thought to look for it beside the tool shed.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“And how is my favorite little water mage doing this fine day?” a voice said from behind Eliza.  She couldn’t help but groan, already knowing what she would find when she turned around.  Yet that didn’t make the infuriating grin on the Hippie’s face any easier to bear.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“What do you want?” Eliza asked bluntly.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Is that any way to greet your friend and divine benefactor?” the god asked, placing a hand to his chest in mock offense.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“I’m not sure I agree with either of those two descriptions,” Eliza muttered, stomping past the god and heading for the trail leading to the main road.  She had carefully plotted out her course last night after Lord Cairn had updated her map with the location of the farm.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Well, I’ll wear you down eventually!” the Hippie said, unperturbed by her poor humor.  “But, to answer your question, I thought you could use some company on your little hike.  It can be lonely walking the road by yourself.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“How thoughtful of you,” Eliza replied dryly.  “And I’m sure you don’t have any ulterior motive…”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Well, now that you mention it,” the Hippie began with a smile, “You might have noticed that Fluffy is absent today.”  He shook his head, his expression suddenly morose.  “He has really been in a funk since you pointed out that his wool has gotten a bit – </span><span class="calibre21">bushy</span><span class="calibre6">.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Technically, you said it first,” Eliza snapped, glaring at the god.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Hmm, in any event, I want to do something to cheer him up.  He can be quite sensitive about his appearance, you know.  A bit </span><span class="calibre21">sheepish</span><span class="calibre6">, if you catch my drift” he said with a broad smile.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza couldn’t help but groan again.  “One more pun and we’re walking in silence for the rest of the trip.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Fair enough.  But I really would like to do something to help Fluffy get his mojo back.  Something to put a little pep back in his step.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Or rhyming…” Eliza grumbled.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Fine!  Anyway, I was thinking that we could do something to sort of… bedazzle his collar.  Maybe add some bling,” he continued in a distracted voice.  Eliza spared a glance at the god, who was rubbing at his chin thoughtfully.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“What do most people put on a collar?” the Hippie asked.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“I don’t know.  A nametag or something?” Eliza replied.  Leave it to the god of water to be more concerned about his pet’s collar than anything else.  “Or maybe a bell?” she offered half-heartedly.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The Hippie perked up at that, his eyes lighting with excitement.  “That’s a fantastic idea! A bell would be perfect.  It would be stylish – farm-animal-chic even.  And we would never lose him in a crowd!”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Great.  There’s probably a ton of bells that you could buy in Falcon’s Hook,” Eliza said quickly.  “Do we really need to turn this into a–”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">She stopped short as a notification flashed in front of her eyes.</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre7"> <span class="calibre6"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Before Eliza could accept or reject the quest notification, it abruptly disappeared and was automatically added to her quest log.  She yet again resisted the urge to smack the Hippie – although, she was skeptical that she would actually be able to hit him with the way he seemed to teleport about.  Putting aside the fact that the quest hadn’t explained where she was supposed to find a “special” bell, the whole thing just seemed ridiculous.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“This doesn’t even tell me where I’m supposed to find…” she began, only to find that the Hippie had once again deserted her.  Not that she was surprised.  This seemed to be his new MO – drop a quest on her and then bolt.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Coward,” she muttered.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">With another exasperated sigh, Eliza kept walking.  She was sure the details of the idiot god’s latest quest would be revealed eventually.  In the meantime, she could deal with “investigating” this farm for Lord Baen.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">It took Eliza several hours to make it to the location marked on her map.  Lord Baen hadn’t been lying when he explained that the farm was in the middle of nowhere.  The foot traffic on the road leading away from Falcon’s Hook had quickly dwindled, and the forests had given away to rolling hills and plains as Eliza headed steadily north – tall grasses waving in the stiff breeze that drifted through the hills.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">As she crested a final hill, the “farm” came into view.  Eliza came up short, her eyes darting back and forth between the structure in the valley below and the marker on her map.  This couldn’t be right.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“This is a farm?” Eliza asked aloud, her voice incredulous as she tugged her cloak more tightly around her – the wind whipping at the material.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The scene before her didn’t look anything like her mental image of a farm.  There was no red barn or simple farmhouse.  Instead, she was looking at a miniature town, a few dozen buildings ringed by a tall rough-hewn, wooden wall.  Smoke drifted from multiple chimneys, and she could see herds of animals being overseen by shepherds on the hills surrounding the compound.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">As Eliza continued inspecting the “farm,” her brow furrowed in confusion.  Not only was the compound ringed by a rather impressive wall, but there also appeared to be sentries stationed on the ramparts, each man and woman armed with a longbow.  They were attired in matching clothing – which gave them a militaristic appearance.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Her eyes gravitated toward the structure jutting from the center of the compound.  It towered over the other buildings, standing at least three or four stories tall.  At the top was a giant iron bell that swayed gently in the breeze.  Eliza could already feel a heavy weight settle in her stomach as she saw the bell.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Oh, no,” she murmured, backpedaling quickly.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">She wasn’t fast enough to stop the quest update that appeared in front of her.</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre7"> <span class="calibre6"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“You have got to be kidding me.  Can Fluffy even smile?” Eliza asked aloud, looking around for the Hippie.  He had apparently decided not to make an appearance – which was probably a good idea on his part because Eliza was ready to strangle him.  How the hell was she going to retrieve a giant bell from a compound full of armed guards?</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">At that thought, her eyes settled back on the farm.  She should have known better.  Of course, this wasn’t going to be a simple undertaking.  Had any of the god’s quests been easy?  She also couldn’t help but look back on her recent conversation with the Hippie from a fresh perspective.  She wasn’t convinced that this was a coincidence – the god must have known where she was going and that she would find the bell when she got to the farm.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">That thought gave her pause, her stomach twisting and churning.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">She was only undertaking this quest for Lord Baen because she had also completed the bounty for the Silver Stag – another quest that the Hippie had sent her on.  And she had only managed to slay the deer because she had access to the loot in the troll’s cave.  How else would she have been able to pay Evan to craft her wands?</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The more she thought about it, the more the pieces began to click together in her head.  She couldn’t ignore the truth that was staring her in the face – or swinging from an impossibly tall-looking bell tower.  She was starting to suspect that the god wasn’t nearly as stupid or erratic as he looked or acted.  If she was right, then the Hippie had planned all of this, and he had been pulling the strings – the very intricate strings – from the beginning.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Understandably, that didn’t make her feel any better.  Probably because she couldn’t help but ask the next and most obvious question: where was all of this heading?</span> </p>
