   <p class="calibre7"> <span class="calibre6"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The walls of Falcon’s Hook loomed in front of Eliza, the cracked and crumbling edges of the massive stone blocks already visible in the distance.  Players and NPCs filtered along the road beside her and she tugged at her hood to hide her face.  Being around this many people still made her uncomfortable – especially since she now had a </span><span class="calibre21">reputation</span><span class="calibre6">.  Even if she had postponed laying her traps until things had settled down a bit, it didn’t hurt to be careful.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">She managed to pass through the gates with little issue.  The guards only spared her a cursory glance.  Eliza soon wove along the narrow, winding streets of Falcon’s Hook.  Dilapidated wooden buildings towered on either side of her and blotted out the harsh sunlight.  As she paced down a backstreet, she saw a group of players approaching.  They laughed and pushed at each other amicably – not even sparing a glance her way.  However, she still pulled her cloak tighter and kept her head down.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Ice Witch!” a voice suddenly shouted behind Eliza.  “Ice Witch right here!  Come and get her!”  Eliza whirled, her hand clutching a wand and her free hand already moving through the gestures of </span><span class="calibre21">Obscuring Mist</span><span class="calibre6">.  Yet she froze as she discovered the Hippie standing there – a shit-eating grin on his face.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Shut up!” Eliza hissed, moving forward to cover the idiot god’s mouth.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Why?  It’s not like they can hear anything,” he replied, waving a hand at the group of players making their way down the alley behind them.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza could indeed see that the other players hadn’t reacted to the Hippie’s announcement, although one young woman gave Eliza a furtive glance over her shoulder, noticing the water mage gesturing animatedly at thin air.  The woman shook her head and turned back to her group.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“You’re a jerk,” Eliza muttered and promptly turned away from the god.  She needed to meet with Lord Baen, so she continued heading toward the trading house on the eastern edge of the city.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Oh, don’t be like that,” the Hippie said.  “See, Fluffy, some people are just so </span><span class="calibre21">sensitive</span><span class="calibre6">.”  This earned him a soft snort from the animal that trotted along beside the god.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Sensitive?  Because you’re going around screaming about how I’m some sort of homicidal maniac,” Eliza muttered, trying to keep her voice low as she saw the market approaching up ahead.  There were a ton of people around now, and she needed to avoid drawing attention to herself – even if she really wanted to start blasting the god with her </span><span class="calibre21">Ice Bolt</span><span class="calibre6">.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The Hippie shrugged.  “A little bit of murder builds character, that’s what my mother always said,” the god remarked.  Then he hesitated for a moment, his brow furrowing in thought.  “Wait.  Do I even have a mother?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The god spun toward his pet sheep, a look of horror painted on his face.  “Fluffy, I think we might be orphans!”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza and Fluffy rolled their eyes at the same time, sharing a pained look.  “You’re a god,” Eliza murmured, trying her best to resist the urge to start hitting said god.  “You don’t have parents.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“I’m pretty sure that still makes me an orphan,” he replied with a woeful look.  “How could you be so cruel?!”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza knew he was just trying to bait her, and she managed to ignore his crazy antics.  If she stayed quiet, maybe he would get bored and leave – she could only hope anyway.  She spent several long minutes like this as the Hippie jabbered along beside her, seemingly oblivious to the fact that she had stopped responding.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Are you ignoring me now!?” the god suddenly demanded, sticking his face in front of hers and speaking loudly.  “That’s not fair at all.  In fact, it’s quite rude!”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza gritted her teeth together, but she refused to acknowledge the irritating man.  However, that plan didn’t exactly work out the way she intended.  The god proceeded to dance and spin around her, hover his fingers in front of her face, and generally try to annoy her into lashing out at him.  When all of that failed, the god abruptly decided to turn his attention elsewhere.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">A shout erupted from beside Eliza, and she turned to find a group quarreling.  “You stole the sword!” an NPC shouted at a player.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“I didn’t,” the player protested, his expression bewildered.  “You can search me if you like!”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“It was sitting there just a moment ago,” the merchant said, whirling back to a table filled with weapons.  He froze as he looked at the equipment, his brow furrowing.  “It’s… it was gone a second ago… I could have sworn.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The Hippie laughed loudly, thumping his thighs with his hands.  Then he turned his attention elsewhere.  All around the market, items began going missing, only to appear a few seconds later – after starting a fight, of course.  The god also spent some time using tried and true tactics, such as tapping a player on the shoulder and then vanishing.  Within moments, the entire market was in an uproar, and angry shouting filled the air.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“What the hell are you doing?” Eliza hissed at the god.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Well, you were ignoring me, so I thought I’d at least have a little fun,” he explained, trying for a plaintive, innocent expression.  Needless to say, Eliza did not feel sympathetic.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Fine, fine.  I’ll talk to you if you stop messing with people.”  It irked her to give into the god’s antics, but it was probably better than letting him tease other people.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“How kind of you!  </span><span class="calibre21">Anyway</span><span class="calibre6">, how are you coming along with my little quest?” the Hippie asked, now walking sedately beside her.  “I expected you would be done </span><span class="calibre21">ages </span><span class="calibre6">ago.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“It’s been like a day,” Eliza said through clenched teeth.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Really?  It feels like a long time,” the god replied, looking slightly confused.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza’s patience finally snapped, and she stabbed a finger at the god.  “It’s been a day.  A single damn day.  Putting that aside, you sent me off on a mission to recover an enormous freaking bell!  What exactly do you expect me to do here?”  She waved at Fluffy.  “Even if I somehow managed to steal a bell the size of a tractor from a three-story bell tower, how the hell would Fluffy even be able to use it?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The Hippie’s eyes were wide as she laid into him.  Yet instead of getting angry as she finished her tirade, he simply glanced at the nearby players and NPCs – many of whom were now watching Eliza as though she was crazy.  From their point of view, it must look like she was yelling at the air beside her.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“You’re sort of making a scene,” the Hippie said, a broad smile slowly curling his lips.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza struggled to tamp down on her anger, suddenly nervous that so many people were looking at her.  “I hate you,” she muttered before walking off at a brisk pace toward Lord Baen’s trading house.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Oh, don’t be that way,” the god said, hurrying to catch back up to her.  “Besides, if the quest were easy, there wouldn’t be any point.  You told me before that you love fetch quests, so think of this as a giant fetch quest.  Besides, I think Fluffy will look rather fetchi…” he began.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Stop.  No more puns,” Eliza snapped.  “There’s a difference between challenging and impossible.  The bell is several times Fluffy’s size.  What would he even do with it?” Eliza demanded, trying to speak under her breath to avoid drawing any more attention.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“You just leave that to me!” the Hippie said, unaffected by her angry demeanor.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza was nearing the trading house, and she eyed the structure like a runner during a marathon – the finish line in her escape from the god’s stupid antics.  She upped her pace, walking as quickly as she could toward the building.  Yet as she approached the trading house, she suddenly noticed that the god hadn’t vanished, and he still trotted along beside her with Fluffy in tow.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“What a beautiful view,” the Hippie said, marveling at the bay that stretched out below the cliff’s edge.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Uh huh,” Eliza replied noncommittally.  “Don’t you have something else you could be doing?  I need to talk to Lord Baen.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The Hippie turned to look at her with a blank expression.  “Nope.  Our schedule is completely open.  Fluffy made certain not to book anything for today – that way we could spend some quality time with you!”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Lucky me,” Eliza grumbled, glaring at the sheep – who she noticed had edged behind the god to stay out of sight.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">With a sigh, she pushed open the door to the trading house.  She waved at the lone clerk sitting in the nearly vacant building, but the young man barely even looked up – much less tried to block her passage.  A moment later, she tapped hesitantly on the oak doors to Lord Baen’s office.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Come in!” the Lord’s gravelly voice came from within the room.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza spared a final glance at the Hippie.  “You better behave,” she whispered.  This just earned her a grin from the god, and she shook her head.  What was even the point?  The irritating young man wasn’t going to listen to her anyway.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">She pushed open the door gently and stepped inside Lord Baen’s office.  She found the older man sitting at his desk and gazing out at the bay, his fingers drumming absently on the arm of his chair.  As Eliza entered, Lord Baen turned, catching sight of her.  His mouth contorted into a smile, causing the wrinkles on his face to crinkle.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Ahh, Eliza.  It’s good to see you,” the older man said, moving to rise and grabbing for his cane.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza gestured for him to stay seated.  “No need to get up on my account,” she said quietly.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Such a kind soul,” the older man replied.  “So, to what do I owe this visit?” he asked with a raised eyebrow.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“I…,” Eliza began, hesitating as she saw the Hippie standing behind Lord Baen.  The god had snatched the merchant’s cane and was hobbling along the balcony behind the lord, his back crooked and imitating the older man.  She grimaced, but managed to keep speaking, “I managed to visit Tollhouse Farm and wanted to report in with you.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Lord Baen’s eyes lit up, and he leaned forward slightly.  “Oh, really?  What did you discover?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Well, it looks like they are herding sheep,” Eliza began hesitantly, recalling her visit.  “It’s really more of a compound or small town than a farm.  I noticed that it was surrounded by a pretty impressive wall and they maintain sentries on the ramparts.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Interesting,” Lord Baen murmured.  “Was there anything unusual?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Not really,” she began, noticing the lord’s expression begin to fall.  But…”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Ahh, there was something,” he said, gesturing for her to go on.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“I’m not certain this is unusual, but many of their sheep are sick,” she explained cautiously.  “They have cuts along their stomach, and some have become infected.  I also noted some weird matting along their wool.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">When she saw Lord Baen’s considering expression, Eliza continued, “I’m not really sure that helps.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“No, no, that is definitely intriguing,” the merchant explained, his hand rubbing at his chin thoughtfully.  “You mentioned that their wool looked odd.  Was it the sort of thing that might indicate that something had been strapped to the sheep?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">It was Eliza’s turn to be surprised.  “I guess?  What are you suggesting?  That the sheep were carrying something?  Although… that might explain the scratches on their stomach,” she murmured thinking aloud.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The Hippie had ceased his antics and was now paying close attention to the conversation.  He was kneeling beside the merchant’s desk, his arms propping up his head as he glanced back and forth between Eliza and Lord Baen.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“My thoughts exactly,” the older gentleman said, smacking the table.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Lord Baen hesitated, eyeing Eliza critically.  “Perhaps I should elaborate on my fears.  As I mentioned to you and Alma, I suspect that Lord Cairn has been taking advantage of our ships disappearing.  In fact, I believe that he is purposefully waylaying my ships and stealing our cargo – likely flying some of his own fleet under a pirate flag.  However, it has proven difficult to catch him in the act.  Our ships and crews never return intact, and the ready culprit is the mists around Anguine Island.  And with no witnesses…” the lord trailed off, the implication of his words clear.  How did you prove that someone was stealing from you in this sort of situation?</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Wouldn’t he need to load the cargo on his ships to sell it?” Eliza asked tentatively, her thoughts racing as she considered Lord Baen’s predicament.  “That might give you a way to catch him.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Exactly my thought as well,” the merchant replied with a nod.  “However, my spies have been watching the docks closely for weeks now and have seen no sign of our missing cargo arriving in port – much of which is emblazoned with our house crest.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Lord Baen grimaced before continuing, “If our goods aren’t being delivered to the docks, that either means that Lord Cairn isn’t responsible for the loss of our ships – which I highly doubt – or, he has found some way to unload the cargo further up the coast, repackage it, and then transport the merchandise to Falcon’s Hook so that he can deliver it to one of his regular trading partners.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza’s thoughts raced as she considered Lord Baen’s story.  If he was right, then the farm might be a front for delivering the stolen cargo.  Perhaps the “farmers” were actually loading the cargo on the sheep and using them to transport the merchandise to Falcon’s Hook.  The sheep’s fluffy wool would likely conceal the goods, and no one would think to stop and search a group of shepherds.  Eliza could see the Hippie’s smile widen as he watched Eliza and listened to Lord Baen’s story.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“I can see that you have caught on to my suspicion,” Lord Baen said, also observing Eliza carefully.  “If Tollhouse Farm is a front, then Lord Cairn is using it to smuggle goods into the city.  That would also be consistent with the armed guards and the injuries to the sheep that you have observed.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“What do you plan to do then?” Eliza asked cautiously.  She was beginning to suspect that she may have just inadvertently started a war between the two trading houses.  With their significant presence and influence within the city, this likely wouldn’t end well.  She had been in Falcon’s Hook long enough to understand how much the city relied on the trade and work provided by the two houses.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Don’t worry, I don’t plan to start fighting in the streets,” Lord Baen said, waving his hand.  “That would not benefit my house – especially with our already waning resources.  No, we need to strike in a more… </span><span class="calibre21">discrete</span><span class="calibre6"> fashion.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Lord Baen gazed at Eliza evenly, his eyes piercing.  “In fact, I believe you may be able to help me with this task.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“M-me?” Eliza asked in confusion.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Yes, you,” Lord Baen said, arching a single eyebrow.  “After our last visit and your retrieval of the stag’s pelt, I was curious to discover how a novice alchemist had achieved such a feat.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza could feel the bottom drop out of her stomach, and she tried her best to school her face into a neutral expression.  This wasn’t good at all, and the widening grin on the Hippie’s face wasn’t making her feel any better.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“It seems that a large number of travelers and townsfolk have had a run in with this so-called </span><span class="calibre21">Ice Witch</span><span class="calibre6">,” the Lord continued.  “Yet this ‘witch’ only appears to have surfaced recently, and his – or her – traps seem to be centered around the forest the Silver Stag was known to frequent.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The lord leaned forward.  “Now, it’s interesting that a young woman managed to not only slay the creature and avoid the other travelers that were searching for the stag – but also seemed to have no difficulty with this Ice Witch or her traps.  In fact, one might even begin to suspect that you and this Ice Witch were one and the same person.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“I-I…” Eliza began, struggling to form a response.  She had never been much good at lying or improvising on the spot.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“He seems to be on to you,” the Hippie observed, his voice startling Eliza.  She spared a glare at the god before managing to control her expression.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre21">Yeah, no shit</span><span class="calibre6">, she thought in irritation.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“But, I’m not a man who places much stock in rumors,” Lord Baen said, waving a hand and sitting back in his chair.  “What the travelers do among themselves is not my affair.  And I certainly don’t mind that we have a witch in residence in the local forest.  If anything, it adds some mystique to our quaint little city.  I just hope that nothing happens that might reveal her presence prematurely…”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Ahh, the cagey old coot…” the Hippie remarked, nodding in appreciation.  He pointed at the older man.  “Greenmail!  Wait… no, that’s not right.  “Yellowmail maybe?  What does mail have to do with threatening someone anyway?  Maybe they poison the envelope…” he grumbled in frustration.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza had also picked up on the subtext of the lord’s message: </span><span class="calibre21">help me or I reveal who you are</span><span class="calibre6">.  It seemed she had little choice but to play along.  Not that she had any clue what she would be able to do to put a stop to Lord Cairn’s scheme.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“T-that would be unfortunate,” Eliza managed to squeak out, her stomach shifting uncomfortably.  “How exactly do you feel I could help you?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">A sly smile curled Lord Baen’s lips.  “Ahh, well, it would be convenient if something were to happen at Tollhouse Farm that put a stop to Lord Cairn’s illicit business – permanently.  If you understand my meaning, of course.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza’s eyes widened, her thoughts turning to Brian and Clarice.  It was possible that the farm was being used to smuggle goods, but the evidence was circumstantial at best.  Even if they were somehow complicit in some sort of theft, they had also seemed like nice people.  Was Lord Baen asking her to… kill them?</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“What exactly are you suggesting?” she asked nervously.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Lord Baen waved a hand.  “Nothing too untoward.  We don’t need to cause any unnecessary collateral damage.  I only need the flow of stolen goods to stop.  I would be happy to leave the details up to you.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">As the lord finished speaking, a quest notification appeared in front of Eliza.</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Well, the plot thickens,” the Hippie announced loudly, clapping his hands and causing Eliza to start.  “What do you plan to do?”</span> </p>
