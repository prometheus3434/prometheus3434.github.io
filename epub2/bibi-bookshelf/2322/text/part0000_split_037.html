   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza stood outside of Lord Baen’s office.  She was stalling, and she knew it.  After storming away from the Hippie, she had logged out for the evening.  She just hadn’t been able to handle… well, everything.  Not that she was in much better shape now.  She still felt a worm of guilt wriggling in her stomach every time she thought about the farm.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Her eyes rested on the door to the merchant’s office.  She wasn’t certain what to expect from this encounter, but, after dealing with the Hippie for so long, she suspected that this conversation wouldn’t be simple.  Nothing ever was.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">With a sigh, she decided to pull up her character sheet – which would put off the inevitable conversation with Lord Baen for a little bit longer.</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Apparently, the game had given her credit for every farmer and guard killed by the mold – at least that was the only way she could explain her dramatic level and skill increases.  That was just a final twist of the knife for what she had done, but she supposed that there was no way to rewind the clock at this point.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">She also had a ton of stat points to distribute, but she wasn’t quite certain yet how to allocate them.  Eliza had noticed that statistics like </span><span class="calibre21">Strength</span><span class="calibre6"> and </span><span class="calibre21">Endurance</span><span class="calibre6"> helped quite a bit with most practical activities in AO, but she could certainly use more mana and higher mana regeneration.  A little more mana would have helped quite a bit in that last encounter.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">With a flick of her wrist, she brought up her character status.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre7"> <span class="calibre6"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <img src="../images/00008.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre50"/> </p>

   <p class="calibre7"> <span class="calibre6"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">It was hard to believe that she had only started playing a few short weeks ago.  From what she could tell from reading the forums online, she was quite advanced compared to most players.  Although, she doubted that many people laid poisonous traps to kill other players or created mutant molds that could take out a town.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Which brought her attention back to the office door standing in front of her.  She was </span><span class="calibre21">still</span><span class="calibre6"> stalling, but there was no point in putting off this conversation any longer.  She may as well rip off the band-aid so she could get back to Alma’s garden.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">With a final sigh, Eliza knocked tentatively on the door and entered when she heard Lord Baen call out.  She found the older merchant sitting behind his deck, his eyes skimming a weathered piece of parchment.  He looked up at Eliza as she entered, and she noticed him do a double take – perhaps not expecting her.  She detected a strange emotion flit across his face for the briefest of moments.  It almost looked like… fear.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">But that couldn’t be right.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Ahh, Eliza,” Lord Baen said, regaining his composure and mustering his face into a smile.  “It’s a pleasure as always.  Why don’t you take a seat?”  He gestured at the chair across from his desk.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza sat down quickly, not certain how to begin their conversation.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The merchant saved her from making small talk.  He coughed into his sleeve and glanced at her furtively.  “So, I expect you are here to talk about Tollhouse Farm.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Yes,” Eliza said, nodding curtly.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“My spies reported back on the status of the farm,” Lord Baen began in a cautious voice, setting down his parchment and pulling off his glasses as he inspected her closely.  “What... what happened?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza bit her lip as she considered what she wanted to tell the lord.  “Things got out of hand,” she said quietly.  “I created a mold that could eat through the wooden buildings, expecting that this would destroy the compound but the residents would live.”  She hesitated slightly before continuing, her eyes fixed firmly on her hands in her lap, where they twined together in a nervous pattern.  “The mold turned out to be more aggressive than I expected.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Lord Baen leaned forward, his eyes focused on Eliza.  “A mold you say?  What about the fire?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">She nodded quickly.  “I was forced to destroy the fungus to keep it from spreading further.  I…” she began but stopped herself.  There was really no need to explain anything further – like how she had barely saved the entire zone from being overrun by a mutant mold.  Or the fact that they wouldn’t be having this conversation if she hadn’t burned the farm to the ground.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Interesting, interesting,” Lord Baen murmured.  “I could think of several extremely useful applications for this mold if you would be interested in entertaining another small task.  Think of the applications with a ship at sea…”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“No,” Eliza interjected harshly, raising her eyes to glare at the older man before she could stop herself.  She would not be responsible for creating a biological weapon in-game – at least, not again.  As she saw the lord’s shocked reaction, she tried to pull back a bit, her eyes dropping to the table.  “That was the only sample I had, and I’m sure I wouldn’t be able to recreate it.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Ahh, well that’s that then,” the merchant said slowly, but she could see out of the corner of her eye that his expression was skeptical.  Eliza also couldn’t help but notice that his hand had drifted below the table when she snapped at him.  Was he grabbing at a weapon?  Was he really that afraid of her now?</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“In any event, you accomplished my task,” Lord Baen said, both his hands resurfacing above the table.  “The smuggling operation has definitely been stopped, and I don’t see Lord Cairn risking something like that again soon.  Not after he sees the state of the farm…” the merchant trailed off, suddenly looking nervous again.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“You have my thanks,” he finally said.  As Lord Baen finished speaking, another notification crashed down in front of Eliza.</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre7"> <span class="calibre6"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Her eyes skimmed the prompt quickly.  She detected the Hippie’s influence in these notifications.  Yet her gaze lingered on the reward – or lack thereof.  Had she really gone through all of this for nothing?  She had spent most of her remaining funds on the materials to craft the salve for the sheep and the enhancement potions, and she would need to reimburse Alma for the materials she had used when experimenting with the mold as well as the mare and the wagon.  In short, she was broke again.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“About my reward,” Eliza began.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Lord Baen’s eyes widened almost imperceptibly, and his mouth pinched into a line.  “I thought we agreed that my </span><span class="calibre21">discretion</span><span class="calibre6"> was a reward in itself.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">A flash of anger overrode Eliza’s naturally tentative nature.  Was he really going to shake her down even after everything she had gone through?  Two could play at that game.  She hadn’t missed the way the merchant shifted nervously in his seat or how he hesitated to describe the destruction of the farm.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">She knew what Alma would do in this situation.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza met the older man’s gaze evenly, her eyes flashing sapphire as she inadvertently channeled her mana.  “While I appreciate you keeping your </span><span class="calibre21">opinions</span><span class="calibre6"> to yourself, I think some other form of payment would be appropriate.  For example, as you suggested, we wouldn’t want anything untoward to happen to your remaining fleet.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Lord Baen choked slightly and glanced at her angrily.  Eliza continued before he could reply, “Besides, I can’t help but wonder what the travelers and townsfolk would think if you really were to claim that I was this </span><span class="calibre21">Ice Witch</span><span class="calibre6">.  A young water mage and a fledgling alchemist?  This seems far beyond my modest abilities.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">A long silence followed this statement, Lord Baen refusing to meet her gaze.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Then the merchant grimaced, clearly chewing on her words.  However, he made no move to contradict her, which she took as a good sign.  Suddenly, a broad smile broke across the man’s face.  “I can only admire a woman with a strong intellect and a stiff spine.  It seems Alma has taught you well.”  He sighed.  “As to funds, I find myself a little underwater at the moment – so to speak.  However, I could offer you some employment around town if you’re interested.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“What kind of employment?” Eliza questioned with a raised eyebrow.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Nothing like Tollhouse Farm,” Lord Baen amended quickly as he saw her expression.  “Unless you prefer to handle such work, of course.  I was actually thinking of smaller and more mundane tasks.  Our house may not be what it once was, but I do still have some connections.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">As Eliza waited for him to continue, he shifted nervously in his seat.  “For example,” he began, “I know that Tegan at The Seaman’s Folly has been having trouble with our ship crews getting into fights with Lord Cairn’s men.  Someone with your particular skill set might be invaluable in resolving these brawls, and you could earn some easy coin.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza pondered on this for a moment.  Sitting in a tavern would give her a chance to work on her alchemy skills while still making money.  Besides, there was probably a limit to how much trouble she could get into by simply keeping the peace.  She could likely use her </span><span class="calibre21">Obscuring Mist</span><span class="calibre6"> to take care of any unruly sailors while still keeping a low profile.  No one needed to know where the mists came from after all.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“That sounds reasonable,” Eliza said with a nod.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">A grin split Lord Baen’s face.  “Fantastic.  Then I believe we have an arrangement.” He offered a hand to the water mage, a symbolic gesture to seal their deal.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">She eyed his hand for a moment before accepting it.  She still didn’t trust Lord Baen, but as long as she was being cautious, she doubted that he would be able to pull something over on her again.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Having reached an agreement, Eliza made a hasty retreat from the office.  As she stepped outside and the doors clicked shut behind her, she leaned back against the wall.  Her heart was beating rapidly in her chest, and she felt like she had just run a marathon.  That little confrontation had taken a lot out of her.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Maybe I’m just really bad at this,” she murmured, wishing that she had brought Alma along to help her.  The older woman probably could have gotten a few more concessions out of the merchant.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">At least she had these little odd jobs to look forward to.  They seemed simple after everything else she had gone through and might help to take her mind off of what had happened at Tollhouse Farm.  Besides, how much trouble could she really get into working at a tavern?</span> </p>
