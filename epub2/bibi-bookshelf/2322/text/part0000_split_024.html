   <p class="calibre7"> <span class="calibre6"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">It took Eliza a few hours to make her way back to Alma’s cottage.  She had stopped to check on her traps and gather some additional ingredients.  As the familiar compound came into sight, she felt a small wave of sadness sweep over her.  She had spent so much time in the forest over the last few days that she had become accustomed to the background hum of the insects and the dappled sunlight sneaking through the twining patchwork of branches that loomed overhead.  With her quest now complete, she didn’t exactly have a good reason to return.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">However, if she were being honest with herself, she knew that it was more than that.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">On the long trek back to Alma’s cottage, her thoughts had kept returning to how she had killed the players and the eerie calm that had overcome her as she ended each of their lives.  It had almost felt like another person had killed those players.  Once she had let go of her mana, the same sense of guilt and trepidation had come rushing back.  She knew she had done what was necessary, but she had still been unable to meet the vacant gaze of the players she had killed and had quickly fled the lake after retrieving the pelt.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Logically, she knew that she had been killing people for days.  But there was something distinctly different between laying a few traps in the woods and killing other players in cold blood.  She kept telling herself it was just a game, but that explanation rang hollow as she recalled the look in their eyes – and the very real fear she had seen there.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Even worse, a part of her secretly yearned for that sense of balance that had come with channeling her mana.  And the power and triumph she had felt by besting the players.  There was something strangely appealing about becoming the Ice Witch – something freeing.  These sensations were foreign to Eliza, but they had been tantalizing.  She was reluctant to give that up, despite her misgivings about what she had done.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">As a result, it was with mixed feelings that Eliza arrived back at Alma’s compound.  A brief inspection of the grounds revealed that the older woman was absent, possibly working in her hidden laboratory.  Eliza took the opportunity to walk through the garden, inspecting the plants carefully to see if they needed tending as she tried to clear her head.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“It’s always nice to stop and smell the roses on occasion,” the Hippie said, appearing directly beside Eliza.  She jumped, squeaking in surprise, which earned her a wry grin from the god.  “Or massacre a whole slew of players,” he commented with a raised eyebrow.  “Who knew our little water mage was such an accomplished killer!”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza choked back at the lump in her throat at the god’s callous comment before frowning at the irritating young man – her guilt morphing into anger.  “I didn’t have much choice.  You neglected to point out that half of Falcon’s Hook was also hunting the Silver Stag.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The Hippie just shrugged and grinned at her.  “Speaking of which, did you manage to slay our dear deer… huh, now that’s an odd expression!” the Hippie said, coming up short and murmuring the words to himself over and over using different inflections.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Anyway,” Eliza interjected before the god could completely lose focus, “to answer your question, I did retrieve the pelt– although I didn’t technically kill the deer myself.”  As she finished speaking, she pulled the leather bundle from her bag and handed it to the god.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Close enough!” he said, snatching the leather and examining it closely, running his fingers across the silky silver fur and holding it close to his eyes to get a better look – as though he didn’t quite believe it was the genuine article.  As he finished inspecting the leather, his brow furrowed, and a frown tugged at his lips.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Well, this </span><span class="calibre21">looks</span><span class="calibre6"> like the right pelt,” he began slowly before rounding on Eliza.  “But is this vegan, free-range, cruelty-free leather?  Fluffy can be kind of a stickler for that sort of thing, you know.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza just stared at the Hippie.  “What?  What does that even mean?  How can leather be vegan…?  I mean, I helped kill the stag…  You sent me after that creature specifically!”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The Hippie waved a hand in her direction.  “Oh, don’t worry.  We can just tell Fluffy that no animals were harmed in the making of his new collar.  It’s amazing what they can do with pho-fur these days…,” the god murmured to himself, ignoring the fact that Eliza’s face was now flush with confused anger.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Fluffy took this opportunity to make his appearance, circling out from behind a nearby bush and giving the Hippie a long-suffering look.  Apparently, even the sheep had his limits when it came to the god’s inane jabbering.  He stepped toward the Hippie and butted his arm with his head gently as though to say, “Get on with it already.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The god glanced at his pet in surprise.  “Ahh, and here is the sheep of the hour!  I’m ready to make your collar, Fluffy!” he exclaimed excitedly.  With that statement, the god snapped his fingers.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The leather responded immediately, floating into the air as a ribbon of the material was neatly severed by an invisible knife.  The leather band warped and changed before Eliza’s eyes – undergoing an incredibly fast curing process before binding itself into a rather normal-looking collar, replete with metal clasp.  Eliza couldn’t help but wonder where the stitching and metal had come from, but she didn’t really have the heart to ask.  She was certain the god wouldn’t give her a straight answer anyway.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">With the new collar now in hand, the Hippie stepped over to Fluffy and placed it around his neck, clasping it tightly.  “It fits like a glove!  Or… err… a collar, I suppose,” the Hippie said.  “What do you think, Fluffy?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The sheep hopped slightly to the side as he tried to look at the collar that was now bound around his neck.  The leather band made his wool poof up around his head and shoulders, giving him a slightly comical appearance.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“What do you think, Eliza?” the Hippie asked, nudging her with his elbow and giving her a meaningful look.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Oh… I-it looks amazing Fluffy,” she said, trying to muster some enthusiasm.  What she got in return was a suspicious look from the sheep – who hadn’t quite given up on trying to inspect his own collar.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“I think you look majestic!  Truly a marvel to behold really,” the Hippie added, nodding a little too quickly.  “There’s just the matter of your fur kind of bunching…”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The god stopped mid-sentence as Fluffy went suddenly still, glaring at the young man with a deadly expression.  “Wait,” the god said, putting up his hands quickly.  “I was mistaken.  It really doesn’t look bad at all.  A little grooming will fix that situation right up.  You know, a snip here and there.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Fluffy took an ominous step forward toward the Hippie.  “It really doesn’t look bad,” Eliza interjected quickly.  “Your fur is just a little bushy right now.  Maybe you just need a haircut?”  This earned her a glare from the sheep, and then he just seemed to deflate, stepping away from the pair and trudging back behind his bush.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“I told you he can be kind of sensitive,” the Hippie whispered to Eliza, cupping his mouth with his hand conspiratorially.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">He sighed before looking at the water mage with a more serious expression.  “Fluffy’s little tantrum aside, I suppose you still accomplished my quest.”  He waved his hand, and a notification appeared in front of Eliza.</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“So, about that reward…” Eliza said, swiping away her notification and glancing at the water god.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“What reward?” he asked in confusion.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“The reward for completing the quest,” she said slowly, clenching her fists and trying her best not to smack the Hippie upside the head.  After all the time and effort she had put into this, was he really going to leave her hanging?</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Oh, well isn’t the journey the reward itself?” the god replied glibly, waving a dismissive hand.  “You’ve grown so much and become quite popular around town.  If anything, you should probably be </span><span class="calibre21">thanking</span><span class="calibre6"> me.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">He hesitated as he realized that Eliza was now the one glaring at him.  “Uh, okay.  Your reward… right.  I must have left it around here somewhere,” he murmured glancing frantically around the garden.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">His eyes eventually rested on the remaining leather that sat in a haphazard pile on the ground – the Hippie having only used a sliver of the material to create Fluffy’s new collar.  “What about some fine leather?  I also heard there’s a bounty out for the Stag – some guy in Falcon’s Hook really wants it.  Have you heard anything about that?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">It took most of Eliza’s considerable patience not to hit the god.  She should have known better.  He never seemed to plan more than one step ahead – and, even then, he waited until the last minute and acted only on impulse.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Fine.  Just fine,” she muttered, grabbing at the leather and stuffing it into her pack.  She wasn’t sure what she would do with the gold, but she supposed it didn’t really matter.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">She turned to ask the god another question, only to discover that he had disappeared once again.  Eliza couldn’t help but grumble to herself.  What was even the point of these silly quests?  Were they really all about spending time creating accessories for the god’s pet sheep?  Shouldn’t he be doing something more meaningful – like, you know, god things…?</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Although, as she thought about it, would she really want the Hippie answering her prayers or dealing with serious issues like plagues or other disasters?  He was really more likely to cause a flood than stop one.  Perhaps it was best that he was focused on frivolous things.  That was probably safer for everyone – except maybe for her and Fluffy.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“You look like you’ve sucked on something sour,” Alma said from behind Eliza, her cane making a rhythmic thump as she approached.  “Something the matter?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Just idiot gods and their stupid quests,” Eliza muttered.  She held up the edge of the pelt for Alma to see as she continued to stuff the fabric into her pack.  “But I did manage to kill the stag and recover the pelt, which I guess I can turn in for the bounty.  So, that’s a victory I suppose.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“I had no doubt you would come out victorious,” the older woman said with a kindly smile.  Then she glanced up at the sun, noting that it was still early afternoon.  “If you have nothing planned, we could make the trek into town together.  Lord Baen asked for a batch of potions a few days ago, so I’m heading in the same direction.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza nodded, letting out a soft sigh.  She didn’t have anything better to do, so why not?  She spared a glance at the older alchemist out of the corner of her eye as the pair headed for the boundary of her compound, the familiar trail looming before them.  At least Alma would be better company than the Hippie.</span> </p>
