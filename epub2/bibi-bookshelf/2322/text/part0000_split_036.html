   <p class="calibre7"> <span class="calibre6"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza walked through the ruined remains of Tollhouse Farm.  The fire had wiped the compound clean of the mold.  All that was left of it were piles of the insidious vegetation that still smoldered on the ground.  The buildings were nothing more than rubble now.  They had been thoroughly destroyed by both the mold and the fire, creating a large circle of burnt earth and ash where the farm had once stood.  As far as she could tell, none of the mold had survived.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza had been saved by her </span><span class="calibre21">Obscuring Mist</span><span class="calibre6">, the vapor barely managing to push back at the flames that had ravaged the farm – not that she saw this as a blessing.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">She stepped past a burnt corpse, shriveled mold still clinging to its bones – the only evidence that this farm had once been populated by dozens of farmers and staff.  Eliza’s stomach boiled at the sight of the blackened skeleton.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Turning away from the corpse, she continued her solemn march toward the center of the farm.  In only moments, she identified a large object resting on the ground.  It was nearly six feet tall and five feet across, black soot and desiccated fragments of mold covering every inch of its surface.  Eliza stepped up to the object, running her hand across the top.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Dust and debris toppled away, revealing a dull metal underneath.  Eliza grimaced as she confirmed that she was staring at the farm’s bell.  With a few swift gestures, she summoned her </span><span class="calibre21">Obscuring Mist</span><span class="calibre6"> once more – using the water vapor to clean the surface of the bell.  Soon, black soot ran in small rivulets down the metallic surface.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Only a few moments later, the entire bell was revealed.  Apparently, neither the mold nor the fire had been enough to warp or damage the metal.  The bell was now the last remnant of Tollhouse Farm.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza leaned back against the metallic surface, closing her eyes.  She immediately regretted her decision.  Every time she closed her eyes, she saw Brian’s face – intricately twining branches framing his glowing blue eyes.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“I killed them all,” she whispered in a tortured voice.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Despite Lord Baen’s claims, she suspected that many of these people had been innocent of any wrongdoing.  Had they really all known about the smuggling operation?  Had Brian?  Had those shepherds that gave up their lives to stop the mold?  Did she even really have any proof that they had been smuggling anything?  What evidence there might have been had been lost to both the fungus and the fire.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Some small voice whispered in the back of her mind, reminding her that this wasn’t real – it was just a game.  But she mentally recoiled from that line of reasoning.  That had seemed pretty damn real.  This wasn’t the same as what she had done to the players.  These people didn’t respawn.  Their deaths in this world were permanent – just like in real life.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza could feel tears beginning to blossom once more at the corners of her eyes.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Why the long face?” the Hippie suddenly asked, appearing beside her.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza winced at the sound of his voice, but she refused to open her eyes.  A moment later, she felt Fluffy’s wet snout push gently against her hand, but she couldn’t muster the energy to pet the sheep.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Are we playing the silent game now?” the Hippie inquired, his voice sounding much closer.  “Because I am the grandmaster poobah of the silent game!  Just ask Fluffy.  He </span><span class="calibre21">never</span><span class="calibre6"> beats me.  Never.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“What do you want?” Eliza finally snapped, opening her eyes and staring at the irritating god that lingered only a few feet away.  As usual, a broad smile was painted on his clownish face.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“That’s a good question.  World peace?  A cure for cancer?” the Hippie replied, cocking his head.  “Hmm, if you give me some time, I’ll compile a list.  Fair warning, though, it’s going to be a long list.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza just stared at the young man, waiting for him to get serious – not that she had high hopes.  At this stage, she was just mentally done with him.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“You really are a stick in the mud,” the Hippie finally said with a raised eyebrow.  He eyed her critically.  “And after I helped you… which was totally cheating, by the way.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“I was only here in the first place because </span><span class="calibre21">you</span><span class="calibre6"> sent me here,” Eliza said, a dull anger beginning to boil in her veins.  “So, you’ll have to excuse me if I don’t exactly bow down in gratitude.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Hmm, well my help did allow you to destroy all of the mold,” he commented dryly, glancing around the compound as he ran a finger across the surface of the bell, traces of soot clinging to his finger.  “I have to say, Fluffy was getting a bit worried there at the end.”  This earned the god a sideways glance from the sheep, who still hovered protectively beside Eliza.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“I wouldn’t have had to create that fungus if you hadn’t sent me on this stupid quest,” she said, marching toward the Hippie and stabbing a finger at him.  “If it weren’t for your asinine quest to retrieve a freaking bell, I could have found another way to deal with Lord Baen’s task.  These… these people didn’t all have to die.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The Hippie eyed her appraisingly, his expression suddenly sobering.  “Ahh, is that why you seem so upset?  The deaths of some farmers?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Yes,” Eliza shouted.  “I created a mutant fungus that could have wiped out this entire zone – if not the whole continent – and I ended up massacring an entire compound of people.  How could that not fucking upset me?!” she demanded, her voice wavering and cracking as she yelled at the Hippie.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The god simply stared at her for a moment before replying.  “Like everything else, this was a lesson,” he said quietly, holding her gaze.  “Everything dies.  Everything.  You’re a budding doctor in your world, so I’m sure you understand the concept of entropy.  This is a natural cycle – birth and death.  There is no defeating it.  We can only accept it.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Of course, people die,” Eliza snapped, choking back her tears.  She didn’t want the god to see her cry.  “But I’m the one who killed them.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“By accident,” the Hippie amended, still watching her with that same eerily sincere expression.  “You also had your reasons for pursuing my quest – and Lord Baen’s.  And I hear that hindsight is 20/40… wait, I mean 20/20.  Or at least I think I do…”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The god shrugged.  “In any event, did you know this would happen?  Could you have guessed?  Would you give up on your goals simply because there is the risk of failure – even if it might be catastrophic?  Perhaps just sit down in the middle of your garden and die of starvation for fear that you might inadvertently step on a bug on the way to the nearest inn?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“I… I,” Eliza began, struggling to come up with answers to his questions.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">She wanted to continue ranting at the god and blame him for the deaths of the farmers.  However, a part of her knew that he was right – despite how much she might hate to admit it and how much her mind rebelled at the thought that the Hippie could be right about anything.  She hadn’t known this would happen.  This was just a mistake – a huge mistake.  But still a mistake.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“I don’t know,” Eliza finally said.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Well, I expect that’s the best we can hope for,” the Hippie said, clapping his hands together and causing Eliza to jump in surprise.  “But, in any event, you’re wrong.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza stared at the Hippie, her eyes widening slightly.  “Wrong about what?” she asked in a tentative voice.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“You didn’t actually kill </span><span class="calibre21">everyone</span><span class="calibre6">,” the god continued, pacing the area around the bell and kicking at the ash that covered the ground.  “That’s just so dramatic!  It’s like, totally unbecoming of you,” he continued in mock valley-girl accent.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“What… what do you mean?” Eliza asked, ignoring his teasing and looking around in confusion.  She had walked through the entire area.  She hadn’t seen any survivors – even the shepherds and sheep that they had left in the hills in their haste.  Eliza could only assume that they must have fled when they saw the fires.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Hmm, did you check inside the bell?” the Hippie asked, looking at her with an inquiring expression.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza’s brow furrowed in confusion.  Was the god messing with her?  He wasn’t above pulling pranks – even at a time like this.  However, she still stepped around the bell so that she could see inside.  At first, she only saw dark soot and more fragments of mold.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“There isn’t anything…” she began.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Look closer,” the Hippie interrupted quietly.  “You have to look a bit deeper than the surface.  You really shouldn’t judge a book by its cover, after all.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza hesitantly reached a hand forward, scraping away at the ash.  A few seconds later, she uncovered a small patch of dirt, and she saw a flash of green.  She homed in on the foreign object, gently pushing away the loose debris.  A moment later, a small sprout came into view – its emerald leaves standing out in stark contrast to the dreary gray ash and soil.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“What is this…?” Eliza whispered.  Instinctively, she inspected the sapling.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre7"> <span class="calibre6"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre33">Strange Sapling – Level Unknown</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre32"> <span class="calibre34">This sapling appears innocuous at first blush – a simple tendril of life amid the destruction you have caused.  Yet a closer inspection reveals that this plant is more than it initially appears.  Mana courses through its veins and its leaves feel warm to the touch.  If you hold your breath, you can even detect a faint thrumming – the sensation similar to a human heartbeat.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre32"> <span class="calibre34">Health – Unknown</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre32"> <span class="calibre34">Mana – Unknown</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre32"> <span class="calibre34">Equipment – Unknown</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre32"> <span class="calibre34">Resistances – Unknown</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre7"> <span class="calibre6"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">She stared at the prompt in shock for a long moment.  The game registered the sapling as a creature – not as a plant or item.  The text also seemed to indicate that this was more than merely some stray weed.  As these thoughts raced through her mind, Eliza finally realized what she was cradling in her hands.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Is t-this Brian?” she asked in a tortured voice, her eyes insistent as she stared at the Hippie.  “Don’t mess with me.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“It’s what is left of him,” the Hippie replied, leaning down beside her to inspect the sapling.  “Like I said, life is a cycle – death and rebirth.  An endless merry-go-round without end.  Except that it doesn’t come with charming music or cotton candy.  Hmm, now that I say it out loud, maybe it’s just a really super depressing ride.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“What does this mean, though?” Eliza demanded, whirling to face the infuriating god and ignoring his idiotic jabbering.  A faint seed of hope had blossomed in her heart, but she was afraid to water it.  “Is he alive?  Can I bring him back?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“I suppose that’s technically possible,” the Hippie replied, tapping his lips thoughtfully.  “Although you don’t have the sufficient skills or affinity to do it yet.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Could Alma…?” Eliza began before drifting into silence as she saw the god shake his head, a grin starting to curl his lips.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza’s gaze bounced back and forth between the sapling and the god as a sudden realization settled over her.  She knew what the Hippie was doing.  He was using her.  Again.  Manipulating her into continuing to put up with his nonsense with only the faint hope that she might be able to bring Brian back.  She felt anger flare in her veins once more, but she tamped down on the emotion.  Rage wouldn’t help her here.  She couldn’t change what had happened, only decide how to move forward.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The only question was whether she would keep going or stop here.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The conversation with her parents flashed through Eliza’s mind.  The harsh comments of her peers.  Lord Baen’s blackmail.  She always let others push her around, forcing her to do things she hated.  Would she let the Hippie do the same thing?</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">However, this was different.  She </span><span class="calibre21">wanted</span><span class="calibre6"> to bring Brian back – she owed him that.  Was she really being forced into this?  Or was the Hippie offering her an opportunity to correct her mistake – if only partly?</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Fine,” Eliza finally muttered.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">She pulled a vial from her bag and gently scraped the sapling free from the bell before depositing it into its new home.  As the small plant settled inside the vial, Eliza could see that small blue veins dotted its leaves, pulsing slightly with water mana.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre21">I’m going to find a way to bring you back</span><span class="calibre6">, she promised herself, staring at the tiny sapling and her finger running gently down the edge of the glass vial.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Anyhoo…,” the Hippie began in an animated voice, jumping back to his feet.  “I believe we also still need to settle the matter of your quest!  About that bell…”  he trailed off, staring at the massive metallic object.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza stared along with him.  Her wagon was still likely sitting on the hill outside of the farm – assuming the mare hadn’t run off in all of the commotion.  However, she had used her entire stash of enhancement potions on Brian, so she had no way to lift bell into the bed of the wagon and return it to Alma’s compound.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre21">Fantastic.  After everything, I’ll probably still fail this stupid quest.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“Geez, why do you look so morose again?” the Hippie demanded.  “You have the bell right here.  So now we get to accessorize!”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">As he finished speaking, the god snapped his fingers.  At first, nothing happened.  Only a moment later, however, bands of water mana began to materialize around the bell, wrapping around its surface and squeezing.  Eliza’s eyes widened in surprise as she saw the bell begin to shrink, growing ever smaller until it could fit into the palm of her hand.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Then the Hippie dipped down, retrieved the miniature bell, and affixed it to the collar around Fluffy’s neck.  The sheep did a little dance as he tried to look at his new accessory, but it was in such an awkward position that he couldn’t quite manage to get a clear look at it.  As he shook his head, the bell made a gentle chime.  Fluffy froze, mesmerized, before proceeding to shake his head back and forth – causing the bell to ring continuously.  He seemed enamored with the sound, letting out a little bleat.  As he did so, a notification appeared in front of Eliza.</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">Eliza ignored the prompt that had appeared in front of her, still staring at the bell on the sheep’s collar.  Then she whirled on the Hippie.  “Are you kidding me right now?  You could shrink the bell this entire time?  Why did we go through any of this?!”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The young man’s grin widened slightly as he watched Eliza screaming at him, his irritating smile only serving to make her even angrier.  After all of his mysterious godly bullshit and that philosophical monologue, he had just been messing with her after all!</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">“That’s it!” she yelled, stuffing the sapling vial in her pack and started off toward the spot where she left her wagon – a string of expletives following her as she stormed off.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre6">The Hippie watched her stalk away for a long moment before turning to Fluffy where he glared in disapproval at the god.  “Okay, fine.  You were right,” the god admitted sullenly.  “She was a </span><span class="calibre21">little</span><span class="calibre6"> upset…”</span> </p>
