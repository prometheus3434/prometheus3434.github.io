<p class="p3"><span class="sz">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="sz"><i>Cahit Koytak&#8217;&#305;n bir t&#252;r davet ve manifesto niteli&#287;inde olan </i>2015 &#8211; Ermenilerle Helalle&#351;me <i>adl&#305; &#351;iiri 24 Nisan 2013&#8217;te Taraf gazetesine yay&#305;mlanm&#305;&#351;t&#305;. &#304;ngilizceye &#231;evirmeyi g&#246;rev bildim.</i></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="sz">Cahit Koytak, born 1949, is probably the greatest living poet of the Turkish language. He is a devout Muslim, a man of vast and philosophical vision, a jazz lover, a latter-day Sufi. He published this poem on April 24, 2013, the 98<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the Armenian tragedy.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="sz">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="sz">Koytak is a difficult poet to translate &#8211; his sinuous syntax hardly carries into English, and the suggestivenes of phrase may sound hollow to unfamiliar ears. I have done my best. You must take me on my word that the original is good poetry as well as a powerful call to action.</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="sz">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="sz">Shall we be reconciled when we admit to be the heirs of Union and Progress, &nbsp;<br/>that band of devilish murderers, &nbsp;<br/>and apologize in their name?<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="sz">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="sz">Shall we, who swear by the honesty of the Prophet and witness to the unity of God, &nbsp;<br/>we who never stood, never stood willingly, in the ranks of those murderers&nbsp;<br/><span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; </span>in their path of rage and bloodshed,&nbsp;<br/>shall we ask for reconciliation&nbsp;<br/>for having never moved a finger to seek justice and to redress the crime,&nbsp;<br/>for nearly a century,&nbsp;<br/>though we all knew of the enormity of the crime, &nbsp;<br/>and knew the perpetrators,&nbsp;<br/>and yet pretended that there was nothing amiss,&nbsp;<br/>and tolerated those who said so?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="sz">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="sz">Shall we seek reconciliation,&nbsp;<br/>we who are the other members of the same great family, sharing the same house,&nbsp;<br/>for failing to see, blindly, for so many years,&nbsp;<br/>that what was done to them, and to their children, was done to us,&nbsp;<br/>and that their pain, and the pain of their grandchildren, was our pain, &nbsp;<br/>and for doing nothing to call out for justice, and to lighten their burden?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="sz">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="sz">Shall we offer reconciliation&nbsp;<br/>for our indifference, our carelessness, our blindness?&nbsp;<br/>For sitting on, or for keeping silent while others sat, for so many years,&nbsp;<br/>on the homes, on the gardens and fields and the villages &nbsp;<br/><span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; </span>from which the Armenians were driven so brutally?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="sz">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="sz">*</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="sz">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="sz">Or, to deserve a great and true reconciliation, &nbsp;<br/>for all this and for all our other debts and perfidies,&nbsp;<br/>shall we open our heart wide enough,&nbsp;<br/>and invite them back into it, their home?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="sz">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="sz">Shall we open our heart wide enough,&nbsp;<br/>to deserve a true and great reconciliation,&nbsp;<br/>that we wish them to come back, with joy and trust,&nbsp;<br/>to the homes, the villages, the fields and gardens which are theirs,&nbsp;<br/><span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;&#160; &#160; </span>and see to it that they do so safe and secure, and with a cloudless heart?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="sz">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="sz">Shall we make our table broad enough,&nbsp;<br/>to deserve this great redemption,&nbsp;<br/>that we tell them &#8220;the earth belongs to God, and is wide enough;&nbsp;<br/>the earth is His, and we are His family;&nbsp;<br/>His is the land, the house, the shop, the fields and the grain that we all share at His table,&nbsp;<br/>His bounty is large enough to be yours and ours, and this country is your land as well as ours?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="sz">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="sz">Shall we open our bosom wide enough,&nbsp;<br/>that we reach across the frontier at Ardahan, and call,&nbsp;<br/>&#8220;see, we live under the same skies, &nbsp;<br/>the same rainclouds wet our fields and our forelocks,&nbsp;<br/>our dreams share the same night,&nbsp;<br/>so let us fling open not only the gates,&nbsp;<br/>but the boundary itself, &nbsp;<br/>and render it as nothing,&nbsp;<br/>and let our arms which reach out to embrace you&nbsp;<br/>be long enough to circle the globe,&nbsp;<br/>to Peru, Argentina and Arizona,&nbsp;<br/>to embrace your spread-out seed&#8221;?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="sz">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="sz">Shall our hearts generate a joy great enough &nbsp;<br/>that we proclaim the year 2015 &#8220;The Year of Armenian Homecoming&#8221;, &nbsp;<br/>and turn it into a year of &nbsp;<br/>homecoming feasts, &nbsp;<br/>homecoming rites, &nbsp;<br/>and homecoming follies?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="sz">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="sz">Shall our soul generate candor and goodwill enough,&nbsp;<br/>and kindness and love great enough to fill the heavens and the earth,&nbsp;<br/>that we invite the lost sons, the lost daughters, and the estranged children of this family,&nbsp;<br/>not only back to their homes in their homeland,&nbsp;<br/>not only to their homes and gardens here,&nbsp;<br/>but back to their homes in our heart,&nbsp;<br/>to the gardens and fields that blossom in our arms,&nbsp;<br/>into the mountains and valleys of our inner soul?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="sz">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="sz">Shall we, to deserve this year of 2015 as a year of Birth,&nbsp;<br/>not only for us and the Armenians, but for all mankind,&nbsp;<br/>a year of homecoming, a year of rediscovery,&nbsp;<br/>a year to breathe in the spirit of God, and the great communion that embraces us all,&nbsp;<br/>can we, the Muslims, weep for those children and women, and the elderly,&nbsp;<br/>who were driven from their homes, murdered, allowed to perish on the road,&nbsp;<br/>abused and soiled and dishonored,&nbsp;<br/>by the devils of that time,&nbsp;<br/>as much as we weep for the victims of Kerbela,&nbsp;<br/>for Hasan and Huseyn, and their women and children?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="sz">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="sz">And shall the year 2015 be, for them too, the Armenians, &nbsp;<br/>a year of reconciliation, a year of joy and redemption,&nbsp;<br/>that they shall deserve by weeping&nbsp;<br/>for the pain of those other sons and daughters of the family,&nbsp;<br/>victims of the mayhem of Hnchakists, Tashnakists and what other wild band, &nbsp;<br/>loosed at a time when our house was on fire,&nbsp;<br/>and for those who, more recently, &nbsp;<br/>lost their homes and their land, and their lives, in Karabagh? &nbsp;<br/>Shall they weep, as they weep for Jesus son of Mary,&nbsp;<br/>or at least lend an ear of sympathy to those who weep?</span></p>
