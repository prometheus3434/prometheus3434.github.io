<p class="p4"><span class="sz"><b>We Like Our Armenians Nice and Soft</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="sz">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="sz"><i>ABD&#8217;nin Kaliforniya eyaletinde Ermeni konular&#305;yla ilgili Ianyan adl&#305; bir dergi &#231;&#305;karan </i><a href="http://nisanyan1.blogspot.com/2013/05/liana-aghajanian-interview.html"><i>Liana Aghajanian&#8217;&#305;n sorular&#305;na cevaplar&#305;m.</i></a></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="sz">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="sz"><b>Receiving criticism for your writing and thoughts is something you&#8217;ve had experience with in the past &#8211; how do you deal with this? Do you take any of these threats seriously, do they scare you?</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="sz">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="sz">I receive a daily deluge of extremely graphic insults and death threats. One gets used to them after a while, though. They do not scare me any more. As far as I know no politically-motivated assassination has ever taken place in this country unless ordered from high up. I doubt that in the current atmosphere the powers that be would have either the inclination or the courage to create another Armenian martyr.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="sz">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="sz"><b>Prosecutors have accused you of &#8220;overstepping the boundaries of freedom of speech and criticism.&#8221; What is your response to this accusation?</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="sz">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="sz">The quality of legal education in Turkey is abysmal. Evidently this young prosecutor was under the illusion that saying something mildly distasteful to the prevailing religious opinion is beyond the boundaries of free speech.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="sz">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="sz"><b>You previously said, &#8220;Here I am an Armenian doing something no Armenian has done in a Muslim country. This is really the height of boldness, of impudence. This is something you are not supposed to do.&#8221; How did your ethnic background play a role in this prosecution and lengthy sentence you received?</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="sz">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="sz">I believe it was the key issue. People are simply not used to a member of a non-Muslim minority speaking boldly and coherently on sensitive national and/or religious issues. It drives some people mad.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="sz">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="sz"><b>What kind of experience have you had as an Armenian writer in Turkey, or just as a citizen of Turkey? What challenges do Armenians or minorities in general face in Turkey today?</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="sz">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="sz">Prejudice and ignorance are still rampant, but things have improved vastly in the last decade. Goodwill is now the dominant note among opinion leaders. I have received some very positive, very encouraging endorements from the better-informed segments of the Turkish public.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="sz">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="sz">But even there, you find this underlying sense that an Armenian should never come so openly forward. You know, &#8220;we all love our Armenians, but we like them nice and soft.&#8221; That about summarizes the dominant attitude.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="sz">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="sz"><b>I noticed that some Armenian Diasporans on social networks have compared what has happened in your case to that of Hrant Dink, calling for the State Department to protest your sentencing. What kind of similarities, if any, exist between you and him?</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="sz">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="sz">A hate campaign was systematically mounted against Hrant over a period of two years. There was judicial harrassment, barking mobs, death threats and terrifying headlines in the trashy press. My experience has been very similar so far. Except that Hrant was attacked primarily by the secular nationalists, and I am attacked mainly by the religious camp. These are considered the opposite poles of the political spectrum here.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="sz">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="sz"><b>You have vowed to appeal your sentence. What do you think or hope will come of this?</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="sz">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="sz">It is an outrageous verdict in legal terms, so I expect the higher court may throw it out. What they will do next, if that happens, is to harrass me on some other, preferably non-political charge. I have a dozen other criminal cases pending on silly bureaucratic charges. That has been going on for almost twenty years now, and I doubt they they will give up any time soon.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="sz">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="sz"><b>In your article, you said you argued that hate speech is only criminal if it actually puts the rights or security of a vulnerable group in jeopardy. You wrote the blog post in response to the furor around the film. What in particular struck a chord in you and compelled you to write about it? Did you expect the commotion it caused?</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="sz">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="sz">There was an uproar here last year over that cheap anti-Islamic film [<i>The Innocence of Muslims</i>], and several top politicians close to the prime minister took the opportunity sound out a new Hate Speech Law curtailing &#8220;disrespect&#8221; of Islamic values. I thought then (and I still think now) that this is a serious threat to public freedoms. I had the urge to discuss the idea of &#8220;hate speech&#8221; and its limits.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="sz">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="sz">I confess that this article by Daniel Pipes (<i>http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2012/09/24/mocking-muhammad-is-not-hate-speech/</i>) was the immediate source of inspiration for my note. I am not a fan of either Mr. Pipes or Fox News. But I felt they had a good point here.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="sz">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="sz"><b>What are your thoughts on the freedom of expression (or seriously lack thereof) in Turkey today?</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="sz">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="sz">Historically, the military establishment has been the biggest threat to civic rights and freedoms in this country. The government of Tayyip Erdo&#287;an has done a great job of dismantling that apparatus of military dominance. It is a pity that now a counter-wave of Islamic bigotry seems to be on the rise.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="sz">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="sz"><b>You have previously served time in jail &#8211; what was that experience like, if you were to sum it up?</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="sz">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="sz">It is like being at a particulary stupid boarding school. Nothing really terrible, just tedious and sometimes infuriating. I had plenty of time to concentrate on my linguistic work. The first edition of my etymological dictionary shaped up in jail. A few months in the cage now might be a good chance for me to work on the next revised edition.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="sz">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="sz"><b>You mention in your latest blog post that several individuals around Turkey filed complaints about the article. Do you have any idea who they are? And what does their offense at your post mean in the larger scheme of things?</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="sz">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="sz">Muslim opinion was muzzled in this country for almost three generations. Now that the muzzle is off, I think some people are testing their newly acquired voice.</span></p>
