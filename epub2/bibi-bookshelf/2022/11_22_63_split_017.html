<a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">CHAPTER 5</span></span></p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">1</span></span></p><p class="calibre21">I walked along the side of the drying shed, just like before. I ducked under the chain with the <span class="bold">NO ADMITTANCE BEYOND THIS POINT</span> sign hanging from it, just like before. I walked around the corner of the big green-painted cube of a building just like before, and then something smacked into me. I’m not particularly heavy for my height, but I’ve got some meat on my bones—“You won’t blow away in a high wind,” my father used to say—and still the Yellow Card Man almost knocked me over. It was like being attacked by a black overcoat full of flapping birds. He was yelling something, but I was too startled (not scared, exactly, it was all too quick for that) to have any idea what it was.</p><p class="calibre13">I pushed him away and he stumbled back against the drying shed with his coat swirling around his legs. There was a bonk sound when the back of his head struck the metal, and his filthy fedora tumbled to the ground. He followed it down, not in a tumble but in a kind of accordion collapse. I was sorry for what I’d done even before my heart had a chance to settle into a more normal rhythm, and sorrier still when he picked up his hat and began brushing at it with one dirty hand. The hat was never going to be clean again, and, in all probability, neither was he.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">“Are you okay?” I asked, but when I bent down to touch his shoulder, he went scuttering away from me along the side of the shed, pushing with his hands and sliding on his butt. I’d say he looked like a crippled spider, but he didn’t. He looked like what he was: a wino with a brain that was damp going on wet. A man who might be as close to death as Al Templeton was, because in this fifty-plus-years-ago America there were probably no charity-supported shelters or rehabs for guys like him. The VA might take him if he’d ever worn the uniform, but who would take him to the VA? Nobody, probably, although someone—a mill foreman would be the most likely—might call the cops on him. They’d put him in the drunk tank for twenty-four or forty-eight hours. If he didn’t die of DT-induced convulsions while he was in there, they’d turn him loose to start the next cycle. I found myself wishing my ex-wife was here—she could find an AA meeting and take him to it. Only Christy wouldn’t be born for another twenty-one years.</p><p class="calibre13">I put the briefcase between my feet and held my hands out to show him they were empty, but he cringed even further down the side of the drying shed. Spittle gleamed on his stubbly chin. I looked around to be sure we weren’t attracting attention, saw that we had this part of the millyard to ourselves, and tried again. “I only pushed you because you startled me.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Who the fuck <span class="italic">are</span> you?” he asked, his voice cracking through about five different registers. If I hadn’t heard the question on my last visit, I wouldn’t have had any idea what he was asking . . . and although the slur was the same, wasn’t the inflection a little different this time? I wasn’t sure, but I thought so. <span class="italic">He’s harmless, but he’s not like anyone else,</span> Al had said. <span class="italic">It’s like he</span> knows <span class="italic">something</span>. Al thought it was because he happened to be sunning himself near the rabbit-hole at 11:58 in the morning on September 9, 1958, and was susceptible to its influence. The way you can produce static on a TV screen if you run a mixer close to it. Maybe that was it. Or, hell, maybe it was just the booze.</p><p class="calibre13">“Nobody important,” I said in my most soothing voice. “Nobody you need to concern yourself with. My name’s George. What’s yours?”</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">“Motherfucker!” he snarled, and scrambled yet further from me. If that was his name, it was certainly an unusual one. “You’re not supposed to be here!”</p><p class="calibre13">“Don’t worry, I’m leaving,” I said. I picked up the briefcase to demonstrate my sincerity, and he hunched his thin shoulders all the way up to his ears, as if he expected me to hurl it at him. He was like a dog that’s been beaten so often it expects no other treatment. “No harm and no foul, okay?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Get out, bastard-ball! Go back to where you came from <span class="italic">and leave me alone</span>!”</p><p class="calibre13">“It’s a deal.” I was still recovering from the startle he’d given me, and the residual adrenaline mixed badly with the pity I felt—not to mention the exasperation. The same exasperation I’d felt with Christy when I came home to discover she was drunk-going-on-shitfaced again in spite of all her promises to straighten up, fly right, and quit the booze once and for all. The combination of emotions added to the heat of this late summer midday was making me feel a little sick to my stomach. Probably not the best way to start a rescue mission.</p><p class="calibre13">I thought of the Kennebec Fruit and how good that root beer had been; I could see the gasp of vapor from the ice cream freezer as Frank Anicetti Senior pulled out the big mug. Also, it had been blessedly cool in there. I started in that direction with no further ado, my new (but carefully aged around the edges) briefcase banging against the side of my knee.</p><p class="calibre13">“Hey! Hey, you, whatsyaface!”</p><p class="calibre13">I turned. The wino was struggling to his feet, using the side of the drying shed as a support. He had snagged his hat and was holding it crushed against his midsection. Now he began to fumble at it. “I got a yellow card from the greenfront, so gimme a buck, motherfucker. Today’s double-money day.”</p><p class="calibre13">We were back on message. That was comforting. Nonetheless, I took pains not to approach him too closely. I didn’t want to scare him again or provoke another attack. I stopped six feet away and held out my hand. The coin Al had given me gleamed on my palm. “I can’t spare a buck, but here’s half a rock.”</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">He hesitated, now holding his hat in his left hand. “You better not want a suck-job.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Tempting, but I think I can resist.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Huh?” He looked from the fifty-cent piece to my face, then back down at the money again. He raised his right hand to wipe the slick of drool off his chin, and I saw another difference from before. Nothing earth-shattering, but enough to make me wonder about the solidity of Al’s claim that each time was a complete reset.</p><p class="calibre13">“I don’t care if you take it or leave it, but make up your mind,” I said. “I’ve got things to do.”</p><p class="calibre13">He snatched the coin, then cowered back against the drying shed again. His eyes were large and wet. The slick of drool had reappeared on his chin. There’s really nothing in the world that can match the glamour of a late-stage alcoholic; I can’t think why Jim Beam, Seagram’s, and Mike’s Hard Lemonade don’t use them in their magazine ads. Drink Beam and see a better class of bugs.</p><p class="calibre13">“Who are you? What are you doing here?”</p><p class="calibre13">“A job, I hope. Listen, have you tried AA for that little problem you’ve got with the boo—”</p><p class="calibre13">“Fuck off, Jimla!”</p><p class="calibre13">I had no idea what a jimla might be, the <span class="italic">fuck off</span> part came through loud and clear. I headed for the gate, expecting him to hurl more questions after me. He hadn’t before, but this encounter had been markedly different.</p><p class="calibre13">Because he wasn’t the Yellow Card Man, not this time. When he raised his hand to wipe his chin, the card clutched in it had no longer been yellow.</p><p class="calibre13">This time it was a dirty but still bright orange.</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">2</span></span></p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre21">I threaded my way through the mill parking lot, once again tapping the trunk of the white-over-red Plymouth Fury for good luck. I was certainly going to need all of that I could get. I crossed the train tracks, once again hearing the <span class="italic">wuff-chuff</span> of a train, only this time it sounded a little more distant, because this time my encounter with the Yellow Card Man—who was now the Orange Card Man—had taken a bit longer. The air stank of mill effluent as it had before, and the same inter-city bus snored past. Because I was a little late this time, I couldn’t read the route sign, but I remembered what it said: LEWISTON EXPRESS. I wondered idly how many times Al had seen that same bus, with the same passengers looking out the windows.</p><p class="calibre13">I hurried across the street, waving away the blue cloud of bus exhaust as best I could. The rockabilly rebel was at his post outside the door, and I wondered briefly what he’d say if I stole his line. But in a way that would be as mean as terrorizing the drying shed wino on purpose; if you stole the secret language belonging to kids like this, they didn’t have much left. This one couldn’t even go back and pound on the Xbox. So I just nodded.</p><p class="calibre13">He nodded back. “Hi-ho, Daddy-O.”</p><p class="calibre13">I went inside. The bell jingled. I went past the discount comic books and straight to the soda fountain where Frank Anicetti Senior was standing. “What can I do for you today, my friend?”</p><p class="calibre13">For a moment I was stumped, because that wasn’t what he’d said before. Then I realized it wouldn’t be. Last time I’d grabbed a newspaper out of the rack. This time I hadn’t. Maybe each trip back to 1958 reset the odometer back to all zeros (with the exception of the Yellow Card Man), but the first time you varied something, everything was up for grabs. The idea was both scary and liberating.</p><p class="calibre13">“I could use a root beer,” I said.</p><p class="calibre13">“And I can use the custom, so we’ve got a meeting of the minds. Five-or ten-cent beer?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Ten, I guess.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Well, I think you guess right.”</p><p class="calibre13">The frost-coated mug came out of the freezer. He used the handle of the wooden spoon to scrape off the foam. He filled it to the top and set it in front of me. All just like before.</p><p class="calibre13">“That’s a dime, plus one for the governor.”</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">I handed over one of Al’s vintage dollars, and while Frank 1.0 made change, I looked over my shoulder and saw the former Yellow Card Man standing outside the liquor store—the <span class="italic">greenfront</span>—and swaying from side to side. He made me think of a Hindu fakir I’d seen in some old movie, tooting a horn to coax a cobra out of a wicker basket. And, coming up the sidewalk, right on schedule, was Anicetti the Younger.</p><p class="calibre13">I turned back, sipped my root beer, and sighed. “This hits the spot.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Yep, nothing like a cold beer on a hot day. Not from around here, are you?”</p><p class="calibre13">“No, Wisconsin.” I held out my hand. “George Amberson.”</p><p class="calibre13">He shook it as the bell over the door jangled. “Frank Anicetti. And there comes my boy. Frank Junior. Say hello to Mr. Amberson from Wisconsin, Frankie.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Hello, sir.” He gave me a smile and a nod, then turned to his dad. “Titus has got the truck up on the lift. Says it’ll be ready by five.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Well, that’s good.” I waited for Anicetti 1.0 to light a cigarette and wasn’t disappointed. He inhaled, then turned back to me. “Are you traveling on business or for pleasure?”</p><p class="calibre13">For a moment I didn’t respond, but not because I was stumped for an answer. What was throwing me was the way this scene kept diverging from and then returning to the original script. In any case, Anicetti didn’t seem to notice.</p><p class="calibre13">“Either way, you picked the right time to come. Most of the summer people are gone, and when that happens we all relax. You want a scoop of vanilla ice cream in your beer? Usually it’s five cents extra, but on Tuesdays I reduce the price to a nickel.”</p><p class="calibre13">“You wore that one out ten years ago, Pop,” Frank Junior said amiably.</p><p class="calibre13">“Thanks, but this is fine,” I said. “I’m on business, actually. A real estate closing up in . . . Sabattus? I think that’s it. Do you know that town?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Only my whole life,” Frank said. He jetted smoke from his nostrils, then gave me a shrewd look. “Long way to come for a real estate closing.”</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">I returned a smile that was supposed to communicate <span class="italic">if you knew what I know.</span> It must have gotten across, because he tipped me a wink. The bell over the door jingled and the fruit-shopping ladies came in. The DRINK CHEER-UP COFFEE wall clock read 12:28. Apparently the part of the script where Frank Junior and I discussed the Shirley Jackson story had been cut from this draft. I finished my root beer in three long swallows, and as I did, a cramp tightened my bowels. In novels characters rarely have to go potty, but in real life, mental stress often provokes a physical reaction.</p><p class="calibre13">“Say, you don’t happen to have a men’s room, do you?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Sorry, no,” Frank Senior said. “Keep meaning to put one in, but in the summer we’re too busy and in the winter there never seems to be enough cash for the renovations.”</p><p class="calibre13">“You can go around the corner to Titus,” Frank Junior said. He was scooping ice cream into a metal cylinder, getting ready to make himself a milkshake. He hadn’t done that before, and I thought with some unease about the so-called butterfly effect. I thought I was watching that butterfly unfurl its wings right before my eyes. We were changing the world. Only in small ways—infinitesimal ways—but yes, we were changing it.</p><p class="calibre13">“Mister?”</p><p class="calibre13">“I’m sorry,” I said. “Had a senior moment.”</p><p class="calibre13">He looked puzzled, then laughed. “Never heard that one before, but it’s pretty good.” Because it was, he might repeat it the next time he lost his own train of thought. And a phrase that otherwise wouldn’t enter the bright flow of American slanguage until the seventies or eighties would make an early debut. You couldn’t say a <span class="italic">premature</span> debut, exactly, because on this time-stream it would be right on schedule.</p><p class="calibre13">“Titus Chevron is around the corner on your right,” Anicetti Senior said. “If it’s . . . uh . . . urgent, you’re welcome to use our bathroom upstairs.”</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">“No, I’m fine,” I said, and although I’d already looked at the wall clock, I took an ostentatious glance at my Bulova on the cool Speidel band. It was a good thing they couldn’t see the face, because I’d forgotten to reset it and it was still on 2011 time. “But I’ve got to be going. Errands to run. Unless I’m very lucky, they’ll tie me up for more than a day. Can you recommend a good motel around here?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Do you mean a motor court?” Anicetti Senior asked. He butted his cigarette in one of the WINSTON TASTES GOOD ashtrays that lined the counter.</p><p class="calibre13">“Yes.” This time my smile felt foolish rather than in-the-know . . . and my bowels cramped again. If I didn’t take care of that problem soon, it was going to develop into an authentic 911 situation. “Motels are what we call them in Wisconsin.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Well I’d say the Tamarack Motor Court, about five miles up 196 on your way to Lewiston,” Anicetti Senior said. “It’s near the drive-in movie.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Thanks for the tip,” I said, getting up.</p><p class="calibre13">“You bet. And if you want to get trimmed up before any of your meetings, try Baumer’s Barber Shop. He does a real fine job.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Thanks. Another good tip.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Tips are free, root beers are sold American. Enjoy your time in Maine, Mr. Amberson. And Frankie? You drink that milkshake and get on back to school.”</p><p class="calibre13">“You bet, Pop.” This time it was Junior who tipped a wink in my direction.</p><p class="calibre13">“Frank?” one of the ladies called in a yoo-hoo voice. “Are these oranges fresh?”</p><p class="calibre13">“As fresh as your smile, Leola,” he replied, and the ladies tee-hee’d. I’m not trying to be cute here; they actually tee-hee’d.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">I passed them, murmuring “Ladies” as I went by. The bell jingled and I went out into the world that had existed before my birth. But this time instead of crossing the street to the courtyard where the rabbit-hole was, I walked deeper into that world. Across the street, the wino in the long black coat was gesticulating at the tunic-wearing clerk. The card he was waving might be orange instead of yellow, but otherwise he was back on script.</p><p class="calibre13">I took that as a good sign.</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">3</span></span></p><p class="calibre21">Titus Chevron was beyond the Red &amp; White Supermarket, where Al had bought the same supplies for his diner over and over again. According to the sign in the window, lobster was going for sixty-nine cents a pound. Across from the market, standing on a patch of ground that was vacant in 2011, was a big maroon barn with the doors standing open and all sorts of used furniture on display—cribs, cane rockers, and overstuffed easy chairs of the “Dad’s relaxin’” type seemed in particularly abundant supply. The sign over the door read THE JOLLY WHITE ELEPHANT. An additional sign, this one an A-frame propped to catch the eye of folks on the road to Lewiston, made the audacious claim that IF WE DON’T HAVE IT, YOU DON’T NEED IT. A fellow I took to be the proprietor was sitting in one of the rocking chairs, smoking a pipe and looking across at me. He wore a strap-style tee-shirt and baggy brown slacks. He also wore a goatee, which I thought equally audacious for this particular island in the time-stream. His hair, although combed back and held in place with some sort of grease, curled down to the nape of his neck and made me think of some old rock-and-roll video I’d seen: Jerry Lee Lewis jumping on his piano as he sang “Great Balls of Fire.” The proprietor of the Jolly White Elephant probably had a reputation as the town beatnik.</p><p class="calibre13">I tipped a finger to him. He gave me the faintest of nods and went on puffing his pipe.</p><p class="calibre13">At the Chevron (where regular was selling for 19.9 cents a gallon and “super” was a penny more), a man in blue coveralls and a strenuous crewcut was working on a truck—the Anicettis’, I presumed—that was up on the lift.</p><p class="calibre13">“Mr. Titus?”</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">He glanced over his shoulder. “Ayuh?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Mr. Anicetti said I could use your restroom?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Key’s inside the front door.” <span class="italic">Doe-ah.</span></p><p class="calibre13">“Thank you.”</p><p class="calibre13">The key was attached to a wooden paddle with MEN printed on it. The other key had GIRLS printed on the paddle. My ex-wife would have shit a brick at that, I thought, and not without glee.</p><p class="calibre13">The restroom was clean but smoky-smelling. There was an urn-style ashtray beside the commode. From the number of butts studding it, I would guess a good many visitors to this tidy little room enjoyed puffing as they pooped.</p><p class="calibre13">When I came out, I saw two dozen or so used cars in a small lot next to the station. A line of colored pennants fluttered above them in a light breeze. Cars that would have sold for thousands<br class="calibre6"/>—as classics, no less—in 2011 were priced at seventy-five and a hundred dollars. A Caddy that looked in nearly mint condition was going for eight hundred. The sign over the little sales booth (inside, a gum-chewing, ponytailed cutie was absorbed in <span class="italic">Photoplay</span>) read: ALL THESE CARS RUN GOOD AND COME WITH THE BILL TITUS GUARENTEE <span class="bold">WE SERVICE WHAT WE SELL!</span></p><p class="calibre13">I hung the key up, thanked Titus (who grunted without turning from the truck on the lift), and started back toward Main Street, thinking it would be a good idea to get my hair cut before visiting the bank. That made me remember the goatee-wearing beatnik, and on impulse I crossed the street to the used furniture emporium.</p><p class="calibre13">“Morning,” I said.</p><p class="calibre13">“Well, it’s actually afternoon, but whatever makes you happy.” He puffed his pipe, and that light late-summer breeze brought me a whiff of Cherry Blend. Also a memory of my grandfather, who used to smoke it when I was a kid. He sometimes blew it in my ear to quell the earache, a treatment that was probably not AMA-approved.</p><p class="calibre13">“Do you sell suitcases?”</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">“Oh, I got a few in my kick. No more’n two hundred, I’d say. Walk all the way to the back and look on your right.”</p><p class="calibre13">“If I buy one, could I leave it here for a couple of hours, while I do some shopping?”</p><p class="calibre13">“I’m open until five,” he said, and turned his face up into the sun. “After that you’re on your own.”</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">4</span></span></p><p class="calibre21">I traded two of Al’s vintage dollars for a leather valise, left it behind the beatnik’s counter, then walked up to Main Street with my briefcase banging my leg. I glanced into the greenfront and saw the clerk sitting beside the cash register and reading a newspaper. There was no sign of my pal in the black overcoat.</p><p class="calibre13">It would have been hard to get lost in the shopping district; it was only a block long. Three of four storefronts up from the Kennebec Fruit, I came to Baumer’s Barber Shop. A red-and-white barber pole twirled in the window. Next to it was a political poster featuring Edmund Muskie. I remembered him as a tired, slope-shouldered old man, but this version of him looked almost too young to vote, let alone get elected to anything. The poster read, SEND ED MUSKIE TO THE U.S. SENATE, VOTE DEMOCRAT! Someone had put a bright white band around the bottom. Hand-printed on it was THEY SAID IT COULDN’T BE DONE IN MAINE BUT <span class="italic">WE DID IT!</span> NEXT UP: HUMPHREY IN 1960!</p><p class="calibre13">Inside, two old parties were sitting against the wall while an equally old third party got his tonsure trimmed. Both of the waiting men were puffing like choo-choos. So was the barber (Baumer, I assumed), with one eye squinted against the rising smoke as he clipped. All four studied me in a way I was familiar with: the not-quite-mistrustful look of appraisal that Christy once called the Yankee Glare. It was nice to know that some things hadn’t changed.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">“I’m from out of town, but I’m a friend,” I told them. “Voted the straight Democratic ticket my whole life.” I raised my hand in a so-help-me-God gesture.</p><p class="calibre13">Baumer grunted with amusement. Ash tumbled from his cigarette. He brushed it absently off his smock and onto the floor, where there were several crushed butts among the cut hair. “Harold there’s a Republican. You want to watch out he don’t bitecha.”</p><p class="calibre13">“He ain’t got the choppers for it nummore,” one of the others said, and they all cackled.</p><p class="calibre13">“Where you from, mister?” Harold the Republican asked.</p><p class="calibre13">“Wisconsin.” I picked up a copy of <span class="italic">Man’s Adventure</span> to forestall further conversation. On the cover, a subhuman Asian gent with a whip in one gloved hand was approaching a blonde lovely tied to a post. The story that went with it was called JAP SEX-SLAVES OF THE PACIFIC. The barbershop’s smell was a sweet and completely wonderful mixture of talcum powder, pomade, and cigarette smoke. By the time Baumer motioned me to the chair, I was deep into the sex-slaves story. It wasn’t as exciting as the cover.</p><p class="calibre13">“Been doin some traveling, Mr. Wisconsin?” he asked as he settled a white rayon cloth over my front and wrapped a paper collar around my neck.</p><p class="calibre13">“Quite a lot,” I said truthfully.</p><p class="calibre13">“Well, you’re in God’s country now. How short do you want it?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Short enough so I don’t look like”—a<span class="italic"> hippie,</span> I almost finished, but Baumer wouldn’t know what that was—“like a beatnik.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Let it get a little out of control, I guess.” He began to clip. “Leave it much longer and you’d look like that faggot who runs the Jolly White Elephant.”</p><p class="calibre13">“I wouldn’t want that,” I said.</p><p class="calibre13">“Nosir, he’s a sight, that one.” <span class="italic">That-un.</span></p><p class="calibre13">When Baumer finished, he powdered the back of my neck, asked me if I wanted Vitalis, Brylcreem, or Wildroot Cream Oil, and charged me forty cents.</p><p class="calibre13">I call that a deal.</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">5</span></span></p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre21">My thousand-dollar deposit at the Hometown Trust raised no eyebrows. The freshly barbered look probably helped, but I think it was mostly being in a cash-and-carry society where credit cards were still in their infancy . . . and probably regarded with some suspicion by thrifty Yankees. A severely pretty teller with her hair done up in tight rolls and a cameo at her throat counted my money, entered the amount in a ledger, then called over the assistant manager, who counted it again, checked the ledger, and then wrote out a receipt that showed both the deposit and the total in my new checking account.</p><p class="calibre13">“If you don’t mind me saying so, that’s a mighty big amount to be carrying in checking, Mr. Amberson. Would you like to open a savings account? We’re currently offering three percent interest, compounded quarterly.” He widened his eyes to show me what a wonderful deal this was. He looked like that old-time Cuban bandleader, Xavier Cugat.</p><p class="calibre13">“Thanks, but I’ve got a fair amount of business to transact.” I lowered my voice. “Real estate closing. Or so I hope.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Good luck,” he said, lowering his own to the same confidential pitch. “Lorraine will fix you up with checks. Fifty enough to go on with?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Fifty would be fine.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Later on, we can have some printed with your name and your address.” He raised his eyebrows, turning it into a question.</p><p class="calibre13">“I expect to be in Derry. I’ll be in touch.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Fine. I’m at Drexel eight four-seven-seven-seven.”</p><p class="calibre13">I had no idea what he was talking about until he slid a business card through the window. Gregory Dusen, Assistant Manager, was engraved on it, and<span class="bold"> DRexel 8-4777</span>.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">Lorraine got my checks and a faux alligator checkbook to put them in. I thanked her and dropped them into my briefcase. At the door I paused for a look back. A couple of the tellers were working adding machines, but otherwise the transactions were all of the pen-and-elbow-grease variety. It occurred to me that, with a few exceptions, Charles Dickens would have felt at home here. It also occurred to me that living in the past was a little like living underwater and breathing through a tube.</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">6</span></span></p><p class="calibre21">I got the clothes Al had recommended at Mason’s Menswear, and the clerk told me yes, they would be more than happy to take a check, providing it was drawn on a local bank. Thanks to Lorraine, I could oblige in that regard.</p><p class="calibre13">Back at the Jolly White Elephant, the beatnik watched silently as I transferred the contents of three shopping bags to my new valise. When I snapped it shut, he finally offered an opinion. “Funny way to shop, man.”</p><p class="calibre13">“I guess so,” I said. “But it’s a funny old world, isn’t it?”</p><p class="calibre13">He cracked a smile at that. “In my opinion, that’s a big you-bet. Slip me some skin, Jackson.” He extended his hand, palm up.</p><p class="calibre13">For a moment it was like trying to figure out what the word <span class="italic">Drexel</span> attached to some numbers was all about. Then I remembered <span class="italic">Dragstrip Girl,</span> and understood the beatnik was offering the fifties version of a fist-bump. I dragged my palm across his, feeling the warmth and the sweat, thinking again: <span class="italic">This is real. This is happening.</span></p><p class="calibre13">“Skin, man,” I said.</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">7</span></span></p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre21">I crossed back to Titus Chevron, swinging the newly loaded valise from one hand and the briefcase from the other. It was only midmorning in the 2011 world I’d come from, but I felt tired out. There was a telephone booth between the service station and the adjacent car lot. I went in, shut the door, and read the hand-printed sign over the old-fashioned pay phone: REMEMBER PHONE CALLS NOW A DIME COURTESY OF “MA” BELL.</p><p class="calibre13">I thumbed through the Yellow Pages in the local phone book and found Lisbon Taxi. Their ad featured a cartoon cab with eyes for headlights and a big smile on its grille. It promised FAST, COURTEOUS SERVICE. That sounded good to me. I grubbed for my change, but the first thing I came up with was something I should have left behind: my Nokia cell phone. It was antique by the standards of the year I’d come from—I’d been meaning to trade up to an iPhone—but it had no business here. If someone saw it, I’d be asked a hundred questions I couldn’t answer. I stowed it in the briefcase. It would be okay there for the time being, I guessed, but I’d have to get rid of it eventually. Keeping it would be like walking around with an unexploded bomb.</p><p class="calibre13">I found a dime, dropped it in the slot, and it went right through to the coin return. I fished it out, and one look was enough to pinpoint the problem. Like my Nokia, the dime had come from the future; it was a copper sandwich, really no more than a penny with pretensions. I pulled out all my coins, poked through them, and found a 1953 dime I’d probably got in change from the root beer I’d bought at the Kennebec Fruit. I started to put it in, then had a thought that made me feel cold. What if my 2002 dime had gotten stuck in the phone’s throat instead of falling through to the coin return? And what if the AT&amp;T man who serviced the pay phones in Lisbon Falls had found it?</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="italic">He would have thought it was a joke, that’s all. Just some elaborate prank.</span></p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">I somehow doubted this—the dime was too perfect. He would have shown it around; there might even eventually have been an item about it in the newspaper. I had gotten lucky this time, but next time I might not. I needed to be careful. I thought of my cell phone again, with deepening unease. Then I put the 1953 dime in the coin slot and was rewarded with a dial tone. I placed the call slowly and carefully, trying to remember if I’d ever used a phone with a rotary dial before. I thought not. Each time I released it, the phone made a weird clucking sound as the dial spun back.</p><p class="calibre13">“Lisbon Taxi,” a woman said, “where the mileage is always smileage. How may we help you today?”</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">8</span></span></p><p class="calibre21">While I waited for my ride, I window-shopped my way through Titus’s car lot. I was particularly taken by a red ’54 Ford convertible—a Sunliner, according to the script below the chrome headlight on the driver’s side. It had whitewall tires and a genuine canvas roof that the cool cats in <span class="italic">Dragstrip Girl</span> would have called a ragtop.</p><p class="calibre13">“That ain’t a bad one, mister,” Bill Titus said from behind me. “Goes like a house afire, that I can testify to personally.”</p><p class="calibre13">I turned. He was wiping his hands on a red rag that looked almost as greasy as his hands.</p><p class="calibre13">“Some rust on the rocker panels,” I said.</p><p class="calibre13">“Yeah, well, this climate.” He gave a whattaya-gonna-do shrug. “Main thing is, the motor’s in nifty shape and those tires are almost new.”</p><p class="calibre13">“V-8?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Y-block,” he said, and I nodded as if I understood this perfectly. “Bought it from Arlene Hadley over Durham after her husband died. If there was one thing Bill Hadley knew, it was how to take care of a car . . . but you won’t know them because you’re not from around here, are you?”</p><p class="calibre13">“No. Wisconsin. George Amberson.” I held out my hand.</p><p class="calibre13">He shook his head, smiling a little. “Good to meet you, Mr. Amberson, but I don’t want to getcha all over grease. Consider it shook. You a buyer or a looker?”</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">“I don’t know yet,” I said, but this was disingenuous. I thought the Sunliner was the coolest car I’d ever seen in my life. I opened my mouth to ask what kind of mileage it got, then realized it was a question almost without meaning in a world where you could fill your tank for two dollars. Instead I asked him if it was a standard.</p><p class="calibre13">“Oh, ayuh. And when you catch second, you want to watch out for the cops. She goes like a bastid in second. Want to take er out for a spin?”</p><p class="calibre13">“I can’t,” I said. “I just called a cab.”</p><p class="calibre13">“That’s no way to travel,” Titus said. “If you bought this, you could go back to Wisconsin in style and never mind the train.”</p><p class="calibre13">“How much are you asking? This one doesn’t have a price on the windshield.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Nope, just took it in trade day before yest’y. Haven’t got around to it.” <span class="italic">Gut.</span> He took out his cigarettes. “I’m carryin it at three-fifty, but tell you what, I’d dicker.” <span class="italic">Dicka.</span></p><p class="calibre13">I clamped my teeth together to keep my jaw from dropping and told him I’d think it over. If my thinking went the right way, I said, I’d come back tomorrow.</p><p class="calibre13">“Better come early, Mr. Amberson, this one ain’t gonna be on the lot for long.”</p><p class="calibre13">I was again comforted. I had coins that wouldn’t work in pay phones, banking was still done mostly by hand, and the phones made an odd chuckling sound in your ear when you dialed, but some things didn’t change.</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">9</span></span></p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre21">The taxi driver was a fat man who wore a battered hat with a badge on it reading LICENSED LIVERY. He smoked Luckies one after the other and played WJAB on the radio. We listened to “Sugartime” by the McGuire Sisters, “Bird Dog” by the Everly Brothers, and “Purple People Eater,” by some creature called a Sheb Wooley. That one I could have done without. After every other song, a trio of out-of-tune young women sang: “<span class="italic">Four</span>-teen <span class="italic">for</span>-ty, WJA-<span class="italic">beee</span> . . . the Big <span class="italic">Jab</span>!” I learned that Romanow’s was having their annual end-of-summer blowout sale, and F. W. Woolworth’s had just gotten a fresh order of Hula Hoops, a steal at $1.39.</p><p class="calibre13">“Goddam things don’t do nothin but teach kids how to bump their hips,” the cabbie said, and let the wing window suck ash from the end of his cigarette. It was his only stab at conversation between Titus Chevron and the Tamarack Motor Court.</p><p class="calibre13">I unrolled my window to get away from the cigarette smog a little and watched a different world roll by. The urban sprawl between Lisbon Falls and the Lewiston city line didn’t exist. Other than a few gas stations, the Hi-Hat Drive-In, and the outdoor movie theater (the marquee advertised a double feature consisting of <span class="italic">Vertigo</span> and <span class="italic">The Long, Hot Summer</span>—both in CinemaScope and Technicolor), we were in pure Maine countryside. I saw more cows than people.</p><p class="calibre13">The motor court was set back from the highway and shaded not by tamaracks but by huge and stately elms. It wasn’t like seeing a herd of dinosaurs, but almost. I gawked at them while Mr. Licensed Livery lit up another smoke. “Need a hand witcher bags, sir?”</p><p class="calibre13">“No, I’m fine.” The fare on his meter wasn’t as stately as the elms, but still rated a double take. I gave the guy two dollars and asked fifty cents back. He seemed satisfied with that; the tip was enough to buy a pack of Luckies.</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">10</span></span></p><p class="calibre21">I checked in (no problem there; cash on the counter and no ID required) and took a long nap in a room where the air-conditioning was a fan on the windowsill. I awoke refreshed (good) and then found it impossible to get to sleep that night (not good). There was next to no traffic on the highway after sundown, and the quiet was so deep it was disquieting. The television was a Zenith table model that must have weighed a hundred pounds. Sitting on top was a pair of rabbit ears. Propped against them was a sign reading ADJUST ANTENNA BY HAND <span class="italic">DO NOT USE “TINFOIL!”</span> THANKS FROM MANAGEMENT.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">There were three stations. The NBC affiliate was too snowy to watch no matter how much I fiddled with the rabbit ears, and on CBS the picture rolled; adjusting the vertical hold had no effect. ABC, which came in clear as a bell, was showing <span class="italic">The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp,</span> starring Hugh O’Brian. He shot a few outlaws and then an ad for Viceroy cigarettes came on. Steve McQueen explained that Viceroys had a thinking man’s filter and a smoking man’s taste. While he was lighting up, I got off the bed and turned the TV off.</p><p class="calibre13">Then there was just the sound of the crickets.</p><p class="calibre13">I stripped to my shorts, lay down, and tried to sleep. My mind turned to my mother and father. Dad was currently six years old and living in Eau Claire. My mom, only five, was living in an Iowa farmhouse that would burn to the ground three or four years from now. Her family would then move to Wisconsin, and closer to the intersection of lives that would eventually produce . . . me.</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="italic">I’m crazy,</span> I thought. <span class="italic">Crazy and having a terribly involved hallucination in a mental hospital somewhere. Perhaps some doctor will write me up for a psychiatric journal. Instead of The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat, I’ll be The Man Who Thought He Was in 1958.</span></p><p class="calibre13">But I ran my hand over the nubby fabric of the bedspread, which I had yet to turn back, and knew that it was all true. I thought of Lee Harvey Oswald, but Oswald still belonged to the future and he wasn’t what was troubling me in this museum piece of a motel room.</p><p class="calibre13">I sat on the edge of the bed, opened the briefcase, and took out my cell phone, a time-traveling gadget that was absolutely worthless here. Nevertheless, I could not resist flipping it open and pushing the power button. NO SERVICE popped up in the window, of course—what had I expected? Five bars? A plaintive voice saying <span class="italic">Come home, Jake, before you cause damage you can’t undo</span>? Stupid, superstitious idea. If I did damage, I <span class="italic">could</span> undo it, because every trip was a reset. You could say that time-travel came with a built-in safety switch.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">That was comforting, but having a phone like this in a world where color TV was the biggest technological breakthrough in consumer electronics wasn’t comforting at all. I wouldn’t be hung as a witch if I was found with it, but I might be arrested by the local cops and held in a jail cell until some of J. Edgar Hoover’s boys could arrive from Washington to question me.</p><p class="calibre13">I put it on the bed, then pulled all of my change out of my right front pocket. I separated the coins into two piles. Those from 1958 and earlier went back into my pocket. Those from the future went into one of the envelopes I found in the desk drawer (along with a Gideon Bible and a Hi-Hat takeout menu). I got dressed, took my key, and left the room.</p><p class="calibre13">The crickets were much louder outside. A broken piece of moon hung in the sky. Away from its glow, the stars had never seemed so bright or close. A truck droned past on 196, and then the road was still. This was the countryside, and the countryside was sleeping. In the distance, a freight train whistled a hole in the night.</p><p class="calibre13">There were only two cars in the courtyard, and the units they belonged to were dark. So was the office. Feeling like a criminal, I walked into the field behind the motor court. High grass whickered against the legs of my jeans, which I would swap tomorrow for my new Ban-Lon slacks.</p><p class="calibre13">There was a smoothwire fence marking the edge of the Tamarack’s property. Beyond it was a small pond, what rural people call a tank. Nearby, half a dozen cows were sleeping in the warm night. One of them looked up at me as I worked my way under the fence and walked to the tank. After that it lost interest and lowered its head again. It didn’t raise it when my Nokia cell phone splashed into the pond. I sealed the envelope with my coins inside it and sent it after the phone. Then I went back the way I came, pausing at the rear of the motel to make sure the courtyard was still empty. It was.</p><p class="calibre13">I let myself into my room, undressed, and was asleep almost instantly.</p><div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_18"></div></body>
