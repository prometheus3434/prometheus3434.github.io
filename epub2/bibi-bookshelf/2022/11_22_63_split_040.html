<a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">CHAPTER 25</span></span></p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">1</span></span></p><p class="calibre21">I stayed with Sadie on the morning of August fifth until they put her on a gurney and rolled her down to the operating room. There Dr. Ellerton was waiting for her, along with enough other docs to field a basketball team. Her eyes were shiny with preop dope.</p><p class="calibre13">“Wish me luck.”</p><p class="calibre13">I bent and kissed her. “All the luck in the world.”</p><p class="calibre13">It was three hours before she was wheeled back to her room—same room, same picture on the wall, same horrible squatting commode—fast asleep and snoring, the left side of her face covered in a fresh bandage. Rhonda McGinley, the nurse with the fullback shoulders, let me stay with her until she came around a little, which was a big infraction of the rules. Visiting hours are more stringent in the Land of Ago. Unless the head nurse has taken a shine to you, that is.</p><p class="calibre13">“How are you?” I asked, taking Sadie’s hand.</p><p class="calibre13">“Sore. And sleepy.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Go back to sleep then, honey.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Maybe next time . . .” Her words trailed off in a furry <span class="italic">hzzzzz</span> sound. Her eyes closed, but she forced them open with an effort. “. . . will be better. In your place.”</p><p class="calibre13">Then she was gone, and I had something to think about.</p><p class="calibre13">When I went back to the nurses’ station, Rhonda told me that Dr. Ellerton was waiting for me downstairs in the cafeteria.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">“We’ll keep her tonight and probably tomorrow, too,” he said. “The last thing we want is for any sort of infection to develop.” (I thought of this later, of course—one of those things that’s funny, but not very.)</p><p class="calibre13">“How did it go?”</p><p class="calibre13">“As well as can be expected, but the damage Clayton inflicted was very serious. Pending her recovery, I’m going to schedule her second go-round for November or December.” He lit a cigarette, chuffed out smoke, and said: “This is a helluva surgical team, and we’re going to do everything we can . . . but there are limits.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Yes. I know.” I was pretty sure I knew something else, as well: there were going to be no more surgeries. Here, at least. The next time Sadie went under the knife, it wouldn’t be a knife at all. It would be a laser.</p><p class="calibre13">In <span class="italic">my</span> place.</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">2</span></span></p><p class="calibre21">Small economies always come back and bite you in the ass. I’d had the phone taken out of my Neely Street apartment in order to save eight or ten dollars a month, and now I wanted it. But there was a U-Tote-M four blocks away with a phone booth next to the Coke cooler. I had de Mohrenschildt’s number on a scrap of paper. I dropped a dime and dialed.</p><p class="calibre13">“De Mohrenschildt residence, how may I help you?” Not Jeanne’s voice. A maid, probably—where <span class="italic">did</span> the de Mohrenschildt bucks come from?</p><p class="calibre13">“I’d like to speak to George, please.”</p><p class="calibre13">“I’m afraid he’s at the office, sir.”</p><p class="calibre13">I grabbed a pen from my breast pocket. “Can you give me that number?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Yes, sir. CHapel 5-6323.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Thanks.” I wrote it on the back of my hand.</p><p class="calibre13">“May I say who called, if you don’t reach him, sir?”</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">I hung up. That chill was enveloping me again. I welcomed it. If I’d ever needed cold clarity, it was now.</p><p class="calibre13">I dropped another dime and this time got a secretary who told me I’d reached the Centrex Corporation. I told her I wanted to speak to Mr. de Mohrenschildt. She, of course, wanted to know why.</p><p class="calibre13">“Tell him it’s about Jean-Claude Duvalier and Lee Oswald. Tell him it’s to his advantage.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Your name, sir?”</p><p class="calibre13">Puddentane wouldn’t do here. “John Lennon.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Please hold, Mr. Lennon, I’ll see if he’s available.”</p><p class="calibre13">There was no canned music, which on the whole seemed an improvement. I leaned against the wall of the hot booth and stared at the sign reading IF YOU SMOKE, PLEASE TURN ON FAN. I didn’t smoke, but turned the fan on, anyway. It didn’t help much.</p><p class="calibre13">There was a click in my ear loud enough to make me wince, and the secretary said, “You’re connected, Mr. D.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Hello?” That jovial booming actor’s voice. “Hello? Mr. Lennon?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Hello. Is this line secure?”</p><p class="calibre13">“What do you . . . ? Of course it is. Just a minute. Let me shut the door.”</p><p class="calibre13">There was a pause, then he was back. “What’s this about?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Haiti, my friend. And oil leases.”</p><p class="calibre13">“What’s this about <span class="italic">Monsieur</span> Duvalier and that guy Oswald?” There was no worry in his voice, just cheerful curiosity.</p><p class="calibre13">“Oh, you know them both much better than that,” I said. “Go ahead and call them Baby Doc and Lee, why don’t you?”</p><p class="calibre13">“I’m awfully busy today, Mr. Lennon. If you don’t tell me what this is about, I’m afraid I’ll have to—”</p><p class="calibre13">“Baby Doc can approve the oil leases in Haiti you’ve been wanting for the last five years. You know this; he’s his father’s righthand man, he runs the <span class="italic">tonton macoute,</span> and he’s next in line for the big chair. He likes you, and <span class="italic">we</span> like you—”</p><p class="calibre13">De Mohrenschildt began to sound less like an actor and more like a real guy. “When you say <span class="italic">we,</span> do you mean—”</p><p class="calibre13">“We <span class="italic">all</span> like you, de Mohrenschildt, but we’re worried about your association with Oswald.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Jesus, I hardly know the guy! I haven’t seen him in six or eight months!”</p><p class="calibre13">“You saw him on Easter Sunday. You brought his little girl a stuffed rabbit.”</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">A very long pause. Then: “All right, I guess I did. I forgot about that.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Did you forget about someone taking a shot at Edwin Walker?”</p><p class="calibre13">“What has that got to do with <span class="italic">me</span>? Or my business?” His puzzled outrage was almost impossible to disbelieve. Key word: <span class="italic">almost</span>.</p><p class="calibre13">“Come on, now,” I said. “You accused Oswald of doing it.”</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="italic">“I was joking, goddammit!”</span></p><p class="calibre13">I gave him two beats, then said, “Do you know what company I work for, de Mohrenschildt? I’ll give you a hint—it’s <span class="italic">not</span> Standard Oil.”</p><p class="calibre13">There was silence on the line while de Mohrenschildt ran through the bullshit I’d spouted so far. Except it <span class="italic">wasn’t</span> bullshit, not entirely. I’d known about the stuffed rabbit, and I’d known about the how-did-you-miss crack he’d made after his wife spotted the rifle. The conclusion was pretty clear. My company was The Company, and the only question in de Mohrenschildt’s mind right now—I hoped—was how much more of his no doubt interesting life we’d bugged.</p><p class="calibre13">“This is a misunderstanding, Mr. Lennon.”</p><p class="calibre13">“I hope for your sake that it is, because it looks to us like you might have primed him to take the shot. Going on and on about what a racist Walker is, and how he’s going to be the next American Hitler.”</p><p class="calibre13">“That’s totally untrue!”</p><p class="calibre13">I ignored this. “But it’s not our chief worry. Our chief worry is that you may have accompanied Mr. Oswald on his errand last April tenth.”</p><p class="calibre13">“<span class="italic">Ach, mein Gott!</span> That’s insane!”</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">“If you can prove that—and if you promise to stay away from the unstable Mr. Oswald in the future—”</p><p class="calibre13">“He’s in New Orleans, for God’s sake!”</p><p class="calibre13">“Shut up,” I said. “We know where he is and what he’s doing. Handing out Fair Play for Cuba leaflets. If he doesn’t stop soon, he’ll wind up in jail.” Indeed he would, and in less than a week. His uncle Dutz—the one associated with Carlos Marcello—would go his bail. “He’ll be back in Dallas soon enough, but you won’t see him. Your little game is over.”</p><p class="calibre13">“I tell you I never—”</p><p class="calibre13">“Those leases can still be yours, but not unless you can prove you weren’t with Oswald on April tenth. Can you do that?”</p><p class="calibre13">“I . . . let me think.” There was a long pause. “Yes. Yes, I think I can.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Then let’s meet.”</p><p class="calibre13">“When?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Tonight. Nine o’clock. I have people to answer to, and they’d be very unhappy with me if I gave you time to build an alibi.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Come to the house. I’ll send Jeanne out to a movie with her girlfriends.”</p><p class="calibre13">“I have another place in mind. And you won’t need directions to find it.” I told him what I had in mind.</p><p class="calibre13">“Why there?” He sounded honestly puzzled.</p><p class="calibre13">“Just come. And if you don’t want the Duvaliers <span class="italic">père</span> and <span class="italic">fils</span> very angry at you, my friend, come alone.”</p><p class="calibre13">I hung up.</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">3</span></span></p><p class="calibre21">I was back at the hospital at six on the dot, and visited with Sadie for half an hour. Her head was clear again, and she claimed her pain wasn’t too bad. At six-thirty I kissed her good cheek and told her I had to go.</p><p class="calibre13">“Your business?” she asked. “Your real business?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Yes.”</p><p class="calibre13">“No one gets hurt unless it’s absolutely necessary. Right?”</p><p class="calibre13">I nodded. “And never by mistake.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Be careful.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Like walking on eggs.”</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">She tried to smile. It turned into a wince as the freshly flayed left side of her face pulled against itself. Her eyes looked over my shoulder. I turned to see Deke and Ellie in the doorway. They had dressed in their best, Deke in a summer-weight suit, string tie, and town cowboy hat, Ellie in a pink silk dress.</p><p class="calibre13">“We can wait, if you want us to,” Ellie said.</p><p class="calibre13">“No, come on in. I was just leaving. But don’t stay long, she’s tired.”</p><p class="calibre13">I kissed Sadie twice—dry lips and moist forehead. Then I drove back to West Neely Street, where I spread out the items I’d bought at the costume and novelty shop. I worked slowly and carefully in front of the bathroom mirror, referring often to the directions and wishing Sadie were here to help me.</p><p class="calibre13">I wasn’t worried that de Mohrenschildt would take a look at me and say <span class="italic">haven’t I seen you before;</span> what I wanted to make sure of was that he wouldn’t recognize “John Lennon” later on. Depending on how believable he was, I might have to come back on him. If so, I’d want to take him by surprise.</p><p class="calibre13">I glued on the mustache first. It was a bushy one, making me look like an outlaw in a John Ford western. Next came the makeup, which I used on my face and hands to give myself a rancher’s tan. There were horn-rimmed specs with plain glass lenses. I had briefly considered dying my hair, but that would have created a parallel with John Clayton that I couldn’t have faced. Instead I yanked on a San Antonio Bullets baseball cap. When I was finished, I hardly recognized myself in the mirror.</p><p class="calibre13">“Nobody gets hurt unless it absolutely has to happen,” I told the stranger in the mirror. “And never by mistake. Have we got that straight?”</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">The stranger nodded, but the eyes behind the fake glasses were cool.</p><p class="calibre13">The last thing I did before leaving was to take my revolver from the closet shelf and shove it in my pocket.</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">4</span></span></p><p class="calibre21">I got to the deserted parking lot at the end of Mercedes Street twenty minutes early, but de Mohrenschildt was already there, his gaudy Cadillac butted up against the brick backside of the Montgomery Ward warehouse. That meant he was anxious. Excellent.</p><p class="calibre13">I looked around, almost expecting to see the jump-rope girls, but of course they were in for the night—possibly sleeping and dreaming of Charlie Chaplin touring France, just to watch the ladies dance.</p><p class="calibre13">I parked near de Mohrenschildt’s yacht, rolled down my window, stuck out my left hand, and curled the index finger in a beckoning gesture. For a moment de Mohrenschildt sat where he was, as if unsure. Then he got out. The bigtime strut wasn’t in evidence. He looked frightened and furtive. That was also excellent. In one hand he held a file folder. From the flat look of it, there wasn’t much inside. I hoped it wasn’t just a prop. If it was, we were going to dance, and it wouldn’t be the Lindy Hop.</p><p class="calibre13">He opened the door, leaned in, and said, “Look, you’re not going to shoot me or anything, are you?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Nope,” I said, hoping I sounded bored. “If I was from the FBI you might have to worry about that, but I’m not and you know I’m not. You’ve done business with us before.” I hoped to God Al’s notes were right about that.</p><p class="calibre13">“Is this car bugged? Are <span class="italic">you</span>?”</p><p class="calibre13">“If you’re careful about what you say, you won’t have anything to worry about, will you? Now get in.”</p><p class="calibre13">He got in and shut the door. “About those leases—”</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">“You can discuss those another time, with other people. Oil isn’t my specialty. My specialty is dealing with people who behave indiscreetly, and your relationship with Oswald has been <span class="italic">very</span> indiscreet.”</p><p class="calibre13">“I was curious, that’s all. Here’s a man who manages to defect to Russia, then <span class="italic">re</span>-defect to the United States. He’s a semi-educated hillbilly, but he’s surprisingly crafty. Also . . .” He cleared his throat. “I have a friend who wants to fuck his wife.”</p><p class="calibre13">“We know about that,” I said, thinking of Bouhe—just another George in a seemingly endless parade of them. How happy I would be to escape the echo chamber of the past. “My sole interest is making sure you had nothing to do with that botched Walker hit.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Look at this. I took it from my wife’s scrapbook.”</p><p class="calibre13">He opened the folder, removed the single page of newsprint it contained, and passed it over. I turned on the Chevy’s domelight, hoping my tan wouldn’t look like the makeup it was. On the other hand, who cared? It would strike de Mohrenschildt as just one more bit of cloak-and-dagger spookery.</p><p class="calibre13">The sheet was from the April 12 <span class="italic">Morning News.</span> I knew the feature; AROUND TOWN was probably read a lot more closely by most Dallas-ites than the world and national news. There were lots of names in boldface type and lots of pix showing men and women in evening dress. De Mohrenschildt had used red ink to circle a squib halfway down. In the accompanying photo, George and Jeanne were unmistakable. He was in a tux and flashing a grin that seemed to show as many teeth as there are keys on a piano. Jeanne was displaying an amazing amount of cleavage, which the third person at the table appeared to be inspecting closely. All three held up champagne glasses.</p><p class="calibre13">“This is <span class="italic">Friday</span>’s paper,” I said. “The Walker shooting was on Wednesday.”</p><p class="calibre13">“These Around Town items are always two days old. Because they’re about nightlife, dig? Besides . . . don’t just look at the picture, <span class="italic">read</span> it, man. It’s right there in black and white!”</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">I checked, but I knew he was telling the truth as soon as I saw the other man’s name in the newspaper’s hotcha-hotcha boldface type. The harmonic echo was as loud as a guitar amp set on reverb.</p><blockquote class="calibre24">Local oil rajah <span class="bold">George de Mohrenschildt</span> and wife <span class="bold">Jeanne</span> lifted a glass (or maybe it was a dozen!) at the<span class="bold"> Carousel Club</span> on Wednesday night, celebrating the scrump-tiddly-uptious lady’s birthday. How old? The lovebirds weren’t telling, but to us she doesn’t look a day over twenty-three (skidoo!). They were hosted by the <span class="bold">Carousel’s</span> jovial panjandrum <span class="bold">Jack Ruby</span>, who sent over a bottle o’ bubbly and then joined them for a toast. Happy birthday, <span class="bold">Jeanne</span>, and long may you wave!</blockquote><p class="calibre13">“The champagne was rotgut and I had a hangover until three the next afternoon, but it was worth it if you’re satisfied.”</p><p class="calibre13">I was. I was also fascinated. “How well do you know this guy Ruby?”</p><p class="calibre13">De Mohrenschildt sniffed—all his baronial snobbery expressed in a single quick inhale through flared nostrils. “Not well, and don’t want to. He’s a crazy little Jew who buys the police free drinks so they’ll look the other way when he uses his fists. Which he likes to do. One day his temper will get him in trouble. Jeanne likes the strippers. They get her hot.” He shrugged, as if to say who could understand women. “Now are you—” He looked down, saw the gun in my fist, and stopped talking. His eyes widened. His tongue came out and licked his lips. It made a peculiar wet slupping sound as he drew it back into his mouth.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">“Am I satisfied? Was that what you were going to ask?” I prodded him with the gun barrel and took considerable pleasure in his gasp. Killing changes a man, I tell you, it coarsens him, but in my defense, if there was ever a man who deserved a salutary scare, it was this one. Marguerite was partially responsible for what her youngest son had become, and there was plenty of responsibility for Lee himself—all those half-formed dreams of glory—but de Mohrenschildt had played a part. And was it some complicated plot hatched deep in the bowels of the CIA? No. Slumming simply amused him. So did the rage and disappointment baking up from the plugged oven of Lee’s disturbed personality.</p><p class="calibre13">“Please,” de Mohrenschildt whispered.</p><p class="calibre13">“I’m satisfied. But listen to me, you windbag: you’re never going to meet with Lee Oswald again. You’re never going to talk to him on the phone. You’re never going to mention a word of this conversation to his wife, to his mother, to George Bouhe, to any of the other émigrés. Do you understand that?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Yes. Absolutely. I was growing bored with him, anyway.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Not half as bored as I am with you. If I find out you’ve talked to Lee, I’ll kill you. <span class="italic">Capisce?</span>”</p><p class="calibre13">“Yes. And the leases . . . ?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Someone will be in touch. Now get the fuck out of my car.”</p><p class="calibre13">He did so, posthaste. When he was behind the wheel of the Caddy, I reached out again with my left hand. Instead of beckoning, this time I used my index finger to point at Mercedes Street. He went.</p><p class="calibre13">I sat where I was a little while longer, looking at the clipping, which he in his haste had forgotten to take with him. The de Mohrenschildts and Jack Ruby, glasses raised. Was it a signpost pointing toward a conspiracy, after all? The tin-hat crew who believed in things like shooters popping up from sewers and Oswald doppelgängers probably would have thought so, but I knew better. It was just another harmonic. This was the Land of Ago, where everything echoed.</p><p class="calibre13">I felt I had closed Al Templeton’s window of uncertainty to the merest draft. Oswald was going to return to Dallas on the third of October. According to Al’s notes, he would get hired as a common laborer at the Texas School Book Depository in the middle of October. Except that wasn’t going to happen, because sometime between the third and the sixteenth, I was going to end his miserable, dangerous life.</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">5</span></span></p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre21">I was allowed to spring Sadie from the hospital on the morning of August seventh. She was quiet on the ride back to Jodie. I could tell she was still in considerable pain, but she rested a companionable hand on my thigh for most of the drive. When we turned off Highway 77 at the big Denholm Lions billboard, she said: “I’m going back to school in September.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Sure?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Yes. If I could stand up in front of the whole town at the Grange, I guess I can manage it in front of a bunch of kids in the school library. Besides, I have a feeling we’re going to need the money. Unless you have some source of income I don’t know about, you’ve got to be almost broke. Thanks to me.”</p><p class="calibre13">“I should have some money coming in at the end of the month.”</p><p class="calibre13">“The fight?”</p><p class="calibre13">I nodded.</p><p class="calibre13">“Good. And I’ll only have to listen to the whispers and the giggles for a little while, anyway. Because when you go, I’m going with you.” She paused. “If it’s still what you want.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Sadie, it’s <span class="italic">all</span> I want.”</p><p class="calibre13">We turned onto Main Street. Jem Needham was just finishing his rounds in his milk truck. Bill Gavery was putting out fresh loaves of bread under cheesecloth in front of the bakery. From a passing car Jan and Dean were singing that in Surf City there were two girls for every boy.</p><p class="calibre13">“Will I like it, Jake? In your place?”</p><p class="calibre13">“I hope so, hon.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Is it very different?”</p><p class="calibre13">I smiled. “People pay more for gasoline and have more buttons to push. Otherwise, it’s about the same.”</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">6</span></span></p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre21">That hot August was as close to a honeymoon as we ever managed, and it was sweet. Any pretense that I was rooming with Deke Simmons pretty well went out the window, although I still kept my car in his driveway at night.</p><p class="calibre13">Sadie recovered quickly from the latest insult to her flesh, and although her eye sagged and her cheek was still scarred and deeply hollowed where Clayton had cut through to the inside of her mouth, there was visible improvement. Ellerton and his crew had done a good job with what they had.</p><p class="calibre13">We read books sitting side by side on her couch, with her fan blowing back our hair—<span class="italic">The Group</span> for her, <span class="italic">Jude the Obscure</span> for me. We had backyard picnics in the shade of her prized Chinese Pistache tree and drank gallons of iced coffee. Sadie began to cut back on the smokes again. We watched <span class="italic">Rawhide</span> and <span class="italic">Ben Casey</span> and <span class="italic">Route 66.</span> One night she tuned in <span class="italic">The New Adventures of Ellery Queen,</span> but I asked her to change the channel. I didn’t like mysteries, I said.</p><p class="calibre13">Before bed, I carefully smoothed ointment on her wounded face, and once we were <span class="italic">in</span> bed . . . it was good. Leave it at that.</p><p class="calibre13">One day outside the grocery store, I ran into that upstanding schoolboard member Jessica Caltrop. She said she would like to speak to me for a moment on what she called “a delicate subject.”</p><p class="calibre13">“What might that be, Miz Caltrop?” I asked. “Because I’ve got ice cream in here, and I’d like to get home with it before it melts.”</p><p class="calibre13">She gave me a chilly smile that could have kept my French vanilla firm for hours. “Would home be on Bee Tree Lane, Mr. Amberson? With the unfortunate Miss Dunhill?”</p><p class="calibre13">“And that would be your business how?”</p><p class="calibre13">The smile froze a little more deeply. “As a member of the schoolboard, I have to make sure that the morality of our faculty is spotless. If you and Miss Dunhill are living together, that is a matter of grave concern to me. Teenagers are impressionable. They imitate what they see in their elders.”</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">“You think? After fifteen years or so in the classroom, I would have said they observe adult behavior and then run the other way as fast as they can.”</p><p class="calibre13">“I’m sure we could have an illuminating discussion on how you view teenage psychology, Mr. Amberson, but that’s not why I asked to speak to you, uncomfortable as I find it.” She didn’t look a bit uncomfortable. “If you are living in sin with Miss Dunhill—”</p><p class="calibre13">“Sin,” I said. “Now there’s an interesting word. Jesus said that he without it was free to cast the first stone. Or she, I suppose. Are <span class="italic">you</span> without it, Miz Caltrop?”</p><p class="calibre13">“This discussion is not about me.”</p><p class="calibre13">“But we could make it about you. <span class="italic">I</span> could make it about you. I could, for instance, start asking around about the woods colt you dropped once upon a time.”</p><p class="calibre13">She recoiled as if slapped and took two steps back toward the brick wall of the market. I took two steps forward, my grocery bags curled in my arms.</p><p class="calibre13">“I find that repulsive and offensive. If you were still teaching, I’d—”</p><p class="calibre13">“I’m sure you would, but I’m not, so you need to listen to me very carefully. It’s my understanding that you had a kid when you were sixteen and living on Sweetwater Ranch. I don’t know if the father was one of your schoolmates, a saddle tramp, or even your own father—”</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="italic">“You’re disgusting!”</span></p><p class="calibre13">True. And sometimes it’s <span class="italic">such</span> a pleasure.</p><p class="calibre13">“I don’t care who it was, but I care about Sadie, who’s been through more pain and heartache than you’ve felt in your whole life.” Now I had her pinned against the brick wall. She was looking up at me, her eyes bright with terror. In another time and place I could have felt sorry for her. Not now. “If you say <span class="italic">one word</span> about Sadie—one word to anybody—I’ll make it my business to find out where that kid of yours is now, and I’ll spread the word from one end of this town to the other. Do you understand me?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Get out of my way! Let me pass!”</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="italic">“Do you understand me?”</span></p><p class="calibre13">“Yes! <span class="italic">Yes!</span>”</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">“Good.” I stepped back. “Live your life, Miz Caltrop. I suspect it’s been pretty gray since you were sixteen—busy, though, inspecting other people’s dirty laundry <span class="italic">does</span> keep a person busy—but you live it. And let us live ours.”</p><p class="calibre13">She sidled to her left along the brick wall, in the direction of the parking lot behind the market. Her eyes were bulging. They never left me.</p><p class="calibre13">I smiled pleasantly. “Before this discussion becomes something that never happened, I want to give you a piece of advice, little lady. It comes straight from my heart. I love her, and you do not want to fuck with a man in love. If you mess in my business—or Sadie’s—I will try my best to make you the sorriest bluenose bitch in Texas. That is my sincere promise to you.”</p><p class="calibre13">She ran for the parking lot. She did it awkwardly, like someone who hasn’t moved at a pace faster than a stately walk in a long time. In her brown shin-length skirt, opaque flesh-toned hose, and sensible brown shoes, she was the spirit of the age. Her hair was coming loose from its bun. Once I had no doubt she had worn it down, the way men like to see a woman’s hair, but that had been a long time ago.</p><p class="calibre13">“And have a nice day!” I called after her.</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">7</span></span></p><p class="calibre21">Sadie came into the kitchen while I was putting things away in the icebox. “You were gone a long time. I was starting to worry.”</p><p class="calibre13">“I got talking. You know how it is in Jodie. Always someone to pass the time of day with.”</p><p class="calibre13">She smiled. The smile was coming a little more easily now. “You’re a sweet guy.”</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">I thanked Sadie and told her she was a sweet gal. I wondered if Caltrop would talk to Fred Miller, the other schoolboard member who saw himself as a guardian of town morality. I didn’t think so. It wasn’t just that I knew about her youthful indiscretion; I had set out to scare her. It had worked with de Mohrenschildt, and it had worked with her. Scaring people is a dirty job, but somebody has to do it.</p><p class="calibre13">Sadie crossed the kitchen and put an arm around me. “What would you say to a weekend at the Candlewood Bungalows before school starts? Just like in the old days? I suppose that’s very forward of Sadie, isn’t it?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Well now, that depends.” I took her in my arms. “Are we talking about a dirty weekend?”</p><p class="calibre13">She blushed, except for around the scar. The flesh there remained white and shiny. “Absolutely feelthy, señor<span class="italic">.</span>”</p><p class="calibre13">“The sooner the better, then.”</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">8</span></span></p><p class="calibre21">It wasn’t actually a dirty weekend, unless you believe—as the Jessica Caltrops of the world seem to—that lovemaking is dirty. It’s true that we spent a lot of it in bed. But we also spent a fair amount outside. Sadie was a tireless walker, and there was a vast open field on the flank of a hill behind the Candlewood. It was rioting with late-summer wildflowers. We spent most of Saturday afternoon there. Sadie could name some of the blooms—Spanish dagger, prickly poppy, something called yucca birdweed—but at others she could only shake her head, then bend over to smell whatever aromas there were to be smelled. We walked hand in hand, with high grass brushing against our jeans and big clouds with fluffed-out tops sailing the high Texas sky. Long shutters of light and shadow slipped across the field. There was a cool breeze that day, and no refinery smell in the air. At the top of the hill we turned and looked back. The bungalows were small and insignificant on the tree-dotted sweep of the prairie. The road was a ribbon.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">Sadie sat down, drew her knees to her chest, and clasped her arms around her shins. I sat down beside her.</p><p class="calibre13">“I want to ask you something,” she said.</p><p class="calibre13">“All right.”</p><p class="calibre13">“It’s not about the . . . you know, where you come from . . . that’s more than I want to think about just now. It’s about the man you came to stop. The one you say is going to kill the president.”</p><p class="calibre13">I considered this. “Delicate subject, hon. Do you remember me telling you that I’m close to a big machine full of sharp teeth?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Yes—”</p><p class="calibre13">“I said I wouldn’t let you stand next to me while I was fooling with it. I’ve already said more than I meant to, and probably more than I should have. Because the past doesn’t want to be changed. It fights back when you try. And the bigger the potential change, the harder it fights. I don’t want you to be hurt.”</p><p class="calibre13">“I already have been,” she said quietly.</p><p class="calibre13">“Are you asking if that was my fault?”</p><p class="calibre13">“No, honey.” She put a hand on my cheek. “No.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Well, it may have been, at least partially. There’s a thing called the butterfly effect—” There were hundreds of them fluttering on the slope before us, as if to illustrate that very fact.</p><p class="calibre13">“I know what that is,” she said. “There’s a Ray Bradbury story about it.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Really?”</p><p class="calibre13">“It’s called ‘A Sound of Thunder.’ It’s very beautiful and very disturbing. But Jake—Johnny was crazy long before you came on the scene. I <span class="italic">left</span> him long before you came on the scene. And if you hadn’t come along, some other man might have. I’m sure he wouldn’t have been as nice as you, but I wouldn’t have known that, would I? Time is a tree with many branches.”</p><p class="calibre13">“What do you want to know about the guy, Sadie?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Mostly why you don’t just call the police—anonymously, of course—and report him.”</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">I pulled a stem of grass to chew while I thought about that. The first thing to cross my mind was something de Mohrenschildt had said in the Montgomery Ward parking lot: <span class="italic">He’s a semi-educated hillbilly, but he’s surprisingly crafty.</span></p><p class="calibre13">It was a good assessment. Lee had escaped Russia when he was tired of it; he would also be crafty enough to escape the Book Depository after shooting the president in spite of the almost immediate police and Secret Service response. Of <span class="italic">course</span> it was a quick response; plenty of people were going to see exactly where the shots came from.</p><p class="calibre13">Lee would be questioned at gunpoint in the second-floor break room even before the speeding motorcade delivered the dying president to Parkland Hospital. The cop who did the questioning would recall later that the young man had been reasonable and persuasive. Once foreman Roy Truly vouched for him as an employee, the cop would let Ozzie Rabbit go and then hurry upstairs to seek the source of the gunshots. It was possible to believe that, if not for his encounter with Patrolman Tippit, Lee might not have been captured for days or weeks.</p><p class="calibre13">“Sadie, the Dallas cops are going to shock the world with their incompetence. I’d be nuts to trust them. They might not even act on an anonymous tip.”</p><p class="calibre13">“But why? Why wouldn’t they?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Right now because the guy’s not even in Texas, and he doesn’t mean to come back. He’s planning to defect to Cuba.”</p><p class="calibre13">“<span class="italic">Cuba?</span> Why in the world <span class="italic">Cuba</span>?”</p><p class="calibre13">I shook my head. “It doesn’t matter, because it’s not going to work. He’s going to return to Dallas, but not with any plan to kill the president. He doesn’t even know Kennedy’s coming to Dallas. Kennedy himself doesn’t know, because the trip hasn’t been scheduled yet.”</p><p class="calibre13">“But <span class="italic">you</span> know.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Yes.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Because in the time you come from, all this is in the history books.”</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">“The broad strokes, yes. I got the specifics from the friend who sent me here. I’ll tell you the whole story someday when this is over, but not now. Not while the machine with all those teeth is still running full tilt. The important thing is this: if the police question the guy at any point before mid-November, he’s going to sound completely innocent, because he <span class="italic">is</span> innocent.” Another of those vast cloud-shadows rolled over us, temporarily dropping the temperature by ten degrees or so. “For all I know, he may not have made up his mind entirely until the moment he pulled the trigger.”</p><p class="calibre13">“You speak as if it’s already happened,” she marveled.</p><p class="calibre13">“In my world, it has.”</p><p class="calibre13">“What’s important about mid-November?”</p><p class="calibre13">“On the sixteenth, the <span class="italic">Morning News</span> is going to tell Dallas about Kennedy’s motorcade down Main Street. L— the guy will read that and realize the cars will go right past the place where he’s working. He’s probably going to think it’s a message from God. Or maybe the ghost of Karl Marx.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Where’s he going to work?”</p><p class="calibre13">I shook my head again. That wasn’t safe for her to know. Of course, <span class="italic">none</span> of this was safe. Yet (I’ve said it before, but it bears repeating) what a relief to tell at least some of it to another person.</p><p class="calibre13">“If the police talked to him, they might at least frighten him out of doing it.”</p><p class="calibre13">She was right, but what a horrifying risk. I’d already taken a smaller one by talking to de Mohrenschildt, but de Mohrenschildt wanted those oil leases. Also, I’d done more than frighten him—I’d scared the living bejesus out of him. I thought he’d keep mum. Lee, on the other hand . . .</p><p class="calibre13">I took Sadie’s hand. “Right now I can predict where this man’s going the same way I could predict where a train is going to go, because it can’t leave the tracks. Once I step in, once I <span class="italic">meddle,</span> all bets are off.”</p><p class="calibre13">“If you talked to him yourself?”</p><p class="calibre13">A truly nightmarish image came into my mind. I saw Lee telling the cops, <span class="italic">The idea was put into my head by a man named George Amberson. If it hadn’t been for him, I never would have thought of it.</span></p><p class="calibre13">“I don’t think that would work, either.”</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">In a small voice, she asked: “Will you have to kill him?”</p><p class="calibre13">I didn’t answer. Which was an answer in itself, of course.</p><p class="calibre13">“And you really know this is going to happen.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Yes.”</p><p class="calibre13">“The way you know Tom Case is going to win that fight on the twenty-ninth.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Yes.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Even though everybody who knows boxing says Tiger’s going to murder him.”</p><p class="calibre13">I smiled. “You’ve been reading the sports pages.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Yes. I have.” She took the piece of grass from my mouth and put it in her own. “I’ve never been to a prizefight. Will you take me?”</p><p class="calibre13">“It’s not exactly live, you know. It’s on a big TV screen.”</p><p class="calibre13">“I know. Will you take me?”</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">9</span></span></p><p class="calibre21">There were plenty of good-looking women in the Dallas Auditorium on fight night, but Sadie got her fair share of admiring glances. She had made herself up carefully for the occasion, but even the most skillful makeup could only minimize the damage to her face, not completely hide it. Her dress helped matters considerably. It clung smoothly to her body line, and had a deep scoop neck.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">The brilliant stroke was a felt fedora given to her by Ellen Dockerty, when Sadie told her that I had asked her to go to the prizefight with me. The hat was an almost exact match for the one Ingrid Bergman wears in the final scene of <span class="italic">Casablanca.</span> With its insouciant slant, it set her face off perfectly . . . and of course it slanted to the left, putting a deep triangle of shadow over her bad cheek. It was better than any makeup job. When she came out of the bedroom for inspection, I told her she was absolutely gorgeous. The look of relief on her face and the excited sparkle in her eyes suggested that she knew I was doing more than trying to make her feel good.</p><p class="calibre13">There was heavy traffic coming into Dallas, and by the time we reached our seats, the third of five undercard matches was going on—a large black man and an even larger white man slowly pummeling each other while the crowd cheered. Not one but four enormous screens hung over the polished hardwood floor where the Dallas Spurs played (badly) during the basketball season. The picture was provided by multiple rear-screen projection systems, and although the colors were muddy—almost rudimentary—the images themselves were crisp. Sadie was impressed. In truth, so was I.</p><p class="calibre13">“Are you nervous?” she asked.</p><p class="calibre13">“Yes.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Even though—”</p><p class="calibre13">“Even though. When I bet on the Pirates to win the World Series back in ’60, I <span class="italic">knew.</span> Here I’m depending entirely on my friend, who got it off the internet.”</p><p class="calibre13">“What in the world is that?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Sci-fi. Like Ray Bradbury.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Oh . . . okay.” Then she put her fingers between her lips and whistled. <span class="italic">“Hey beer-man!”</span></p><p class="calibre13">The beer-man, decked out in a vest, cowboy hat, and silver-studded concho belt, sold us two bottles of Lone Star (glass, not plastic) with paper cups nestled over the necks. I gave him a buck and told him to keep the change.</p><p class="calibre13">Sadie took hers, bumped it against mine, and said: “Luck, Jake.”</p><p class="calibre13">“If I need it, I’m in one hell of a jam.”</p><p class="calibre13">She lit a cigarette, adding her smoke to the blue veil hanging around the lights. I was on her right, and from where I sat, she looked perfect.</p><p class="calibre13">I tapped her on the shoulder, and when she turned, I kissed her lightly on her parted lips. “Kid,” I said, “we’ll always have Paris.”</p><p class="calibre13">She grinned. “The one in Texas, maybe.”</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">A groan went up from the crowd. The black fighter had just knocked the white one on his ass.</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">10</span></span></p><p class="calibre21">The main bout commenced at nine-thirty. Close-ups of the fighters filled the screens, and when the camera centered on Tom Case, my heart sank. There were threads of gray in his curly black hair. His cheeks were becoming jowls. His midsection flabbed over his trunks. Worst of all, though, were his somehow bewildered eyes, which peered from puffy sacs of scar tissue. He didn’t look entirely sure about where he was. The audience of fifteen hundred or so mostly cheered—Tom Case was a hometown boy, after all—but I also heard a healthy chorus of boos. Sitting there slumped on his stool, holding the ropes with his gloved hands, he looked like he’d already lost. Dick Tiger, on the other hand, was up on his feet, shadowboxing and skipping nimbly in his black hightops.</p><p class="calibre13">Sadie leaned close to me and whispered, “This doesn’t look so good, honey.”</p><p class="calibre13">That was the understatement of the century. It looked terrible.</p><p class="calibre13">Down front (where the screen must have seemed like a looming cliff with blurred moving figures projected on it), I saw Akiva Roth squire a mink-wearing dolly in Garbo shades to a seat that would have been ringside, if the fight hadn’t been on a screen. In front of Sadie and me, a chubby man smoking a cigar turned around and said, “Who ya got, beautiful?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Case!” Sadie said bravely.</p><p class="calibre13">The chubby cigar-smoker laughed. “Well, you got a good heart, anyway. Care to put a tenspot on that?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Will you give me four-to-one? If Case knocks him out?”</p><p class="calibre13">“If <span class="italic">Case</span> knocks <span class="italic">Tiger</span> out? Lady, you’re on.” He stuck out a hand. Sadie shook it. Then she turned to me with a defiant little smile playing around the corner of her mouth that still worked.</p><p class="calibre13">“Pretty bold,” I said.</p><p class="calibre13">“Not at all,” she said. “Tiger’s going down in five. I can see the future.”</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">11</span></span></p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre21">The ring announcer, wearing a tux and a pound of hair tonic, trotted to center ring, yanked down a mike on a silver cord, and gave the fighters’ stats in a rolling carny-barker’s voice. The National Anthem played. Men yanked off their hats and put their hands over their hearts. I could feel my own heart thudding rapidly, at least a hundred and twenty beats a minute and maybe more. The auditorium was air-conditioned, but sweat was rolling down the back of my neck and humidifying my armpits.</p><p class="calibre13">A girl in a swimsuit strutted around the ring in high heels, holding up a card with a big number <span class="italic">1</span> on it.</p><p class="calibre13">The bell clanged. Tom Case shuffled into the ring with a resigned expression on his face. Dick Tiger bounded happily to meet him, feinted with his right hand, then unleashed a compact left hook that decked Case exactly twelve seconds into the fight. The crowds—the one here and the one in the Garden, two thousand miles away—let out a disgusted groan. The hand Sadie had rested on my thigh seemed to spring claws as it tensed and dug in.</p><p class="calibre13">“Tell that ten to say goo’bye to his friends, beautiful,” the chubby cigar-smoker said gleefully.</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="italic">Al, what the fuck were you thinking?</span></p><p class="calibre13">Dick Tiger retreated to his corner and stood there bouncing nonchalantly on the balls of his feet while the ref commenced the count, sweeping his right arm up and down dramatically. On three, Case stirred. On five he sat up. On seven he took a knee. And on nine he rose and lifted his gloves. The ref took the fighter’s face in his hands and asked a question. Case replied. The ref nodded, beckoned to Tiger, and stepped aside.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">The Tiger Man, perhaps anxious to get to the steak dinner waiting for him at Sardi’s, rushed in for the kill. Case didn’t try to escape him—his speed had left him behind long ago, perhaps during some tank-town fight in Moline, Illinois, or New Haven, Connecticut—but he was able to cover up . . . and clinch. He did a lot of that, resting his head on Tiger’s shoulder like a tired tango dancer and pounding his gloves weakly on Tiger’s back. The crowd began to boo. When the bell rang and Case plodded back to his stool with his head down and his gloved fists dangling, they booed louder.</p><p class="calibre13">“He stinks, beautiful,” the chubby man remarked.</p><p class="calibre13">Sadie looked at me anxiously. “What do you think?”</p><p class="calibre13">“I think he made it through the first, anyway.” What I <span class="italic">really</span> thought was that someone should stick a fork in Tom Case’s sagging butt, because to me he looked almost done.</p><p class="calibre13">The chick in the Jantzen did her thing again, this time holding up a <span class="italic">2.</span> The bell clanged. Once again Tiger bounded and Case plodded. My guy continued to move in close so he could clinch whenever possible, but I noticed he was now managing to deflect the left hook that had devastated him in the first round. Tiger worked on the older fighter’s gut with piston-like shots of his right hand, but there must have been quite a lot of muscle left under that flab, because they didn’t seem to affect Case very much. At one point, Tiger pushed Case back and gestured with both gloves in a <span class="italic">come on, come on</span> gesture. The crowd cheered. Case only stared at him, so Tiger moved in. Case immediately clinched. The crowd groaned. The bell rang.</p><p class="calibre13">“My granny could give Tiger a better show,” the cigar-smoker grumbled.</p><p class="calibre13">“Maybe,” Sadie said, lighting her third cigarette of the fight, “but he’s still on his feet, isn’t he?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Not for long, sugar. The next time one of those left hooks gets through, it’s gonna be Case closed.” He chortled.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">The third round was more clinching and shuffling, but in the fourth, Case let his guard drop slightly and Tiger hit him with a barrage of lefts and rights to the head that brought the audience to its feet, roaring. Akiva Roth’s girlfriend was with them. Mr. Roth himself retained his seat, but <span class="italic">did</span> trouble himself enough to cup his ladyfriend’s ass with a beringed right hand.</p><p class="calibre13">Case fell back against the ropes, shooting rights at Tiger, and one of those blows got through. It looked pretty feeble, but I saw sweat fly from the Tiger Man’s hair as he shook his head. There was a bewildered where-did-<span class="italic">that</span>-come-from expression on his face. Then he moved in again and went back to work. Blood began oozing from a cut beside Case’s left eye. Before Tiger could increase the damage from a trickle to a gush, the bell rang.</p><p class="calibre13">“If you hand over that ten now, beautiful,” the pudgy cigar-smoker said, “you and your boyfriend will be able to beat the traffic.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Tell you what,” Sadie said. “I’ll give you one chance to call it off and save yourself forty dollars.”</p><p class="calibre13">The pudgy cigar-smoker laughed. “Beautiful <span class="italic">and</span> a sensayuma. If that long tall helicopter you’re with treats you bad, sugar, come home with me.”</p><p class="calibre13">In Case’s corner, the trainer was working frantically on the bad eye, squeezing something from a tube and mooshing it around with the tips of his fingers. It looked like Crazy Glue to me, except I don’t think that had been invented yet. Then he slapped Case in the chops with a wet towel. The bell rang.</p><p class="calibre13">Dick Tiger bored in, jamming with his right and hooking with his left. Case dodged one left hook, and for the first time in the fight, Tiger launched a right uppercut at the older man’s head. Case managed to pull back just enough to keep from taking it full on the jaw, but it connected with his cheek. The force of it distorted his entire face into a horror-house grimace. He staggered back. Tiger came at him. The crowd was up again, bellowing for blood. We rose with them. Sadie’s hands were over her mouth.</p><p class="calibre13">Tiger had Case pinned in one of the neutral corners and was hammering him with rights and lefts. I could see Case sagging; I could see the lights in his eyes dimming. One more left hook—or that cannon-shot right—and they would go out.</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="italic">“PUT IM DOWN!”</span> the chubby cigar-smoker was screaming. <span class="italic">“PUT HIM DOWN, DICKY! KNOCK HIS BLOCK OFF!”</span></p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">Tiger hit him low, below the belt. Probably not on purpose, but the ref stepped in. While he cautioned Tiger about the low blow, I watched Case to see how he would use this temporary respite. I saw something come into his face that I recognized. I had seen Lee wearing the same expression on the day he’d been giving Marina hell about the zipper of her skirt. It had appeared when Marina had come back on him, accusing him of bringing her and the baby to a <span class="italic">peegsty</span> and then twirling her finger around her ear in a you’re-crazy gesture.</p><p class="calibre13">All at once this had stopped being just a payday to Tom Case.</p><p class="calibre13">The ref stepped aside. Tiger bored in, but this time Case stepped to meet him. What happened during the next twenty seconds was the most electrifying, terrifying thing I have ever seen as part of an audience. The two of them simply stood toe-to-toe, slugging each other in the face, the chest, the shoulders, the gut. There was no bobbing, no weaving, no fancy footwork. They were bulls in a pasture. Case’s nose broke and gushed blood. Tiger’s lower lip smashed back against his teeth and split; blood poured down both sides of his chin, making him look like a vampire after a big meal.</p><p class="calibre13">Everyone in the auditorium was on their feet and screaming. Sadie was jumping up and down. Her fedora fell off, exposing the scarred cheek. She took no notice. Nobody else did, either. On the huge screens, World War III was in full swing.</p><p class="calibre13">Case lowered his head to take one of those bazooka rights, and I saw Tiger grimace as his fist connected with hard bone. He took a step backward and Case unloaded a monster uppercut. Tiger turned his head, avoiding the worst of it, but his mouthpiece flew free and rolled across the canvas.</p><p class="calibre13">Case moved in, throwing haymaker lefts and rights. There was no artistry to them, only raw, angry power. Tiger backpedaled, tripped over his own feet, and went down. Case stood over him, seemingly unsure what to do or—perhaps—even where he was. His frantically signaling trainer caught his eye and he plodded back to his corner. The ref commenced his count.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">On four, Tiger took a knee. On six, he was on his feet. After the mandatory eight-count, the fight recommenced. I looked at the big clock in the corner of the screen and saw there were fifteen seconds left in the round.</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="italic">Not enough, it’s not enough time.</span></p><p class="calibre13">Case plodded forward. Tiger threw that devastating left hook. Case jerked his head to one side, and when the glove had flown past his face, he lashed out with his right. This time it was Dick Tiger’s face that distorted, and when he went down he didn’t get up.</p><p class="calibre13">The pudgy man looked at the tattered remains of his cigar, then threw it on the floor. “Jesus wept!”</p><p class="calibre13">“Yes!” Sadie chirruped, resetting her fedora at the proper insouciant slant. “On a stack of blueberry pancakes, and the disciples said they were the best they ever ate! Now pay up!”</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">12</span></span></p><p class="calibre21">By the time we got back to Jodie, August 29 had become August 30, but we were both too excited to sleep. We made love, then came out to the kitchen and ate pie in our underwear.</p><p class="calibre13">“Well?” I said. “What do you think?”</p><p class="calibre13">“That I never want to go to another prizefight. That was pure bloodlust. And I was up on my feet, cheering with the rest. For a few seconds—maybe even a full minute—I wanted Case to kill that dancing all-full-of-himself dandy. Then I couldn’t wait to get back here and jump into bed with you. That wasn’t about love just now, Jake. That was about <span class="italic">burning.</span>”</p><p class="calibre13">I said nothing. Sometimes there’s nothing to say.</p><p class="calibre13">She reached across the table, plucked a crumb from my chin, and popped it into my mouth. “Tell me it’s not hate.”</p><p class="calibre13">“What’s not?”</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">“The reason you feel you have to stop this man on your own.” She saw me start to open my mouth and held up a hand to stop me. “I heard everything you said, all your reasons, but you have to tell me they <span class="italic">are</span> reasons, and not just what I saw in that man Case’s eyes when Tiger hit him in the trunks. I can love you if you’re a man, and I can love you if you’re a hero—I guess, although for some reason that seems a lot harder—but I don’t think I can love a vigilante.”</p><p class="calibre13">I thought of how Lee looked at his wife when he wasn’t mad at her. I thought about the conversation I’d overheard when he and his little girl were splashing in the bath. I thought about his tears outside the bus station, when he’d held Junie and nuzzled beneath her chin before rolling off to New Orleans.</p><p class="calibre13">“It’s not hate,” I said. “What I feel about him is . . .”</p><p class="calibre13">I trailed off. She watched me.</p><p class="calibre13">“Sorrow for a spoiled life. But you can feel sorry for a good dog that goes rabid, too. That doesn’t stop you from putting him down.”</p><p class="calibre13">She looked me in the eyes. “I want you again. But this time it should be for love, you know? Not because we just saw two men beat the hell out of each other and our guy won.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Okay,” I said. “Okay. That’s good.”</p><p class="calibre13">And it was.</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">13</span></span></p><p class="calibre21">“Well look here,” said Frank Frati’s daughter when I walked into the pawnshop around noon on that Friday. “It’s the boxing swami with the New England accent.” She offered me a glittery smile, then turned her head and shouted, “<span class="italic">Da-ad!</span> It’s your Tom Case man!”</p><p class="calibre13">Frati came shuffling out. “Hello there, Mr. Amberson,” he said. “Big as life and handsome as Satan on Saturday night. I bet you’re feeling bright-eyed and bushy-tailed this fine day, aren’t you?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Sure,” I said. “Why wouldn’t I? I had a lucky hit.”</p><p class="calibre13">“I’m the one who took the hit.” He pulled a brown envelope, a little bigger than standard business-size, from the back pocket of his baggy gabardine slacks. “Two grand. Feel free to count it.”</p><p class="calibre13">“That’s all right,” I said. “I trust you.”</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">He started to pass over the envelope, then pulled it back and tapped his chin with it. His blue eyes, faded but shrewd, sized me up. “Any interest in rolling this over? Football season is coming up, as is the Series.”</p><p class="calibre13">“I don’t know jack about football, and a Dodgers-Yankees Series doesn’t interest me much. Hand it over.”</p><p class="calibre13">He did so.</p><p class="calibre13">“Pleasure doing business with you,” I said, and walked out. I could feel their eyes following me, and I had that by now very unpleasant sense of déjà vu. I couldn’t pinpoint the cause. I got into my car, hoping I would never have to return to that part of Fort Worth again. Or to Greenville Avenue in Dallas. Or place another bet with another bookie named Frati.</p><p class="calibre13">Those were my three wishes, and they all came true.</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">14</span></span></p><p class="calibre21">My next stop was 214 West Neely Street. I’d phoned the landlord and told him August was my last month. He tried to talk me out of it, telling me good tenants such as myself were hard to find. That was probably true—the police hadn’t come once on my account, and they visited the neighborhood a lot, especially on weekends—but I suspected it had more to do with too many apartments and not enough renters. Dallas was experiencing one of its periodic lows.</p><p class="calibre13">I stopped at First Corn on the way and plumped up my checking account with Frati’s two grand. That was fortunate. I realized later—much later—that if I’d had it on me when I got to Neely Street, I surely would have lost it.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">My plan was to dummy-check the four rooms for any possessions I might have left behind, paying particular attention to those mystic points of junk-attraction beneath sofa cushions, under the bed, and at the backs of bureau drawers. And of course I’d take my Police Special. I would want it to deal with Lee. I now had every intention of killing him, and as soon after he returned to Dallas as I possibly could. In the meantime, I didn’t want to leave a trace of George Amberson behind.</p><p class="calibre13">As I closed in on Neely, that sense of being stuck in time’s echo chamber was very strong. I kept thinking about the two Fratis, one with a wife named Marjorie, one with a daughter named Wanda.</p><blockquote class="calibre24">Marjorie: <span class="italic">Is that a bet in regular talk?</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre24">Wanda: <span class="italic">Is that a bet when it’s at home with its feet up?</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre24">Marjorie: <span class="italic">I’m J. Edgar Hoover, my son.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre24">Wanda: <span class="italic">I’m Chief Curry of the Dallas Police.</span></blockquote><p class="calibre13">And so what? It was the chiming, that was all. The harmony. A side effect of time-travel.</p><p class="calibre13">Nevertheless, an alarm bell began to ring far back in my head, and as I turned onto Neely Street, it moved up to the forebrain. History repeats itself, the past harmonizes, and that was what this feeling was about . . . but not <span class="italic">all</span> it was about. As I turned into the driveway of the house where Lee had laid his half-assed plan to assassinate Edwin Walker, I really listened to that alarm bell. Because now it was close. Now it was shrieking.</p><p class="calibre13">Akiva Roth at the fight, but not alone. With him had been a party-doll in Garbo sunglasses and a mink stole. August in Dallas was hardly mink weather, but the auditorium had been air-conditioned, and—as they say in my time—sometimes you just gotta signify.</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="italic">Take away the dark glasses. Take away the stole. What do you have?</span></p><p class="calibre13">For a moment as I sat there in my car, listening to the cooling engine tick and tock, I still had nothing. Then I realized that if you replaced the mink stole with a Ship N Shore blouse, you had Wanda Frati.</p><p class="calibre13">Chaz Frati of Derry had set Bill Turcotte on me. That thought had even crossed my mind . . . but I had dismissed it. Bad idea.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">Who had Frank Frati of Fort Worth set on me? Well, he had to know Akiva Roth of Faith Financial; Roth was his daughter’s boyfriend, after all.</p><p class="calibre13">Suddenly I wanted my gun, and I wanted it right away.</p><p class="calibre13">I got out of the Chevy and trotted up the porch steps, my keys in my hand. I was fumbling through them when a panel truck roared around the corner from Haines Avenue and scrunched to a stop in front of 214 with the leftside wheels up on the curb.</p><p class="calibre13">I looked around. Saw no one. The street was deserted. There’s never a bystander you can scream to for help when you want one. Let alone a cop.</p><p class="calibre13">I jammed the right key into the lock and turned it, thinking I’d lock them out—whoever <span class="italic">they</span> were—and call the cops on the phone. I was inside and smelling the hot, stale air of the deserted apartment when I remembered that there <span class="italic">was</span> no phone.</p><p class="calibre13">Big men were running across the lawn. Three of them. One had a short length of pipe that looked to be wrapped in something.</p><p class="calibre13">No, actually there were enough guys to play bridge. The fourth was Akiva Roth, and he wasn’t running. He was strolling up the walk with his hands in his pockets and a placid smile on his face.</p><p class="calibre13">I slammed the door. I twisted the thumb bolt. I had barely finished when it exploded open. I ran for the bedroom and got about halfway.</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">15</span></span></p><p class="calibre21">Two of Roth’s goons dragged me into the kitchen. The third was the one with the pipe. It was wrapped in strips of dark felt. I saw this when he laid it carefully on the table where I had eaten a good many meals. He put on yellow rawhide gloves.</p><p class="calibre13">Roth leaned in the doorway, still smiling placidly. “Eduardo Gutierrez has syphilis,” he announced. “It’s gone to his brain. He’ll be dead in eighteen months, but you know what? He don’t care. He believes he’s gonna come back as an Arab emirate, or sumshit. How ’bout that, huh?”</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">Responding to non sequiturs—at cocktail parties, on public transportation, in ticket lines at the movie theater—is dicey enough, but it’s <span class="italic">really</span> hard to know what to say when you’re being held by two men and about to receive a beating from a third. So I said nothing.</p><p class="calibre13">“The thing is, you got in his head. You won bets you weren’t supposed to win. Sometimes you lost, but Eddie G got this crazy idea that when you lost, you were losing on purpose. You know? Then you hit big on the Derby, and he decided you were, I dunno, some kind of telepathic gizmo who could see the future. Did you know he burned down your house?”</p><p class="calibre13">I said nothing.</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="italic">“Then,”</span> Roth said, “when those little wormies really started to bite his brain, he started to think you were some kind of ghoul, or devil. He put out the word all over the South, the West, the Midwest. ‘Look for this guy Amberson, and bring him down. Kill him. The guy is unnatural. I could smell it on im but I didn’t pay attention. Now look at me, sick and dying. And it’s this guy’s fault. He’s a ghoul or a devil, or sumshit.’ Crazy, you know? Toys in the attic.”</p><p class="calibre13">I said nothing.</p><p class="calibre13">“Carmo, I don’t think my friend Georgie’s listening. I think he’s dozing off. Give him a wake-up call.”</p><p class="calibre13">The man in the yellow rawhide gloves swung a Tom Case uppercut, bringing it from hip level to the left side of my face. Pain exploded in my head, and for a few moments I saw everything on that side through a scarlet haze.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">“Okay, you look a little more awake now,” Roth said. “Where was I? Oh, I know. How you turned into Eddie G’s private boogeyman. Because of the syph, we all knew that. If it hadn’t been you, it would have been some barbershop dog. Or a girl who jerked him off too hard at the drive-in when he was sixteen. Sometimes he can’t remember his own address, he has to call someone to come get him. Sad, huh? It’s those worms in his head. But everybody humors him, because Eddie was always a good guy. He could tell a joke, man, you’d laugh until you cried. Nobody even thought you were real. Then Eddie G’s boogeyman turns up in Dallas, at my shop. And what happens? The boogeyman bets on the Pirates to beat the Yankees, which everyone knows ain’t gonna happen, and in seven games, which everyone knows the Series ain’t gonna go.”</p><p class="calibre13">“It was just luck,” I said. My voice sounded furry, because the side of my mouth was swelling. “An impulse bet.”</p><p class="calibre13">“That’s just stupid, and stupidity always got to be paid for. Carmo, kneecap this stupid sonofabitch.”</p><p class="calibre13">“No!” I said. “No, please don’t do that!”</p><p class="calibre13">Carmo smiled as if I’d said something cute, plucked the felt-wrapped pipe from the table, and swung it at my left knee. I heard something down there make a popping sound. Like a big knuckle. The pain was exquisite. I bit back a scream and sagged against the men who were holding me. They yanked me back up.</p><p class="calibre13">Roth stood in the doorway, hands in pockets, smiling his happy placid smile. “Okay. Cool. That’s gonna swell, by the way. You won’t believe how big it’s gonna get. But hey, you bought it, you paid for it, you own it. Meanwhile, the facts, ma’am, nothing but the facts.” The goons holding me laughed.</p><p class="calibre13">“The facts are nobody dressed like you was on the day you came into my store makes a bet like that. For a man dressed like you was, an impulse bet is ten dollars, a double sawbuck at most. But the Pirates came through, that is also the facts. And I’m starting to think Eddie G might be right. Not that you’re a devil or a ghoul or an ESP gizmo, nothing like that, but how about maybe you know somebody who knows something? Like the fix is in and the Pirates are <span class="italic">supposed</span> to win in seven?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Nobody fixes baseball, Roth. Not since the Black Sox in 1919. You run a book, you must know that.”</p><p class="calibre13">He raised his eyebrows. “You know my name! Hey, maybe you <span class="italic">are</span> an ESP guy. But I ain’t got all day.”</p><p class="calibre13">He glanced at his watch, as if to confirm this. It was big and clunky, probably a Rolex.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">“I try to see where you live when you come in to collect, but you hold your thumb over your address. That’s okay. Lotta guys do that. I decide I’m gonna let it go. I should send some boys down the street to beat the shit out of you, maybe even kill you so that Eddie G’s mind—what’s left of it—can be at rest? Because some guy took shit odds and beat me out of twelve hundred? Fuck that, what Eddie G don’t know won’t hurt him. Besides, with you out of the way, he’d just start thinking about something else. Maybe that Henry Ford was the Annie Christ or sumshit. Carmo, he’s not listening again and <span class="italic">that pisses me off.</span>”</p><p class="calibre13">Carmo swung the pipe at my midsection. It struck me below the ribs with paralyzing force. There was pain, first jagged, then swallowed in a growing explosion of heat, like a fireball.</p><p class="calibre13">“Hurts, don’t it?” Carmo said. “Gets you right in the old kazeenie.”</p><p class="calibre13">“I think you ruptured something,” I said. I heard a hoarse steam-engine sound and realized that was me, panting.</p><p class="calibre13">“I hope he fucking <span class="italic">did,</span>” Roth said. “I let you <span class="italic">go,</span> you dumbbell! I fucking let you <span class="italic">go</span>! I <span class="italic">forgot</span> about you! Then you turn up at Frank’s in Fort Worth to bet the goddam Case-Tiger fight. Exact same MO—big bet on the underdog and all the odds you can get. This time you predict the <span class="italic">exact fucking round.</span> So here’s what’s going to happen, my friend: you’re going to tell me how you knew. If you do that, I take some pictures of you like you are now and Eddie G’s satisfied. He knows he can’t have you dead, because Carlos told him no, and Carlos is the one guy he listens to, even now. But if he sees you fucked up . . . aw, but you ain’t fucked up enough quite yet. Fuck him up some more, Carmo. Do the face.”</p><p class="calibre13">So Carmo hammered my face while the other two held me. He broke my nose, closed my left eye, knocked out a few teeth, and tore open my left cheek. I kept thinking, <span class="italic">I’ll pass out or they’ll kill me, either way the pain will stop.</span> But I didn’t pass out, and at some point Carmo quit. He was breathing hard, and there were red splotches on his yellow rawhide gloves. Sunshine came in through the kitchen windows and made cheery oblongs on the faded linoleum.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">“That’s better,” Roth said. “Get the Polaroid out of the truck, Carmo. Hustle, now. I want to finish up here.”</p><p class="calibre13">Before leaving, Carmo stripped off his gloves and put them on the table next to the lead pipe. Some of the felt strips had come loose. They were soaked with blood. My face was throbbing, but my abdomen was worse. There, the heat continued to spread. Something was very wrong down there.</p><p class="calibre13">“One more time, Amberson. How’d you know the fix was in? Who told you? The truth.”</p><p class="calibre13">“It was just a guess.” I tried to tell myself I sounded like a man with a bad cold, but I didn’t. I sounded like a man who’d just had the shit beaten out of him.</p><p class="calibre13">He picked up the pipe and tapped it against one pudgy hand. “Who told you, fuckface?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Nobody. Gutierrez was right. I’m a devil, and devils can see the future.”</p><p class="calibre13">“You’re running out of chances.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Wanda’s too tall for you, Roth. And too skinny. When you’re on top of her, you must look like a toad trying to fuck a log. Or maybe—”</p><p class="calibre13">His placid face wrinkled into rage. It was a complete transformation, and it happened in less than a second. He swung the pipe at my head. I got my left arm up and heard it crack like a birch-branch overloaded with ice. This time when I sagged, the goons let me drop to the floor.</p><p class="calibre13">“Fuckin wiseass, how I hate a fuckin wiseass.” This seemed to come from a great distance. Or a great height. Or both. I was finally getting ready to pass out, and ever so grateful to go. But I had enough vision left to see Carmo when he came back in with a Polaroid camera. It was big and bulky, the kind where the lens comes out on a kind of accordion.</p><p class="calibre13">“Turn im over,” Roth said. “Let’s get his good side.” As the goons did so, Carmo handed Roth the camera, and Roth handed Carmo the pipe. Then Roth raised the camera to his face and said, “Watch the birdie, you fuckin spunkbucket. Here’s one for Eddie G . . .”</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="italic">Flash.</span></p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">“. . . and one for my own personal collection, which I don’t actually have but which I may now start . . .”</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="italic">Flash.</span></p><p class="calibre13">“. . . and here’s one for you. To remember that when serious people ask you questions, you should answer.”</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="italic">Flash.</span></p><p class="calibre13">He yanked the third shot out of the camera and threw it in my direction. It landed in front of my left hand . . . which he then stepped on. Bones crunched. I whimpered and drew my hurt hand back to my chest. He had broken at least one finger, maybe as many as three.</p><p class="calibre13">“You want to remember to strip that in sixty seconds, or it’ll get all overcooked. If you’re awake, that is.”</p><p class="calibre13">“You want to ask im some more now that he’s tenderized?” Carmo asked.</p><p class="calibre13">“You kiddin? Look at im. He don’t even know his own name anymore. Fuck him.” He started to turn away, then turned back. “Hey, asshat. Here’s one to grow on.”</p><p class="calibre13">That was when he kicked me in the side of the head with what felt like a steel-toed shoe. Skyrockets exploded across my vision. Then the back of my head connected with the baseboard, and I was gone.</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">16</span></span></p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre21">I don’t think I was out for long, because the oblongs of sunlight on the linoleum didn’t appear to have moved. My mouth tasted of wet copper. I spat half-congealed blood onto the floor, along with a fragment of tooth, and set about getting to my feet. I needed to hold onto one of the kitchen chairs with my one working hand, then onto the table (which nearly fell over on top of me), but on the whole it was easier than I thought. My left leg felt numb, and my pants were tight halfway down, where the knee was swelling as promised, but I thought it could have been a lot worse.</p><p class="calibre13">I looked out the window to make sure the panel truck was gone, then began a slow, limping journey into the bedroom. My heart was taking big soft walloping beats in my chest. Each one throbbed in my broken nose and vibrated the swelling left side of my face, where the cheekbone just about had to be broken. The back of my head throbbed, too. My neck was stiff.</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="italic">Could have been worse,</span> I reminded myself as I shuffled across the bedroom. <span class="italic">You’re on your feet, aren’t you? Just get the damn gun, put it in the glove compartment, then drive yourself to the emergency room. You’re basically all right. Probably better than Dick Tiger is this morning.</span></p><p class="calibre13">I was able to go on telling myself that until I stretched my hand up to the closet shelf. When I did that, something first pulled in my guts . . . and then seemed to <span class="italic">roll.</span> The sullen heat centered on my left side flared like coals when you throw gasoline on them. I got my fingertips on the butt of the gun, turned it, hooked a thumb into the trigger-guard, and pulled it off the shelf. It hit the floor and bounced into the bedroom.</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="italic">Probably not even loaded.</span> I bent over to get it. My left knee shrieked and gave way. I fell to the floor, and the pain in my guts whooshed up again. I got the gun, though, and rolled the cylinder. It was loaded after all. Every chamber. I put it in my pocket and tried to crawl back to the kitchen, but the knee was too painful. And the headache was worse, spreading out dark tentacles from its little cave above the nape of my neck.</p><p class="calibre13">I made it to the bed on my belly, using a swimming motion. Once I was there I managed to haul myself up again, using my right arm and right leg. The left leg held me, but I was losing flexion in the knee. I had to get out of there, and right away.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">I must have looked like Chester, the limping deputy from <span class="italic">Gunsmoke,</span> as I made my way out of the bedroom, across the kitchen, and to the front door, which hung open with splinters around the lock. I even remember thinking <span class="italic">Mr. Dillon, Mr. Dillon, there’s trouble down at the Longbranch!</span></p><p class="calibre13">I crossed the porch, seized the railing in my right fist, and crabbed down to the walk. There were only four steps, but my headache got worse each time I jolted down another one. I seemed to be losing my peripheral vision, which couldn’t be good. I tried to turn my head to see my Chevrolet, but my neck didn’t want to cooperate. I managed a shuffling whole-body pivot instead, and when I had the car in my sights, I realized driving would be an impossibility. Even opening the passenger side door and stowing the gun in the glove compartment would be an impossibility: bending would cause the pain and heat in my side to explode again.</p><p class="calibre13">I fumbled the .38 out of my pocket and returned to the porch. I held the stair-rail and underhanded the gun beneath the steps. It would have to do. I straightened up again and made my slow way down the walk to the street. <span class="italic">Baby steps,</span> I told myself. <span class="italic">Little baby steps.</span></p><p class="calibre13">Two kids came sailing up on bikes. I tried to tell them I needed help, but the only thing to come out of my swollen mouth was a dry <span class="italic">hhhahhhh</span> sound. They glanced at each other, then pedaled faster and swerved around me.</p><p class="calibre13">I turned to the right (my swollen knee made going left seem like the world’s worst idea) and began to stagger down the sidewalk. My vision continued to close in; now I seemed to be peering out of a gunslit, or from the mouth of a tunnel. For a moment that made me think of the fallen smokestack at the Kitchener Ironworks, back in Derry.</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="italic">Get to Haines Avenue,</span> I told myself. <span class="italic">There’ll be traffic on Haines Avenue. You have to get at least that far.</span></p><p class="calibre13">But was I going toward Haines, or away from it? I couldn’t remember. The visible world was down to a single sharp circle about six inches in diameter. My head was splitting; there was a forest fire in my guts. When I fell, it seemed to be in slow motion, and the sidewalk felt as soft as a feather-pillow.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">Before I could pass out, something prodded me. A hard, metallic something. A rusty voice eight or ten miles above me said, “You! <span class="italic">You,</span> boy! What’s wrong with you?”</p><p class="calibre13">I turned over. It took the last of my strength, but I managed. Towering above me was the elderly woman who’d called me a coward when I refused to step in between Lee and Marina on The Day of the Zipper. It might have <span class="italic">been</span> that day, because, August heat or no August heat, she was once more wearing the pink flannel nightgown and the quilted jacket. Perhaps because I still had boxing on what remained of my mind, her upstanding hair today reminded me of Don King instead of Elsa Lanchester. She had poked me with one of the front legs of her walker.</p><p class="calibre13">“Ohmydeargod,” she said. “Who has beaten you?”</p><p class="calibre13">That was a long story, and I couldn’t tell it. The dark was closing in, and I was glad because the pain in my head was killing me. <span class="italic">Al got lung cancer,</span> I thought. <span class="italic">I got Akiva Roth. Either way, game over. Ozzie wins.</span></p><p class="calibre13">Not if I could help it.</p><p class="calibre13">Gathering all my strength, I spoke to the face far above me, the only bright thing left in the encroaching darkness. “Call . . . nine-one-one.”</p><p class="calibre13">“What’s <span class="italic">that</span>?”</p><p class="calibre13">Of course she didn’t know. Nine-one-one hadn’t been invented yet. I held on long enough to try one more time. “Ambulance.”</p><p class="calibre13">I think I might have repeated it, but I’m not sure. That was when the darkness swallowed me.</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">17</span></span></p><p class="calibre21">I have wondered since if it was kids who stole my car, or Roth’s goons. And when it happened. At any rate, the thieves didn’t trash it or crash it; Deke Simmons picked it up in the DPD impound lot a week later. It was in far better shape than I was.</p><p class="calibre13">Time-travel is full of ironies.</p><div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_41"></div></body>
