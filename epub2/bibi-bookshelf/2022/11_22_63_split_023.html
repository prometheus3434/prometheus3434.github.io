I once more rapped on the trunk of the white-over-red Plymouth Fury as I went by. For good luck, I guess. In the weeks, months, and years to come, I was going to need all the good luck I could get.</p><p class="calibre13">This time I didn’t visit the Kennebec Fruit, and I had no intention of shopping for clothes or a car. Tomorrow or the next day would do for that, but today might be a bad day to be a stranger in The Falls. Very shortly someone was going to find a dead body in the millyard, and a stranger might be questioned. George Amberson’s ID wouldn’t stand up to that, especially when his driver’s license was for a house on Bluebird Lane that hadn’t been built yet.</p><p class="calibre13">I made it to the millworkers’ bus stop outside the parking lot just as the bus with LEWISTON EXPRESS in its destination window came snoring along. I got on and handed over the dollar bill I’d meant to give to the Yellow Card Man. The driver clicked a handful of silver out of the chrome change-maker he wore on his belt. I dropped fifteen cents into the fare box and made my way down the swaying aisle to a seat near the back, behind two pimply sailors—probably from the Brunswick Naval Air Station—who were talking about the girls they hoped to see at a strip joint called the Holly. Their conversation was punctuated by an exchange of hefty shoulder-punches and a great deal of snorkeling laughter.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">I watched Route 196 unroll almost without seeing it. I kept thinking about the dead man. And the card, which was now dead black. I’d wanted to put distance between myself and that troubling corpse as quickly as possible, but I had paused long enough to touch the card. It wasn’t cardboard, as I had first assumed. Not plastic, either. Celluloid, maybe . . . except it hadn’t exactly felt like that, either. What it felt like was dead skin—the kind you might pare off a callus. There had been no writing on it, at least none that I could see.</p><p class="calibre13">Al had assumed the Yellow Card Man was just a wet-brain who’d been driven crazy by an unlucky combination of booze and proximity to the rabbit-hole. I hadn’t questioned that until the card turned orange. Now I more than questioned it; I flat-out didn’t believe it. What <span class="italic">was</span> he, anyway?</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="italic">Dead, that’s what he is. And that’s all he is. So let it go. You’ve got a lot to do.</span></p><p class="calibre13">When we passed the Lisbon Drive-In, I yanked the stop-cord. The driver pulled over at the next white-painted telephone pole.</p><p class="calibre13">“Have a nice day,” I told him as he pulled the lever that flopped the doors open.</p><p class="calibre13">“Ain’t nothin nice about this run except a cold beer at quittin time,” he said, and lit a cigarette.</p><p class="calibre13">A few seconds later I was standing on the gravel shoulder of the highway with my briefcase dangling from my left hand, watching the bus lumber off toward Lewiston, trailing a cloud of exhaust. On the back was an ad-card showing a housewife who held a gleaming pot in one hand and an S.O.S. Magic Scouring Pad in the other. Her huge blue eyes and toothy red-lipsticked grin suggested a woman who might be only minutes away from a catastrophic mental breakdown.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">The sky was cloudless. Crickets sang in the high grass. Somewhere a cow lowed. With the diesel stink of the bus whisked away by a light breeze, the air smelled sweet and fresh and new. I started trudging the quarter mile or so to the Tamarack Motor Court. Just a short walk, but before I got to my destination, two people pulled over and asked me if I wanted a ride. I thanked them and said I was fine. And I was. By the time I reached the Tamarack I was whistling.</p><p class="calibre13">September of ’58, United States of America.</p><p class="calibre13">Yellow Card Man or no Yellow Card Man, it was good to be back.</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">2</span></span></p><p class="calibre21">I spent the rest of that day in my room, going over Al’s Oswald notes for the umpteenth time, this time paying special attention to the two pages at the end marked <span class="italic">CONCLUSIONS ON HOW TO PROCEDE.</span> Trying to watch the TV, which essentially got just one channel, was an exercise in absurdity, so when dusk came I ambled down to the drive-in and paid a special walk-in price of thirty cents. There were folding chairs set up in front of the snackbar. I bought a bag of popcorn plus a tasty cinnamon-flavored soft drink called Pepsol, and watched <span class="italic">The Long, Hot Summer</span> with several other walk-ins, mostly elderly people who knew each other and chatted companionably. The air had turned chilly by the time <span class="italic">Vertigo</span> started, and I had no jacket. I walked back to the motor court and slept soundly.</p><p class="calibre13">The next morning I took the bus back to Lisbon Falls (no cabs; I considered myself on a budget, at least for the time being), and made the Jolly White Elephant my first stop. It was early, and still cool, so the beatnik was inside, sitting on a ratty couch and reading <span class="italic">Argosy.</span></p><p class="calibre13">“Hi, neighbor,” he said.</p><p class="calibre13">“Hi yourself. I guess you sell suitcases?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Oh, I got a few in stock. No more’n two-three hundred. Walk all the way to the back—”</p><p class="calibre13">“And look on the right,” I said.</p><p class="calibre13">“That’s right. Have you been here before?”</p><p class="calibre13">“We’ve <span class="italic">all</span> been here before,” I said. “This thing is bigger than pro football.”</p><p class="calibre13">He laughed. “Groovy, Jackson. Go pick yourself a winner.”</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">I picked the same leather valise. Then I went across the street and bought the Sunliner again. This time I bargained harder and got it for three hundred. When the dickering was done, Bill Titus sent me over to his daughter.</p><p class="calibre13">“You don’t sound like you’re from around here,” she said.</p><p class="calibre13">“Wisconsin originally, but I’ve been in Maine for quite awhile. Business.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Guess you weren’t around The Falls yesterday, huh?” When I said I hadn’t been, she popped her gum and said: “You missed some excitement. They found an old boozer dead outside the drying shed over at the mill.” She lowered her voice. “Suicide. Cut his own throat with a piece of glass. Can you imagine?”</p><p class="calibre13">“That’s awful,” I said, tucking the Sunliner’s bill of sale into my wallet. I bounced the car keys on my palm. “Local guy?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Nope, and no ID. He probably came down from The County in a boxcar, that’s what my dad says. For the apple picking over in Castle Rock, maybe. Mr. Cady—he’s the clerk at the greenfront—told my dad the guy came in yesterday morning and tried to buy a pint, but he was drunk and smelly, so Mr. Cady kicked him out. Then he must have went over to the millyard to drink up whatever he had left, and when it was gone, he broke the bottle and cut his throat with one of the pieces.” She repeated: “Can you <span class="italic">imagine</span>?”</p><p class="calibre13">I skipped the haircut, and I skipped the bank, too, but I once more bought clothes at Mason’s Menswear.</p><p class="calibre13">“You must like that shade of blue,” the clerk commented, and held up the shirt on top of my pile. “Same color as the one you’re wearing.”</p><p class="calibre13">In fact it <span class="italic">was</span> the shirt I was wearing, but I didn’t say so. It would only have confused us both.</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">3</span></span></p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre21">I drove up the Mile-A-Minute Highway that Thursday afternoon. This time I didn’t need to buy a hat when I got to Derry, because I’d remembered to add a nice summer straw to the purchases I made at Mason’s. I registered at the Derry Town House, had a meal in the dining room, then went into the bar and ordered a beer from Fred Toomey. On this go-round I made no effort to engage him in conversation.</p><p class="calibre13">The following day I rented my old apartment on Harris Avenue, and far from keeping me awake, the sound of the descending planes actually lulled me to sleep. The day after that, I went down to Machen’s Sporting Goods and told the clerk I was interested in buying a handgun because I was in the real estate business and blah blah blah. The clerk brought out my .38 Police Special and once more told me it was a fine piece of protection. I bought it and put it in my briefcase. I thought about walking out Kansas Street to the little picnic area so I could watch Richie-from-the-ditchie and Bevvie-from-the-levee practice their Jump Street moves, then realized I’d missed them. I wished I’d thought to check the late November issues of the <span class="italic">Daily News</span> during my brief return to 2011; I could have found out if they’d won their talent show.</p><p class="calibre13">I made it a habit to drop into The Lamplighter for an early-evening beer, before the place started to fill up. Sometimes I ordered Lobster Pickin’s. I never saw Frank Dunning there, nor wanted to. I had another reason for making The Lamplighter a regular stop. If all went well, I’d soon be heading for Texas, and I wanted to build up my personal treasury before I went. I made friends with Jeff the bartender, and one evening toward the end of September, he brought up a subject I’d been planning to raise myself.</p><p class="calibre13">“Who do you like in the Series, George?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Yankees, of course,” I said.</p><p class="calibre13">“You say that? A guy from <span class="italic">Wisconsin</span>?”</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">“Home-state pride has nothing to do with it. The Yankees are a team of destiny this year.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Never happen. Their pitchers are old. Their defense is leaky. Mantle’s got bad wheels. The Bronx Bomber dynasty is over. Milwaukee might even sweep.”</p><p class="calibre13">I laughed. “You make a few good points, Jeff, I can see you’re a student of the game, but ’fess up—you hate the Yanks just like everybody else in New England, and it’s destroyed your perspective.”</p><p class="calibre13">“You want to put your money where your mouth is?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Sure. A fin. I make it a point not to take any more than a five-spot from the wage-slaves. Are we on?”</p><p class="calibre13">“We are.” And we shook on it.</p><p class="calibre13">“Okay,” I said, “now that we’ve got that accomplished, and since we’re on the subjects of baseball and betting—the two great American pastimes—I wonder if you could tell me where I could find some serious action in this town. If I may wax poetic, I want to lay a major wager. Bring me another beer and draw one for yourself.”</p><p class="calibre13">I said <span class="italic">major wager</span> Maine-style—<span class="italic">majah wajah</span>—and he laughed as he drew a couple of Narragansetts (which I had learned to call Nasty Gansett; when in Rome, one should, as much as possible, speak as the Romans do).</p><p class="calibre13">We clinked glasses, and Jeff asked me what I meant by serious action. I pretended to consider, then told him.</p><p class="calibre13">“Five hundred smacks? On the <span class="italic">Yankees</span>? When the Braves’ve got Spahn and Burdette? Not to mention Hank Aaron and Steady Eddie Mathews? You’re nuts.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Maybe yes, maybe no. We’ll see starting October first, won’t we? <span class="italic">Is</span> there anyone in Derry who’ll fade a bet of that size?”</p><p class="calibre13">Did I know what he was going to say next? No. I’m not that prescient. Was I surprised? No again. Because the past isn’t just obdurate; it’s in harmony with both itself and the future. I experienced that harmony time and again.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">“Chaz Frati. You’ve probably seen him in here. He owns a bunch of hockshops. I wouldn’t exactly call him a bookie, but he keeps plenty busy at World Series time and during high school football and basketball season.”</p><p class="calibre13">“And you think he’ll take my action.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Sure. Give you odds and everything. Just . . .” He looked around, saw we still had the bar to ourselves, but dropped his voice to a whisper anyway. “Just don’t stiff him, George. He knows people. <span class="italic">Strong</span> people.”</p><p class="calibre13">“I hear you,” I said. “Thanks for the tip. In fact, I’m going to do you a favor and not hold you to that five when the Yankees win the Series.”</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">4</span></span></p><p class="calibre21">The following day I entered Chaz Frati’s Mermaid Pawn &amp; Loan, where I was confronted by a large, stone-faced lady of perhaps three hundred pounds. She wore a purple dress, Indian beads, and moccasins on her swollen feet. I told her I was interested in discussing a rather large sports-oriented business proposal with Mr. Frati.</p><p class="calibre13">“Is that a bet in regular talk?” she asked.</p><p class="calibre13">“Are you a cop?” I asked.</p><p class="calibre13">“Yes,” she said, bringing a Tiparillo out of one dress pocket and lighting it with a Zippo. “I’m J. Edgar Hoover, my son.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Well, Mr. Hoover, you got me. I’m talking about a bet.”</p><p class="calibre13">“World Series or Tigers football?”</p><p class="calibre13">“I’m not from town, and wouldn’t know a Derry Tiger from a Bangor Baboon. It’s baseball.”</p><p class="calibre13">The woman stuck her head through a curtained-off doorway at the back of the room, presenting me with what was surely one of central Maine’s largest backsides, and hollered, “Hey Chazzy, come out here. You got a live one.”</p><p class="calibre13">Frati came out and kissed the large lady on the cheek. “Thank you, my love.” His sleeves were rolled up, and I could see the mermaid. “May I help you?”</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">“I hope so. George Amberson’s the name.” I offered my hand. “I’m from Wisconsin, and although my heart’s with the hometown boys, when it comes to the Series my wallet’s with the Yankees.”</p><p class="calibre13">He turned to the shelf behind him, but the large lady already had what he wanted—a scuffed green ledger with PERSONAL LOANS on the front. He opened it and paged to a blank sheet, periodically wetting the tip of his finger. “How much of your wallet are we talking about, cuz?”</p><p class="calibre13">“What kind of odds could I get on five hundred to win?”</p><p class="calibre13">The fat woman laughed and blew out smoke.</p><p class="calibre13">“On the Bombers? Even-up, cuz. Strictly even-up.”</p><p class="calibre13">“What kind of odds could I get on five hundred, Yankees in seven?”</p><p class="calibre13">He considered, then turned to the large lady. She shook her head, still looking amused. “Won’t go,” she said. “If you don’t believe me, send a telegram and check the line in New York.”</p><p class="calibre13">I sighed and drummed my fingers on a glass case filled with watches and rings. “Okay, how about this—five hundred and the Yankees come back from three games to one.”</p><p class="calibre13">He laughed. “Some sensayuma, cuz. Just let me consult with the boss.”</p><p class="calibre13">He and the large lady (Frati looked like a Tolkien dwarf next to her) consulted in whispers, then he came back to the counter. “If you mean what I think you mean, I’ll take your action at four-to-one. But if the Yankees don’t go down three-to-one and then bounce all the way back, you lose the bundle. I just like to get the terms of the wager straight.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Straight as can be,” I said. “And—no offense to either you or your friend—”</p><p class="calibre13">“We’re married,” the large lady said, “so don’t call us friends.” And she laughed some more.</p><p class="calibre13">“No offense to either you or your wife, but four-to-one doesn’t make it. <span class="italic">Eight</span>-to-one, though . . . then it’s a nice piece of action for both sides.”</p><p class="calibre13">“I’ll give you five-to-one, but that’s where it stops,” Frati said. “For me this is just a sideline. You want Vegas, go to Vegas.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Seven,” I said. “Come on, Mr. Frati, work with me on this.”</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">He and the large lady conferred. Then he came back and offered six-to-one, which I accepted. It was still low odds for such a crazy bet, but I didn’t want to hurt Frati too badly. It was true that he’d set me up for Bill Turcotte, but he’d had his reasons.</p><p class="calibre13">Besides, that was in another life.</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">5</span></span></p><p class="calibre21">Back then, baseball was played as it was meant to be played—in bright afternoon sunshine, and on days in the early fall when it still felt like summer. People gathered in front of Benton’s Appliance Store down in the Low Town to watch the games on three twenty-one-inch Zeniths perched on pedestals in the show window. Above them was a sign reading WHY WATCH ON THE STREET WHEN YOU CAN WATCH AT HOME? <span class="italic">EASY CREDIT TERMS!</span></p><p class="calibre13">Ah, yes. Easy credit terms. That was more like the America I had grown up in.</p><p class="calibre13">On October first, Milwaukee beat the Yankees one to nothing, behind Warren Spahn. On October second, Milwaukee buried the Bombers, thirteen to five. On the fourth of October, when the Series returned to the Bronx, Don Larsen blanked Milwaukee four-zip, with relief help from Ryne Duren, who had no idea where the ball was going once it left his hand, and consequently scared the living shit out of the batters who had to face him. The perfect closer, in other words.</p><p class="calibre13">I listened to the first part of that game on the radio in my apartment, and watched the last couple of innings with the crowd gathered in front of Benton’s. When it was over, I went into the drugstore and purchased Kaopectate (probably the same giant economy size bottle as on my last trip). Mr. Keene once more asked me if I was suffering a touch of the bug. When I told him that I felt fine, the old bastard looked disappointed. I <span class="italic">did</span> feel fine, and I didn’t expect that the past would throw me exactly the same Ryne Duren fastballs, but I felt it best to be prepared.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">On my way out of the drugstore, my eye was attracted by a display with a sign over it that read TAKE HOME A LITTLE BIT O’ MAINE! There were postcards, inflatable toy lobsters, sweet-smelling bags of soft pine duff, replicas of the town’s Paul Bunyan statue, and small decorative pillows with the Derry Standpipe on them—the Standpipe being a circular tower that held the town’s drinking water. I bought one of these.</p><p class="calibre13">“For my nephew in Oklahoma City,” I told Mr. Keene.</p><p class="calibre13">The Yankees had won the third game of the Series by the time I pulled into the Texaco station on the Harris Avenue Extension. There was a sign in front of the pumps saying MECHANIC ON DUTY 7 DAYS A WEEK—TRUST YOUR CAR TO THE MAN WHO WEARS THE STAR!</p><p class="calibre13">While the pump-jockey filled the tank and washed the Sunliner’s windshield, I wandered into the garage bay, found a mechanic by the name of Randy Baker on duty, and did a little dickering with him. Baker was puzzled, but agreeable to my proposal. Twenty dollars changed hands. He gave me the numbers of both the station and his home. I left with a full tank, a clean windshield, and a satisfied mind. Well . . . <span class="italic">relatively</span> satisfied. It was impossible to plan for every contingency.</p><p class="calibre13">Because of my preparations for the following day, I dropped by The Lamplighter for my evening beer later than usual, but there was no risk of encountering Frank Dunning. It was his day to take his kids to the football game in Orono, and on the way back they were going to stop at the Ninety-Fiver for fried clams and milkshakes.</p><p class="calibre13">Chaz Frati was at the bar, sipping rye and water. “You better hope the Braves win tomorrow, or you’re out five hundred,” he said.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">They <span class="italic">were</span> going to win, but I had bigger things on my mind. I’d stay in Derry long enough to collect my three grand from<br class="calibre6"/>Mr. Frati, but I intended to finish my real business the following day. If things went as I hoped, I’d be done in Derry before Milwaukee scored what would prove to be the only run they needed in the sixth inning.</p><p class="calibre13">“Well,” I said, ordering a beer and some Lobster Pickin’s, “we’ll just have to see, won’t we?”</p><p class="calibre13">“That’s right, cuz. It’s the joy of the wager. Mind if I ask you a question?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Nope. Just as long as you won’t be offended if I don’t answer.”</p><p class="calibre13">“That’s what I like about you, cuz—that sensayuma. Must be a Wisconsin thing. What I’m curious about is why you’re in our fair city.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Real estate. I thought I told you that.”</p><p class="calibre13">He leaned close. I could smell Vitalis on his slicked-back hair and Sen-Sen on his breath. “And if I said ‘possible mall site,’ would that be a bingo?”</p><p class="calibre13">So we talked for awhile, but you already know that part.</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">6</span></span></p><p class="calibre21">I’ve said I stayed away from The Lamplighter when I thought Frank Dunning might be there because I already knew everything about him that I needed to know. It’s the truth, but not <span class="italic">all</span> of the truth. I need to make that clear. If I don’t, you’ll never understand why I behaved as I did in Texas.</p><p class="calibre13">Imagine coming into a room and seeing a complex, multistory house of cards on the table. Your mission is to knock it over. If that was all, it would be easy, wouldn’t it? A hard stamp of the foot or a big puff of air—the kind you muster when it’s time to blow out all the birthday candles—would be enough to do the job. But that’s <span class="italic">not</span> all. The thing is, you have to knock that house of cards down at a specific moment in time. Until then, it must stand.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">I knew where Dunning was going to be on the afternoon of Sunday, October 5, 1958, and I didn’t want to risk changing his course by so much as a single jot or tittle. Even crossing eyes with him in The Lamplighter might have done that. You could snort and call me excessively cautious; you could say such a minor matter would be very unlikely to knock events off-course. But the past is as fragile as a butterfly’s wing. Or a house of cards.</p><p class="calibre13">I had come back to Derry to knock Frank Dunning’s house of cards down, but until then I had to protect it.</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">7</span></span></p><p class="calibre21">I bade Chaz Frati goodnight and went back to my apartment. My bottle of Kaopectate was in the bathroom medicine cabinet, and my new souvenir pillow with the Standpipe embroidered on it in gold thread was on the kitchen table. I took a knife from the silverware drawer and carefully cut the pillow along a diagonal. I put my revolver inside, shoving it deep into the stuffing.</p><p class="calibre13">I wasn’t sure I’d sleep, but I did, and soundly. <span class="italic">Do your best and let God do the rest</span> is just one of many sayings Christy dragged back from her AA meetings. I don’t know if there’s a God or not—for Jake Epping, the jury’s still out on that one—but when I went to bed that night, I was pretty sure I’d done my best. All I could do now was get some sleep and hope my best was enough.</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">8</span></span></p><p class="calibre21">There was no stomach flu. This time I awoke at first light with the most paralyzing headache of my life. A migraine, I supposed. I didn’t know for sure, because I’d never had one. Looking into even dim light produced a sick, rolling thud from the nape of my neck to the base of my sinuses. My eyes gushed senseless tears.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">I got up (even that hurt), put on a pair of cheap sunglasses I’d picked up on my trip north to Derry, and took five aspirin. They helped just enough for me to be able to get dressed and into my overcoat. Which I would need; the morning was chilly and gray, threatening rain. In a way, that was a plus. I’m not sure I could have survived in sunlight.</p><p class="calibre13">I needed a shave, but skipped it; I thought standing under a bright light—one doubled in the bathroom mirror—might cause my brains simply to disintegrate. I couldn’t imagine how I was going to get through this day, so I didn’t try. <span class="italic">One step at a time,</span> I told myself as I walked slowly down the stairs. I was clutching the railing with one hand and my souvenir pillow with the other. I must have looked like an overgrown child with a teddy bear. <span class="italic">One step at a ti—</span></p><p class="calibre13">The banister snapped.</p><p class="calibre13">For a moment I tilted forward, head thudding, hands waving wildly in the air. I dropped the pillow (the gun inside clunked) and clawed at the wall above my head. In the last second before my tilt would have become a bone-breaking tumble, my fingers clutched one of the old-fashioned wall sconces screwed into the plaster. It pulled free, but the electrical wire held just long enough for me to regain my balance.</p><p class="calibre13">I sat down on the steps with my throbbing head on my knees. The pain pulsed in sync with the jackhammer beat of my heart. My watering eyes felt too big for their sockets. I could tell you I wanted to creep back to my apartment and give it all up, but that wouldn’t be the truth. The truth was I wanted to die right there on the stairs and have done with it. Are there people who have such headaches not just occasionally but <span class="italic">frequently</span>? If so, God help them.</p><p class="calibre13">There was only one thing that could get me back on my feet, and I forced my aching brains not just to think of it but see it: Tugga Dunning’s face suddenly obliterated as he crawled toward me. His hair and brains leaping into the air.</p><p class="calibre13">“Okay,” I said. “Okay, yeah, okay.”</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">I picked up the souvenir pillow and tottered the rest of the way down the stairs. I emerged into an overcast day that seemed as bright as a Sahara afternoon. I felt for my keys. They weren’t there. What I found where they should have been was a good-sized hole in my right front pants pocket. It hadn’t been there the night before, I was almost sure of that. I turned around in small, jerky steps. The keys were lying on the stoop in a litter of spilled change. I bent down, wincing as a lead weight slid forward inside my head. I picked up the keys and made my way to the Sunliner. And when I tried the ignition, my previously reliable Ford refused to start. There was a click from the solenoid. That was all.</p><p class="calibre13">I had prepared for this eventuality; what I hadn’t prepared for was having to drag my poisoned head up the stairs again. Never in my life had I wished so fervently for my Nokia. With it, I could have called from behind the wheel, then just sat quietly with my eyes closed until Randy Baker came.</p><p class="calibre13">Somehow, I got back up the stairs, past the broken banister and the light fixture that dangled against the torn plaster like a dead head on a broken neck. There was no answer at the service station—it was early and it was Sunday—so I tried Baker’s home number.</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="italic">He’s probably dead,</span> I thought. <span class="italic">Had a heart attack in the middle of the night. Killed by the obdurate past, with Jake Epping as the unindicted co-conspirator.</span></p><p class="calibre13">My mechanic wasn’t dead. He answered on the second ring, voice sleepy, and when I told him my car wouldn’t start, he asked the logical question: “How’d you know yesterday?”</p><p class="calibre13">“I’m a good guesser,” I said. “Get here as soon as you can, okay? There’ll be another twenty in it for you, if you can get it going.”</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">9</span></span></p><p class="calibre21">When Baker replaced the battery cable that had mysteriously come loose in the night (maybe at the same moment that hole was appearing in the pocket of my slacks) and the Sunliner still wouldn’t start, he checked the plugs and found two that were badly corroded. He had extras in his large green toolkit, and when they were in place, my chariot roared to life.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">“It’s probably not my business, but the only place you should be going is back to bed. Or to a doctor. You’re as pale as a ghost.”</p><p class="calibre13">“It’s just a migraine. I’ll be okay. Let’s look in the trunk. I want to check the spare.”</p><p class="calibre13">We checked the spare. Flat.</p><p class="calibre13">I followed him to the Texaco through what had become a light, steady drizzle. The cars we passed had their headlights on, and even with the sunglasses, each pair seemed to bore holes through my brain. Baker unlocked the service bay and tried to blow up my spare. No go. It hissed air from half a dozen cracks almost as fine as pores in human skin.</p><p class="calibre13">“Huh,” he said. “Never seen that before. Tire must be defective.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Put another one on the rim,” I said.</p><p class="calibre13">I went around to the back of the station while he did it. I couldn’t stand the sound of the compressor. I leaned against the cinderblock and turned my face up, letting cold mist fall on my hot skin. <span class="italic">One step at a time,</span> I told myself. <span class="italic">One step at a time.</span></p><p class="calibre13">When I tried to pay Randy Baker for the tire, he shook his head. “You already give me half a week’s pay. I’d be a dog to take more. I’m just worried you’ll run off the road, or something. Is it really that important?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Sick relative.”</p><p class="calibre13">“You’re sick yourself, man.”</p><p class="calibre13">I couldn’t deny it.</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">10</span></span></p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre21">I drove out of town on Route 7, slowing to look both ways at every intersection whether I had the right of way or not. This turned out to be an excellent idea, because a fully loaded gravel truck blew through a red at the intersection of 7 and the Old Derry Road. If I hadn’t come to an almost complete stop in spite of a green light, my Ford would have been demolished. With me turned to hamburger inside it. I laid on my horn in spite of the pain in my head, but the driver paid no attention. He looked like a zombie behind the wheel.</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="italic">I’ll never be able to do this,</span> I thought. But if I couldn’t stop Frank Dunning, how could I even hope to stop Oswald? Why go to Texas at all?</p><p class="calibre13">That wasn’t what kept me moving, though. It was the thought of Tugga that did that. Not to mention the other three kids. I had saved them once. If I didn’t save them again, how could I escape the sure knowledge that I had participated in murdering them, just by triggering another reset?</p><p class="calibre13">I approached the Derry Drive-In, and turned into the gravel drive leading to the shuttered box office. The drive was lined with decorative fir trees. I parked behind them, turned off the engine, and tried to get out of the car. I couldn’t. The door wouldn’t open. I slammed my shoulder against it a couple of times, and when it still wouldn’t open, I saw the lock was pushed down even though this was long before the era of self-locking cars, and I hadn’t pushed it down myself. I pulled on it. It wouldn’t come up. I wiggled it. It wouldn’t come up. I unrolled my window, leaned out, and managed to use my key on the door lock below the chrome thumb-button on the outside handle. This time the lock popped up. I got out, then reached in for the souvenir pillow.</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="italic">Resistance to change is proportional to how much the future might be altered by any given act,</span> I had told Al in my best school-lecture voice, and it was true. But I’d had no idea of the personal cost. Now I did.</p><p class="calibre13">I walked slowly up Route 7, my collar raised against the rain and my hat pulled low over my ears. When cars came—they were infrequent—I faded back into the trees that lined my side of the road. I think that once or twice I put my hands on the sides of my head to make sure it wasn’t swelling. It <span class="italic">felt</span> like it was.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">At last, the trees pulled back. They were replaced by a rock wall. Beyond the wall were manicured rolling hills dotted with headstones and monuments. I had come to Longview Cemetery. I breasted a hill, and there was the flower stand on the other side of the road. It was shuttered and dark. Weekends would ordinarily be busy visiting-the-dead-relatives days, but in weather like this, business would be slow, and I supposed the old lady who ran the place was sleeping in a little bit. She would open later, though. I had seen that for myself.</p><p class="calibre13">I climbed the wall, expecting it to give way beneath me, but it didn’t. And once I was actually in Longview, a wonderful thing happened: the headache began to abate. I sat on a gravestone beneath an overhanging elm tree, closed my eyes, and checked the pain level. What had been a screaming 10—maybe even turned up to 11, like a Spinal Tap amplifier—had gone back to 8.</p><p class="calibre13">“I think I broke through, Al,” I said. “I think I might be on the other side.”</p><p class="calibre13">Still, I moved carefully, alert for more tricks—falling trees, graverobbing thugs, maybe even a flaming meteor. There was nothing. By the time I reached the side-by-side graves marked ALTHEA PIERCE DUNNING and JAMES ALLEN DUNNING, the pain in my head was down to a 5.</p><p class="calibre13">I looked around and saw a mausoleum with a familiar name engraved on the pink granite: TRACKER. I went to it and tried the iron gate. In 2011 it would have been locked, but this was 1958 and it swung open easily . . . although with a horror-movie squall of rusty hinges.</p><p class="calibre13">I went inside, kicking my way through a drift of old brittle leaves. There was a stone meditation bench running up the center of the vault; on either side were stone storage lockers for Trackers going all the way back to 1831. According to the copper plate on the front of that earliest one, the bones of Monsieur Jean Paul Traiche lay within.</p><p class="calibre13">I closed my eyes.</p><p class="calibre13">Lay down on the meditation bench and dozed.</p><p class="calibre13">Slept.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">When I woke up it was close to noon. I went to the front door of the Tracker vault to wait for Dunning . . . just as Oswald, five years from now, would no doubt wait for the Kennedy motorcade in his shooter’s blind on the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository.</p><p class="calibre13">My headache was gone.</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">11</span></span></p><p class="calibre21">Dunning’s Pontiac appeared around the same time Red Schoendienst was scoring that day’s winning run for the Milwaukee Braves. Dunning parked on the closest feeder lane, got out, turned up his collar, then bent back in to get the flower baskets. He walked down the hill to his parents’ graves carrying one in each hand.</p><p class="calibre13">Now that the time had come, I was pretty much okay. I had gotten on the other side of whatever had been trying to hold me back. The souvenir pillow was under my coat. My hand was inside. The wet grass muffled my footsteps. There was no sun to cast my shadow. He didn’t know I was behind him until I spoke his name. Then he turned around.</p><p class="calibre13">“When I’m visiting my folks, I don’t like company,” he said. “Who the hell are you, anyway? And what’s that?” He was looking at the pillow, which I had taken out. I was wearing it like a glove.</p><p class="calibre13">I chose to answer the first question only. “My name’s Jake Epping. I came out here to ask you a question.”</p><p class="calibre13">“So ask and then leave me alone.” Rain was dripping off the brim of his hat. Mine, too.</p><p class="calibre13">“What’s the most important thing in life, Dunning?”</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="italic">“What?”</span></p><p class="calibre13">“To a man, I mean.”</p><p class="calibre13">“What are you, wacky? What’s with the pillow, anyway?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Humor me. Answer the question.”</p><p class="calibre13">He shrugged. “His family, I suppose.”</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">“I think so, too,” I said, and pulled the trigger twice. The first report was a muffled thump, like hitting a rug with a carpet beater. The second was a little louder. I thought the pillow might catch on fire—I saw that in <span class="italic">Godfather 2</span>—but it only smoldered a little. Dunning fell over, crushing the basket of flowers he’d placed on his father’s grave. I knelt beside him, my knee squelching up water from the wet earth, placed the torn end of the pillow against his temple, and fired again. Just to make sure.</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">12</span></span></p><p class="calibre21">I dragged him into the Tracker mausoleum and dropped the scorched pillow on his face. When I left, a couple of cars were driving slowly through the cemetery, and a few people were standing under umbrellas at gravesites, but nobody was paying any attention to me. I walked without haste toward the rock wall, pausing every now and then to look at a grave or monument. Once I was screened by trees, I jogged back to my Ford. When I heard cars coming, I slipped into the woods. On one of those retreats, I buried the gun under a foot of earth and leaves. The Sunliner was waiting undisturbed where I’d left it, and it started on the first crank. I drove back to my apartment and listened to the end of the baseball game. I cried a little, I think. Those were tears of relief, not remorse. No matter what happened to me, the Dunning family was safe.</p><p class="calibre13">I slept like a baby that night.</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">13</span></span></p><p class="calibre21">There was plenty about the World Series in Monday’s Derry <span class="italic">Daily News,</span> including a nice pic of Schoendienst sliding home with the winning run after a Tony Kubek error. According to Red Barber’s column, the Bronx Bombers were finished. “Stick a fork in em,” he opined. “The Yanks are dead, long live the Yanks.”</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">Nothing about Frank Dunning to start Derry’s workweek, but he was front-page material in Tuesday’s paper, along with a photo that showed him grinning with the-ladies-love-me good cheer. His devilish George Clooney twinkle was all present and accounted for.</p><p class="calibre1"><span class="bold">BUSINESSMAN FOUND MURDERED IN LOCAL CEMETERY</span><br class="calibre6"/><span class="italic">Dunning Was Prominent in Many Charity Drives</span></p><p class="calibre13">According to the Derry Chief of Police, the department was following up all sorts of good leads and an arrest was expected soon. Reached by phone, Doris Dunning declared herself to be “shocked and devastated.” There was no mention of the fact that she and the decedent had been living apart. Various friends and co-workers at the Center Street Market expressed similar shock. Everyone seemed in agreement that Frank Dunning had been an absolutely terrific guy, and no one could guess why someone would want to shoot him.</p><p class="calibre13">Tony Tracker was especially outraged (possibly because the corpse had been found in the family body-bank). “For this guy, they ought to bring back the death penalty,” he said.</p><p class="calibre13">On Wednesday, the eighth of October, the Yankees squeezed out a two-to-one win over the Braves at County Stadium; on Thursday they broke a two-two tie in the eighth, scoring four runs and closing the Series out. On Friday, I went back to the Mermaid Pawn &amp; Loan, expecting to be met there by Mrs. Grump and Mr. Gloom. The large lady more than lived up to my expectations—she curled her lip when she saw me and shouted, “Chazzy! Mr. Moneybags is here!” Then she shoved through the curtained-off doorway and out of my life.</p><p class="calibre13">Frati came out wearing the same chipmunk grin I’d first encountered in The Lamplighter, on my previous trip into Derry’s colorful past. In one hand he was holding a well-stuffed envelope with G. AMBERSON printed on the front.</p><p class="calibre13">“There you are, cuz,” he said, “big as life and twice as handsome. And here’s your loot. Feel free to count it.”</p><p class="calibre13">“I trust you,” I said, and put the envelope in my pocket. “You’re mighty cheery for a fellow who just forked over three large.”</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">“I won’t deny that you cut into this year’s Fall Classic take,” he said. “<span class="italic">Seriously</span> cut into it, although I still made a few bucks. I always do. But I’m mostly in the game because it’s a whattayacallit, public service. People are gonna bet, people are always gonna bet, and I give em a prompt payoff when a payoff’s due. Also, I like taking bets. It’s a kind of hobby with me. And do you know when I like it best?”</p><p class="calibre13">“No.”</p><p class="calibre13">“When someone like you comes along, a real stampeder who bucks the odds and comes through. That restores my faith in the random nature of the universe.”</p><p class="calibre13">I wondered how random he’d think it was if he could see Al Templeton’s cheat sheet.</p><p class="calibre13">“Your wife’s view doesn’t appear to be so, um, catholic.”</p><p class="calibre13">He laughed, and his small black eyes sparkled. Win, lose, or draw, the little man with the mermaid on his arm flat-out enjoyed life. I admired that. “Oh, Marjorie. When some sad sack comes in here with his wife’s engagement ring and a sob story, she turns into a pile of goo. But on the sports-book stuff, she’s a different lady. That she takes personal.”</p><p class="calibre13">“You love her a lot, don’t you, Mr. Frati?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Like the moon and the stars, cuz. Like the moon and the stars.”</p><p class="calibre13">Marjorie had been reading that day’s paper, and it was still on the glass-topped counter containing the rings and things. The headline read HUNT FOR MYSTERY KILLER GOES ON AS FRANK DUNNING IS LAID TO REST.</p><p class="calibre13">“What do you reckon <span class="italic">that</span> was about?” I asked.</p><p class="calibre13">“Dunno, but I’ll tell you something.” He leaned forward, and the smile was gone. “He wasn’t the saint the local rag is makin him out to be. I could tell you stories, cuz.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Go ahead. I’ve got all day.”</p><p class="calibre13">The smile reappeared. “Nah. In Derry, we keep ourselves to ourselves.”</p><p class="calibre13">“So I’ve noticed,” I said.</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">14</span></span></p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre21">I wanted to go back to Kossuth Street. I knew the cops might be watching the Dunning house to see if anyone showed an unusual interest in the family, but the desire was very strong, just the same. It wasn’t Harry I wanted to see; it was his little sister. There were things I wanted to tell her.</p><p class="calibre13">That she should go out trick-or-treating on Halloween no matter how sad she felt about her daddy.</p><p class="calibre13">That she’d be the prettiest, most magical Indian princess anyone had ever seen, and would come home with a mountain of candy.</p><p class="calibre13">That she had at least fifty-three long and busy years ahead of her, and probably many more.</p><p class="calibre13">Most of all that someday her brother Harry was going to want to put on a uniform and go for a soldier and she must do her very, very, very best to talk him out of it.</p><p class="calibre13">Only kids forget. Every teacher knows this.</p><p class="calibre13">And they think they’re going to live forever.</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">15</span></span></p><p class="calibre21">It was time to leave Derry, but I had one final little chore to take care of before I went. I waited until Monday. That afternoon, the thirteenth of October, I threw my valise into the Sunliner’s trunk, then sat behind the wheel long enough to scribble a brief note. I tucked it into an envelope, sealed it, and printed the recipient’s name on the front.</p><p class="calibre13">I drove down to the Low Town, parked, and walked into the Sleepy Silver Dollar. It was empty except for Pete the bartender, as I had expected. He was washing glasses and watching <span class="italic">Love of Life</span> on the boob tube. He turned to me reluctantly, keeping one eye on John and Marsha, or whatever their names were.</p><p class="calibre13">“What can I get you?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Nothing, but you can do me a favor. For which I will compensate you to the tune of five American dollars.”</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">He looked unimpressed. “Really. What’s the favor?”</p><p class="calibre13">I put the envelope on the bar. “Pass this over when the proper party comes in.”</p><p class="calibre13">He looked at the name on the front of the envelope. “What do you want with Billy Turcotte? And why don’t you give it to him yourself?”</p><p class="calibre13">“It’s a simple enough assignment, Pete. Do you want the five, or not?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Sure. Long as it won’t do no harm. Billy’s a good enough soul.”</p><p class="calibre13">“It won’t do him any harm. It might even do him some good.”</p><p class="calibre13">I put a fin on top of the envelope. Pete made it disappear and went back to his soap opera. I left. Turcotte probably got the envelope. Whether or not he did anything after he read what was inside is another question, one of many to which I will never have answers. This is what I wrote:</p><blockquote class="calibre24"><span class="italic">Dear Bill—</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre24"><span class="italic">There is something wrong with your heart. You must go to the doctor soon, or it will be too late. You might think this is a joke, but it is not. You might think I couldn’t know such a thing, but I do. I know it as surely as you know Frank Dunning murdered your sister Clara and your nephew Mikey.</span>
<span class="italic">PLEASE BELIEVE ME AND GO TO THE DOCTOR!</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre26"><span class="italic">A Friend</span></blockquote><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">16</span></span></p><p class="calibre21">I got into my Sunliner, and as I backed out of the slant parking slot, I saw Mr. Keene’s narrow and mistrustful face peering out at me from the drugstore. I unrolled my window, stuck out my arm, and shot him the bird. Then I drove up Up-Mile Hill and out of Derry for the last time.</p><div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_24"></div></body>
