I ate in a lot of roadside restaurants featuring Mom’s Home Cooking, places where the Blue Plate Special, including fruit cup to start and pie à la mode for dessert, cost eighty cents. I never saw a single fast-food franchise, unless you count Howard Johnson’s, with its 28 Flavors and Simple Simon logo. I saw a troop of Boy Scouts tending a bonfire of fall leaves with their Scoutmaster; I saw women wearing overcoats and galoshes taking in laundry on a gray afternoon when rain threatened; I saw long passenger trains with names like <span class="italic">The Southern Flyer</span> and <span class="italic">Star of Tampa</span> charging toward those American climes where winter is not allowed. I saw old men smoking pipes on benches in town squares. I saw a million churches, and a cemetery where a congregation at least a hundred strong stood in a circle around an open grave singing “The Old Rugged Cross.” I saw men building barns. I saw people helping people. Two of them in a pickup truck stopped to help me when the Sunliner’s radiator popped its top and I was broken down by the side of the road. That was in Virginia, around four o’clock in the afternoon, and one of them asked me if I needed a place to sleep. I guess I can imagine that happening in 2011, but it’s a stretch.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">And one more thing. In North Carolina, I stopped to gas up at a Humble Oil station, then walked around the corner to use the toilet. There were two doors and three signs. <span class="bold">MEN</span> was neatly stenciled over one door, <span class="bold">LADIES</span> over the other. The third sign was an arrow on a stick. It pointed toward the brush-covered slope behind the station. It said COLORED. Curious, I walked down the path, being careful to sidle at a couple of points where the oily, green-shading-to-maroon leaves of poison ivy were unmistakable. I hoped the dads and moms who might have led their children down to whatever facility waited below were able to identify those troublesome bushes for what they were, because in the late fifties most children wear short pants.</p><p class="calibre13">There <span class="italic">was</span> no facility. What I found at the end of the path was a narrow stream with a board laid across it on a couple of crumbling concrete posts. A man who had to urinate could just stand on the bank, unzip, and let fly. A woman could hold onto a bush (assuming it wasn’t poison ivy or poison oak) and squat. The board was what you sat on if you had to take a shit. Maybe in the pouring rain.</p><p class="calibre13">If I ever gave you the idea that 1958’s all Andy-n-Opie, remember the path, okay? The one lined with poison ivy. And the board over the stream.</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">2</span></span></p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre21">I settled sixty miles south of Tampa, in the town of Sunset Point. For eighty dollars a month, I rented a conch shack on the most beautiful (and mostly deserted) beach I had ever seen. There were four similar shacks on my stretch of sand, all as humble as my own. Of the nouveau-ugly McMansions that would later sprout like concrete toadstools in this part of the state, I saw none. There was a supermarket ten miles south, in Nokomis, and a sleepy shopping district in Venice. Route 41, the Tamiami Trail, was little more than a country road. You had to go slow on it, particularly toward dusk, because that’s when the gators and the armadillos liked to cross. Between Sarasota and Venice, there were fruit stands, roadside markets, a couple of bars, and a dancehall called Blackie’s. Beyond Venice, brother, you were mostly on your own, at least until you got to Fort Myers.</p><p class="calibre13">I left George Amberson’s real estate persona behind. By the spring of 1959, recessionary times had come to America. On Florida’s Gulf Coast, everybody was selling and nobody was buying, so George Amberson became exactly what Al had envisioned: an authorial wannabe whose moderately rich uncle had left him enough to live on, at least for awhile.</p><p class="calibre13">I <span class="italic">did</span> write, and not on one project but two. In the mornings, when I was freshest, I began work on the manuscript you’re now reading (if there ever <span class="italic">is</span> a you). In the evenings I worked on a novel that I tentatively called <span class="italic">The Murder Place.</span> The place in question was Derry, of course, although I called it Dawson in my book. I began it solely as set decoration, so I’d have something to show if I made friends and one of them asked to see what I was working on (I kept my “morning manuscript” in a steel lockbox under my bed). Eventually <span class="italic">The Murder Place</span> became more than camouflage. I began to think it was good, and to dream that someday it might even see print.</p><p class="calibre13">An hour on the memoir in the morning and an hour on the novel at night still left a lot of time to be filled. I tried fishing, and there were plenty of fish to be caught, but I didn’t like it and gave it up. Walking was fine at dawn and sunset, but not in the heat of the day. I became a regular patron of Sarasota’s one bookstore, and I spent long (and mostly happy) hours at the little libraries in Nokomis and Osprey.</p><p class="calibre13">I read and reread Al’s Oswald stuff, too. Finally I recognized this for the obsessive behavior it was, and put the notebook in the lockbox with my “morning manuscript.” I have called those notes exhaustive, and so they seemed to me then, but as time—the conveyor belt on which we all must ride—brought me closer and closer to the point where my life might converge with that of the young assassin-to-be, they began to seem less so. There were holes.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">Sometimes I cursed Al for forcing me into this mission willy-nilly, but in more clearheaded moments, I realized that extra time wouldn’t have made any difference. It might have made things worse, and Al probably knew it. Even if he hadn’t committed suicide, I would only have had a week or two, and how many books have been written about the chain of events leading up to that day in Dallas? A hundred? Three hundred? Probably closer to a thousand. Some agreeing with Al’s belief that Oswald acted alone, some claiming he’d been part of an elaborate conspiracy, some stating with utter certainty that he hadn’t pulled the trigger at all and was exactly what he called himself after his arrest, a patsy. By committing suicide, Al had taken away the scholar’s greatest weakness: calling hesitation research.</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">3</span></span></p><p class="calibre21">I made occasional trips to Tampa, where discreet questioning led me to a bookmaker named Eduardo Gutierrez. Once he was sure I wasn’t a cop, he was delighted to take my action. I first bet the Minneapolis Lakers to beat the Celtics in the ’59 championship series, thereby establishing my bona fides as a sucker; the Lakers didn’t win a single game. I also bet four hundred on the Canadians to beat the Maple Leafs in the Stanley Cup Series, and won . . . but that was even money. Chump change, cuz, my pal Chaz Frati would have said.</p><p class="calibre13">My single large strike came in the spring of 1960, when I bet on Venetian Way to beat Bally Ache, the heavy favorite in the Kentucky Derby. Gutierrez said he’d give me four-to-one on a gee, five-to-one on a double gee. I went for the double after making the appropriate noises of hesitation, and came away ten thousand richer. He paid off with Frati-esque good cheer, but there was a steely glint in his eyes that I didn’t care for.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">Gutierrez was a Cubano who probably didn’t weigh one-forty soaking wet, but he was also an expat from the New Orleans Mob, run in those days by a bad boy named Carlos Marcello. I got this bit of gossip in the billiard parlor next to the barbershop where Gutierrez ran his book (and an apparently never-ending backroom poker game under a photograph of a barely clad Diana Dors). The man with whom I’d been playing nineball leaned forward, looked around to make sure we had the corner table to ourselves, then murmured, “You know what they say about the Mob, George—once in, never out.”</p><p class="calibre13">I would have liked to have spoken to Gutierrez about his years in New Orleans, but I didn’t think it would be wise to be too curious, especially after my big Derby payday. If I <span class="italic">had</span> dared—and if I could have thought of a plausible way to raise the subject—I would have asked Gutierrez if he’d ever been acquainted with another reputed member of the Marcello organization, an ex-pug named Charles “Dutz” Murret. I somehow think the answer would have been yes, because the past harmonizes with itself. Dutz Murret’s wife was Marguerite Oswald’s sister. Which made him Lee Harvey Oswald’s uncle.</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">4</span></span></p><p class="calibre21">One day in the spring of 1959 (there <span class="italic">is</span> spring in Florida; the natives told me it sometimes lasts as long as a week), I opened my mailbox and discovered a call-card from the Nokomis Public Library. I had reserved a copy of <span class="italic">The Disenchanted,</span> the new Budd Schulberg novel, and it had just come in. I jumped in my Sunliner—no better car for what was then becoming known as the Sun Coast—and drove up to get it.</p><p class="calibre13">On my way out, I noticed a new poster on the cluttered bulletin board in the foyer. It would have been hard to miss; it was bright blue and featured a shivering cartoon man who was looking at an oversized thermometer where the mercury was registering ten below zero. GOT A DEGREE PROBLEM? the poster demanded. YOU MAY BE ELIGIBLE FOR A MAIL-ORDER CERTIFICATE FROM UNITED COLLEGE OF OKLAHOMA! WRITE FOR DETAILS!</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">United College of Oklahoma sounded fishier than a mackerel stew, but it gave me an idea. Mostly because I was bored. Oswald was still in the Marines, and wouldn’t be discharged until September, when he would head for Russia. His first move would be an effort to renounce his American citizenship. He wouldn’t succeed, but after a showy—and probably bogus—suicide attempt in a Moscow hotel, the Russians were going to let him stay in their country. “On approval,” so to speak. He’d be there for thirty months or so, working at a radio factory in Minsk. And at a party he would meet a girl named Marina Prusakova. <span class="italic">Red dress, white slippers,</span> Al had written in his notes. <span class="italic">Pretty. Dressed for dancing.</span></p><p class="calibre13">Fine for him, but what was I going to do in the meantime? United College offered one possibility. I wrote for details, and received a prompt response. The catalogue touted an absolute plethora of degrees. I was fascinated to discover that, for three hundred dollars (cash or money order), I could receive a bachelor’s in English. All I had to do was pass a test consisting of fifty multiple choice questions.</p><p class="calibre13">I got the money order, mentally kissed my three hundred goodbye, and sent in an application. Two weeks later, I received a thin manila envelope from United College. Inside were two smearily mimeographed sheets. The questions were wonderful. Here are two of my favorites:</p><blockquote class="calibre24"> 22. What was “Moby’s” last name?</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre24"> A. Tom</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre24"> B. Dick</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre24"> C. Harry</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre24"> D. John</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre24"> 37. Who wrote “The House of 7 Tables”?</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre24"> A. Charles Dickens</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre24"> B. Henry James</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre24"> C. Ann Bradstreet</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre24"> D. Nathaniel Hawthorne</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre24"> E. None of these</blockquote><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">When I finished enjoying this wonderful test, I filled out the answers (with the occasional cry of “You’ve <span class="italic">got</span> to be shitting me!”) and sent it back to Enid, Oklahoma. I got a postcard by return mail congratulating me on passing my exam. After I had paid an additional fifty-dollar “administration fee,” I was informed, I would be sent my degree. So I was told, and lo, so it came to pass. The degree was a good deal better looking than the test had been, and came with an impressive gold seal. When I presented it to a representative of the Sarasota County Schoolboard, that worthy accepted it without question and put me on the substitute list.</p><p class="calibre13">Which is how I ended up teaching again for one or two days each week during the 1959–1960 academic year. It was good to be back. I enjoyed the students—boys with flattop crewcuts, girls with ponytails and shin-length poodle skirts—although I was painfully aware that the faces I saw in the various classrooms I visited were all of the plain vanilla variety. Those days of substituting reacquainted me with a basic fact of my personality: I liked writing, and had discovered I was good at it, but what I loved was teaching. It filled me up in some way I can’t explain. Or want to. Explanations are such cheap poetry.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">My best day as a sub came at West Sarasota High, after I’d told an American Lit class the basic story of <span class="italic">The Catcher in the Rye</span> (a book which was not, of course, allowed in the school library and would have been confiscated if brought into those sacred halls by a student) and then encouraged them to talk about Holden Caulfield’s chief complaint: that school, grown-ups, and American life in general were all phony. The kids started slow, but by the time the bell rang, everyone was trying to talk at once, and half a dozen risked tardiness at their next classes to offer some final opinion on what was wrong with the society they saw around them and the lives their parents had planned for them. Their eyes were bright, their faces flushed with excitement. I had no doubt there was going to be a run on a certain dark red paperback at the area bookstores. The last one to leave was a muscular kid wearing a football sweater. To me he looked like Moose Mason in the Archie comic books.</p><p class="calibre13">“Ah wish you was here all the time, Mr. Amberson,” he said in his soft Southern accent. “Ah dig you the most.”</p><p class="calibre13">He didn’t just dig me; he dug me the <span class="italic">most.</span> Nothing can compare to hearing something like that from a seventeen-year-old kid who looks like he might be fully awake for the first time in his academic career.</p><p class="calibre13">Later that month, the principal called me into his office, offered some pleasantries and a Co’-Cola, then asked: “Son, are you a subversive?” I assured him I was not. I told him I’d voted for Ike. He seemed satisfied, but suggested I might stick more to the “generally accepted reading list” in the future. Hairstyles change, and skirt lengths, and slang, but high school administrations? Never.</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">5</span></span></p><p class="calibre21">In a college class once (this was at the University of Maine, a real college from which I had obtained a real BS degree), I heard a psychology prof opine that humans actually <span class="italic">do</span> possess a sixth sense. He called it <span class="italic">hunch-think,</span> and said it was most well developed in mystics and outlaws. I was no mystic, but I was both an exile from my own time and a murderer (I might consider the shooting of Frank Dunning justified, but the police certainly wouldn’t see it that way). If those things didn’t make me an outlaw, nothing could.</p><p class="calibre13">“My advice to you in situations where danger appears to threaten,” the prof said that day in 1995, “is heed the hunch.”</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">I decided to do just that in July of 1960. I was becoming increasingly uneasy about Eduardo Gutierrez. He was a little guy, but there were those reputed Mob connections to consider . . . and the glint in his eyes when he’d paid off on my Derby bet, which I now considered foolishly large. Why had I made it, when I was still far from broke? It wasn’t greed; it was more the way a good hitter feels, I suppose, when he is presented with a hanging curveball. In some cases, you just can’t help swinging for the fences. I swang, as Leo “The Lip” Durocher used to put it in his colorful radio broadcasts, but now I regretted it.</p><p class="calibre13">I purposely lost the last two wagers I put down with Gutierrez, trying my best to make myself look foolish, just a garden-variety plunger who happened to get lucky once and would presently lose it all back, but my hunch-think told me it wasn’t playing very well. My hunch-think didn’t like it when Gutierrez started greeting me with, “Oh, see! Here comes my Yanqui from Yankeeland.” Not <span class="italic">the</span> Yanqui; <span class="italic">my</span> Yanqui.</p><p class="calibre13">Suppose he had detailed one of his poker-playing friends to follow me back to Sunset Point from Tampa? Was it possible he might send some of his other poker-playing friends—or a couple of muscle boys hungry to get out from under whatever loan-shark vig Gutierrez was currently charging—to do a little salvage operation and get back whatever remained of that ten thousand? My front mind thought that was the sort of lame plot device that turned up on PI shows like <span class="italic">77 Sunset Strip,</span> but hunch said something different. Hunch said that the little man with the thinning hair was perfectly capable of green-lighting a home invasion, and telling the black-baggers to beat the shit out of me if I tried to object. I didn’t want to get beaten up and I didn’t want to be robbed. Most of all, I didn’t want to risk my pages falling into the hands of a Mob-connected bookie. I didn’t like the idea of running away with my tail between my legs, but hell, I had to make my way to Texas sooner or later in any case, so why not sooner? Besides, discretion is the better part of valor. I learned that at my mother’s knee.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">So after a mostly sleepless July night when the sonar pings of hunch had been particularly strong, I packed my worldly goods (the lockbox containing my memoir and my cash I hid beneath the Sunliner’s spare tire), left a note and a final rent check for my landlord, and headed north on US 19. I spent my first night on the road in a decaying DeFuniak Springs motor court. The screens had holes in them, and until I turned out my room’s one light (an unshaded bulb dangling on a length of electrical cord), I was beset by mosquitoes the size of fighter planes.</p><p class="calibre13">Yet I slept like a baby. There were no nightmares, and the pings of my interior radar had fallen silent. That was good enough for me.</p><p class="calibre13">I spent the first of August in Gulfport, although the first place I stopped at, on the town’s outskirts, refused to take me. The clerk of the Red Top Inn explained to me that it was for Negroes only, and directed me to The Southern Hospitality, which he called “Guff-pote’s finest.” Maybe so, but on the whole, I think I would have preferred the Red Top. The slide guitar coming from the bar-and-barbecue next door had sounded terrific.</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">6</span></span></p><p class="calibre21">New Orleans wasn’t precisely on my way to Big D, but with the hunch-sonar quiet, I found myself in a touristy frame of mind . . . although it wasn’t the French Quarter, the Bienville Street steamboat landing, or the Vieux Carré I wanted to visit.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">I bought a map from a street-vendor and found my way to the one destination that did interest me. I parked and after a five-minute walk found myself standing in front of 4905 Magazine Street, where Lee and Marina Oswald would be living with their daughter, June, in the last spring and summer of John Kennedy’s life. It was a shambling not-quite-wreck of a building with a waist-high iron fence surrounding an overgrown yard. The paint on the lower story, once white, was now a peeling shade of urine yellow. The upper story was unpainted gray barnboard. A piece of cardboard blocking a broken window up there read 4-RENT CALL MU3-4192. Rusty screens enclosed the porch where, in September of 1963, Lee Oswald would sit in his underwear after dark, whispering <span class="italic">“Pow! Pow! Pow!”</span> under his breath and dry-firing what was going to become the most famous rifle in American history at passing pedestrians.</p><p class="calibre13">I was thinking of this when someone tapped me on the shoulder, and I almost screamed. I guess I <span class="italic">did</span> jump, because the young black man who had accosted me took a respectful step backward, raising his open hands.</p><p class="calibre13">“Sorry, sah. Sorry, sho din mean to make you stahtle.”</p><p class="calibre13">“It’s all right,” I said. “Totally my fault.”</p><p class="calibre13">This declaration seemed to make him uneasy, but he had business on his mind and pressed ahead with it . . . although he had to come close again, because his business entailed a tone of voice lower than the conversational. He wanted to know if I might be interested in buying a few joysticks. I thought I knew what he was talking about, but wasn’t entirely sure until he added, “Ha-quality swampweed, sah.”</p><p class="calibre13">I told him I’d pass, but if he could direct me to a good hotel in the Paris of the South, it would be worth half a rock to me. When he spoke again, his speech was a good deal crisper. “Opinions differ, but I’d say the Hotel Monteleone.” He gave me good directions.</p><p class="calibre13">“Thanks,” I said, and handed over the coin. It disappeared into one of his many pockets.</p><p class="calibre13">“Say, what you lookin at that place for, anyway?” He nodded toward the ramshackle apartment house. “You thinkin bout buyin it?”</p><p class="calibre13">A little twinkle of the old George Amberson surfaced. “You must live around here. Do you think it would be a good deal?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Some on this street might be, but not that one. To me it looks haunted.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Not yet,” I said, and headed for my car, leaving him to look after me, perplexed.</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">7</span></span></p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre21">I took the lockbox out of the trunk and put it on the Sunliner’s passenger seat, meaning to hand-carry it up to my room at the Monteleone, and I did just that. But while the doorman was getting the rest of my bags, I spotted something on the floor of the backseat that made me flush with a sense of guilt that was far out of proportion to what the object was. But childhood teachings are the strongest teachings, and another thing I was taught at my mother’s knee was to always return library books on time.</p><p class="calibre13">“Mr. Doorman, would you hand me that book, please?” I asked.</p><p class="calibre13">“Yes, sah! Happy to!”</p><p class="calibre13">It was <span class="italic">The Chapman Report,</span> which I’d borrowed from the Nokomis Public Library a week or so before deciding it was time to put on my traveling shoes. The sticker in the corner of the transparent protective cover—<span class="italic">7 DAYS ONLY, BE KIND TO THE NEXT BORROWER</span>—reproached me.</p><p class="calibre13">When I got to my room, I checked my watch and saw it was only 6:00 <span class="calibre22">P.M.</span> In the summer, the library didn’t open until noon but stayed open until eight. Long distance is one of the few things more expensive in 1960 than in 2011, but that childish sense of guilt was still on me. I called the hotel operator and gave her the Nokomis Library’s telephone number, reading it off the card-pocket pasted to the back flyleaf of the book. The little message below it, <span class="italic">Please Call if You Will Be More Than 3 Days Late in Your Return,</span> made me feel more like a dog than ever.</p><p class="calibre13">My operator talked to another operator. Behind them, faint voices babbled. I realized that in the time I came from, most of those distant speakers would be dead. Then the phone began to ring on the other end.</p><p class="calibre13">“Hello, Nokomis Public Library.” It was Hattie Wilkerson’s voice, but that sweet old lady sounded like she was stuck in a very large steel barrel.</p><p class="calibre13">“Hello, Mrs. Wilkerson—”</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">“Hello? <span class="italic">Hello?</span> Do you hear me? <span class="italic">Drat</span> long distance!”</p><p class="calibre13">“Hattie?” I was shouting now. “It’s George Amberson calling!”</p><p class="calibre13">“George <span class="italic">Amberson</span>? Oh, my soul! Where are you calling from, George?”</p><p class="calibre13">I almost told her the truth, but the hunch-radar gave out a single very loud ping and I bellowed, “Baton Rouge!”</p><p class="calibre13">“In Louisiana?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Yes! I have one of your books! I just realized! I’m going to send it ba—”</p><p class="calibre13">“You don’t need to shout, George, the connection is <span class="italic">much</span> better now. The operator must not have stuck our little plug in the whole way. I am <span class="italic">so</span> glad to hear from you. It’s God’s providence that you weren’t there. We were worried even though the fire chief said the house was empty.”</p><p class="calibre13">“What are you talking about, Hattie? My place on the beach?”</p><p class="calibre13">But really, what else?</p><p class="calibre13">“Yes! Someone threw a flaming bottle of gasoline through the window. The whole thing went up in a matter of minutes. Chief Durand thinks it was kids who were out drinking and carousing. There are so many bad apples now. It’s because they’re afraid of the Bomb, that’s what my husband says.”</p><p class="calibre13">So.</p><p class="calibre13">“George? Are you still there?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Yes,” I said.</p><p class="calibre13">“Which book do you have?”</p><p class="calibre13">“What?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Which <span class="italic">book</span> do you have? Don’t make me check the card catalogue.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Oh. <span class="italic">The Chapman Report.</span>”</p><p class="calibre13">“Well, send it back as soon as you can, won’t you? We have quite a few people waiting for that one. Irving Wallace is extremely popular.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Yes,” I said. “I’ll be sure to do that.”</p><p class="calibre13">“And I’m very sorry about your house. Did you lose your things?”</p><p class="calibre13">“I have everything important with me.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Thank God for that. Will you be coming back s—”</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">There was a click loud enough to sting my ear, then the burr of an open line. I replaced the receiver in the cradle. Would I be coming back soon? I saw no need to call back and answer that question. But I would watch out for the past, because it senses change-agents, and it has teeth.</p><p class="calibre13">I sent <span class="italic">The Chapman Report</span> back to the Nokomis Library first thing in the morning.</p><p class="calibre13">Then I left for Dallas.</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">8</span></span></p><p class="calibre21">Three days later I was sitting on a bench in Dealey Plaza and looking at the square brick cube of the Texas School Book Depository. It was late afternoon, and blazingly hot. I had pulled down my tie (if you don’t wear one in 1960, even on hot days, you’re apt to attract unwanted attention) and unbuttoned the top button of my plain white shirt, but it didn’t help much. Neither did the scant shade of the elm behind my bench.</p><p class="calibre13">When I checked into the Adolphus Hotel on Commerce Street, I was offered a choice: air-conditioning or no air-conditioning. I paid the extra five bucks for a room where the window-unit lowered the temperature all the way to seventy-eight, and if I had a brain in my head, I’d go back to it now, before I keeled over with heatstroke. When night came, maybe it would cool off. Just a little.</p><p class="calibre13">But that brick cube held my gaze, and the windows—especially the one on the right corner of the sixth floor—seemed to be examining me. There was a palpable sense of wrongness about the building. You—if there ever <span class="italic">is</span> a you—might scoff at that, calling it nothing but the effect of my unique foreknowledge, but that didn’t account for what was really holding me on that bench in spite of the beating heat. What did that was the sense that I had seen the building before.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">It reminded me of the Kitchener Ironworks, in Derry.</p><p class="calibre13">The Book Depository wasn’t a ruin, but it conveyed the same sense of sentient menace. I remembered coming on that submerged, soot-blackened smokestack, lying in the weeds like a giant prehistoric snake dozing in the sun. I remembered looking into its dark bore, so large I could have walked into it. And I remembered feeling that something was in there. Something alive. Something that <span class="italic">wanted</span> me to walk into it. So I could visit. Maybe for a long, long time.</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="italic">Come on in,</span> the sixth-floor window whispered. <span class="italic">Take a look around. The place is empty now, the skeleton crew that works here in the summer has gone home, but if you walk around to the loading dock by the railroad tracks, you’ll find an open door, I’m quite sure of it. After all, what is there in here to protect? Nothing but schoolbooks, and even the students they’re meant for don’t really want them. As you well know, Jake. So come in. Come on up to the sixth floor. In your time there’s a museum here, people come from all over the world and some of them still weep for the man who was killed and all he might have done, but this is 1960, Kennedy’s still a senator, and Jake Epping doesn’t exist. Only George Amberson exists, a man with a short haircut and a sweaty shirt and a pulled-down tie. A man of his time, so to speak. So come on up. Are you afraid of ghosts? How can you be, when the crime hasn’t happened yet?</span></p><p class="calibre13">But there <span class="italic">were</span> ghosts up there. Maybe not on Magazine Street in New Orleans, but there? Oh yes. Only I’d never have to face them, because I was going to enter the Book Depository no more than I had ventured into that fallen smokestack in Derry. Oswald would get his job stacking textbooks just a month or so before the assassination, and waiting that long would be cutting things far too close. No, I intended to follow the plan Al had roughed out in the closing section of his notes, the one titled <span class="italic">CONCLUSIONS ON HOW TO PROCEDE.</span></p><p class="calibre13">Sure as he was about his lone gunman theory, Al had held onto a small but statistically significant possibility that he was wrong. In his notes, he called it “the window of uncertainty.”</p><p class="calibre13">As in sixth-floor window.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">He had meant to close that window for good on April 10, 1963, over half a year before Kennedy’s trip to Dallas, and I thought his idea made sense. Possibly later that April, more likely on the night of the tenth—why wait?—I would kill the husband of Marina and the father of June just as I had Frank Dunning. And with no more compunction. If you saw a spider scuttering across the floor toward your baby’s crib, you might hesitate. You might even consider trapping it in a bottle and putting it out in the yard so it could go on living its little life. But if you were sure that spider was poisonous? A black widow? In that case, you wouldn’t hesitate. Not if you were sane.</p><p class="calibre13">You’d put your foot on it and crush it.</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">9</span></span></p><p class="calibre21">I had a plan of my own for the years between August of 1960 and April of 1963. I’d keep my eye on Oswald when he came back from Russia, but I wouldn’t interfere. Because of the butterfly effect, I couldn’t afford to. If there’s a stupider metaphor than <span class="italic">a chain of events</span> in the English language, I don’t know what it is. Chains (other than the ones we all learned to make out of strips of colored paper in kindergarten, I suppose) are strong. We use them to pull engine blocks out of trucks and to bind the arms and legs of dangerous prisoners. That was no longer reality as I understood it. Events are flimsy, I tell you, they are houses of cards, and by approaching Oswald—let alone trying to warn him off a crime which he had not yet even conceived—I would be giving away my only advantage. The butterfly would spread its wings, and Oswald’s course would change.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">Little changes at first, maybe, but as the Bruce Springsteen song tells us, from small things, baby, big things one day come. They might be good changes, ones that would save the man who was now the junior senator from Massachusetts. But I didn’t believe that. Because the past is obdurate. In 1962, according to one of Al’s scribbled marginal notes, Kennedy was going to be in Houston, at Rice University, making a speech about going to the moon. <span class="italic">Open auditorium, no bullet-pr’f podium,</span> Al had written. Houston was less than three hundred miles from Dallas. What if Oswald decided to shoot the president there?</p><p class="calibre13">Or suppose Oswald was exactly what he claimed to be, a patsy? What if I scared him out of Dallas and back to New Orleans and Kennedy <span class="italic">still</span> died, the victim of some crazy Mafia or CIA plot? Would I have courage enough to go back through the rabbit-hole and start all over? Save the Dunning family again? Save Carolyn Poulin again? I had already given nearly two years to this mission. Would I be willing to invest five more, with the outcome as uncertain as ever?</p><p class="calibre13">Better not to have to find out.</p><p class="calibre13">Better to make sure.</p><p class="calibre13">On my way to Texas from New Orleans, I had decided the best way to monitor Oswald without getting in his way would be to live in Dallas while he was in the sister city of Fort Worth, then relocate to Fort Worth when Oswald moved his family to Dallas. The idea had the virtue of simplicity, but it wouldn’t work. I realized that in the weeks after looking at the Texas School Book Depository for the first time and feeling very strongly that it was—like Nietzsche’s abyss—looking back at me.</p><p class="calibre13">I spent August and September of that presidential election year driving the Sunliner around Dallas, apartment-hunting (even after all this time sorely missing my GPS unit and frequently stopping to ask for directions). Nothing seemed right. At first I thought that was about the apartments themselves. Then, as I began to get a better sense of the city, I realized it was about me.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">The simple truth was that I didn’t like Dallas, and eight weeks of hard study was enough to make me believe there was a lot not to like. The <span class="italic">Times Herald</span> (which many Dallas-ites routinely called the <span class="italic">Slimes Herald</span> ) was a tiresome juggernaut of nickel boosterism. The <span class="italic">Morning News</span> might wax lyrical, talking about how Dallas and Houston were “in a race to the heavens,” but the skyscrapers of which the editorial spoke were an island of architectural blah surrounded by rings of what I came to think of as The Great American Flatcult. The newspapers ignored the slum neighborhoods where the divisions along racial lines were just beginning to melt a little. Further out were endless middle-class housing developments, mostly owned by veterans of World War II and Korea. The vets had wives who spent their days Pledging the furniture and Maytagging the clothes. Most had 2.5 children. The teenagers mowed lawns, delivered the <span class="italic">Slimes Herald</span> on bicycles, Turtle Waxed the family car, and listened (furtively) to Chuck Berry on transistor radios. Maybe telling their anxious parents he was white.</p><p class="calibre13">Beyond the suburban houses with their whirling lawn-sprinklers were those vast flat tracts of empty. Here and there rolling irrigators still serviced cotton crops, but mostly King Cotton was dead, replaced by endless acres of corn and soybeans. The real Dallas County crops were electronics, textiles, bullshit, and black money petro-dollars. There weren’t many derricks in the area, but when the wind blew from the west, where the Permian Basin is, the twin cities stank of oil and natural gas.</p><p class="calibre13">The downtown business district was full of sharpies hustling around in what I came to think of as the Full Dallas: checked sport<br class="calibre6"/>coats, narrow neckwear held down with bloated tie clips (these clips, the sixties version of bling, usually came with diamonds or plausible substitutes sparkling in their centers), white Sansabelt pants, and gaudy boots with complex stitching. They worked in banks and investment companies. They sold soybean futures and oil leases and real estate to the west of the city, land where nothing would grow except jimson and tumbleweed. They clapped each other on the shoulders with beringed hands and called each other <span class="italic">son</span>. On their belts, where businessmen in 2011 carry their cell phones, many carried handguns in hand-tooled holsters.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">There were billboards advocating the impeachment of Supreme Court Chief Justice Earl Warren; billboards showing a snarling Nikita Khrushchev (NYET, COMRADE KHRUSHCHEV, the billboard copy read, WE WILL BURY <span class="italic">YOU!</span>); there was one on West Commerce Street that read THE AMERICAN COMMUNIST PARTY FAVORS INTEGRATION. <span class="bold">THINK ABOUT IT!</span> That one had been paid for by something called The Tea Party Society. Twice, on businesses whose names suggested they were Jewish-owned, I saw soaped swastikas.</p><p class="calibre13">I didn’t like Dallas. No sir, no ma’am, no way. I hadn’t liked it from the moment I checked into the Adolphus and saw the restaurant maître d’ gripping a cringing young waiter by the arm and shouting into his face. Nevertheless, my business was here, and here I would stay. That was what I thought then.</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">10</span></span></p><p class="calibre21">On the twenty-second of September, I finally found a place that looked livable. It was on Blackwell Street in North Dallas, a detached garage that had been converted into a pretty nice duplex apartment. Greatest advantage: air-conditioning. Greatest disadvantage: the owner-landlord, Ray Mack Johnson, was a racist who shared with me that if I took the place, it would be wise to stay away from nearby Greenville Avenue, where there were a lot of mixed-race jukejoints and coons with the kind of knives he called “switchers.”</p><p class="calibre13">“I got ary thing in the world against niggers,” he told me. “Nosir. It was God who cursed them to their position, not me. You know that, don’t you?”</p><p class="calibre13">“I guess I missed that part of the Bible.”</p><p class="calibre13">He squinted suspiciously. “What are you, Methodist?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Yes,” I said. It seemed a lot safer than saying I was, denominationally speaking, nothing.</p><p class="calibre13">“You need to get in the Baptist way of churching, son. Ours welcomes newcomers. You take this place, and maybe some Sunday you can come with me n my wife.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Maybe so,” I agreed, reminding myself to be in a coma that Sunday. Possibly dead.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">Mr. Johnson, meanwhile, had returned to his original scripture.</p><p class="calibre13">“You see, Noah got drunk this one time on the Ark, and he was a-layin on his bed, naked as a jaybird. Two of his sons wouldn’t look at him, they just turned the other way and put a blanket over him. I don’t know, it might’ve been a sheet. But Ham—he was the coon of the family—looked on his father in his nakedness, and God cursed him and all his race to be hewers of wood and drawers of water. So there it is. That’s what’s behind it. Genesis, chapter nine. You go on and look it up, Mr. Amberson.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Uh-huh,” I said, telling myself that I had to go <span class="italic">someplace,</span> I couldn’t afford to stay at the Adolphus indefinitely. Telling myself I could live with a little racism, that I wouldn’t melt. Telling myself it was the temper of the times, and it was probably the same just about everywhere. Only I didn’t quite believe it. “I’ll think it over and let you know in a day or two, Mr. Johnson.”</p><p class="calibre13">“You don’t want to wait too long, son. This place will go fast. You have a blessed day, now.”</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">11</span></span></p><p class="calibre21">The blessed day was another scorcher, and apartment-hunting was thirsty work. After leaving Ray Mack Johnson’s learned company, I felt in need of a beer. I decided to get one on Greenville Avenue. If Mr. Johnson discouraged the neighborhood, I thought I ought to check it out.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">He was correct on two counts: the street was integrated (more or less), and it was rough. It was also lively. I parked and strolled, savoring the carny atmosphere. I passed almost two dozen bars, a few second-run movie houses (COME IN IT’S “KOOL” INSIDE, read the banners flapping from the marquees in a hot, oil-smelling Texas wind), and a striptease joint where a streetside barker yelled “Girls, girls, girls, best burley-q in the whole damn world! Best burley-q you’ve ever <span class="italic">seen</span>! These ladies <span class="italic">shave,</span> if you know what I mean!” I also passed three or four check-cashing-and-quickie-loan storefronts. Standing bold as brass in front of one—Faith Financial, Where Trust Is Our Watchword—was a chalkboard with THE DAILY LINE printed at the top and FOR AMUSEMENT ONLY at the bottom. Men in straw hats and suspenders (a look only dedicated punters can pull off) were standing around it, discussing the posted odds. Some had racing forms; some had the <span class="italic">Morning News</span> sports section.</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="italic">For amusement only,</span> I thought. <span class="italic">Yeah, right.</span> For a moment I thought of my beachfront shack burning in the night, the flames pulled high into the starry black by the wind off the Gulf. Amusement had its drawbacks, especially when it came to betting.</p><p class="calibre13">Music and the smell of beer wafted out of open doorways. I heard Jerry Lee Lewis singing “Whole Lotta Shakin’ Goin’ On” from one juke and Ferlin Husky emoting “Wings of a Dove” from the one next door. I was propositioned by four hookers and a sidewalk vendor who was selling hubcaps, rhinestone-glittery straight razors, and Lone Star State flags embossed with the words DON’T MESS WITH TEXAS. Try translating that one into Latin.</p><p class="calibre13">That troubling sense of déjà vu was very strong, that feeling that things were wrong here just as they had been wrong before. Which was crazy—I’d never been on Greenville Avenue in my life—but it was also undeniable, a thing of the heart rather than the head. All at once I decided I didn’t want a beer. And I didn’t want to rent Mr. Johnson’s converted garage, either, no matter how good the air-conditioning was.</p><p class="calibre13">I had just passed a watering hole called the Desert Rose, where the Rock-Ola was blasting Muddy Waters. As I turned to start back to where my car was parked, a man came flying out the door. He stumbled and went sprawling on the sidewalk. There was a burst of laughter from the bar’s dark interior. A woman yelled, “And don’t come back, you dickless wonder!” This produced more (and heartier) laughter.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">The ejected patron was bleeding from the nose—which was bent severely to one side—and also from a scrape that ran down the left side of his face from temple to jawline. His eyes were huge and shocked. His untucked shirt flapped almost to his knees as he grabbed a lamppost and pulled himself to his feet. Once on them, he glared around at everything, seeing nothing.</p><p class="calibre13">I took a step or two toward him, but before I could get there, one of the women who’d asked me if I’d like a date came swaying up on stiletto heels. Only she wasn’t a woman, not really. She couldn’t have been more than sixteen, with large dark eyes and smooth coffee-colored skin. She was smiling, but not in a mean way, and when the man with the bloody face staggered, she took his arm. “Easy, sweetheart,” she said. “You need to settle down before you—”</p><p class="calibre13">He raked up the hanging tails of his shirt. The pearl-handled grip of a pistol—much smaller than the one I’d bought at Machen’s Sporting Goods, really not much more than a toy—lay against the pale fat hanging over the beltless waistband of his gabardine slacks. His fly was half-unzipped and I could see boxer shorts with red racing cars on them. I remember that. He pulled the gun, pressed the muzzle against the streetwalker’s midriff, and pulled the trigger. There was a stupid little pop, the sound of a ladyfinger firecracker going off in a tin can, no more than that. The woman screamed and sat down on the sidewalk with her hands laced over her belly.</p><p class="calibre13">“You <span class="italic">shot</span> me!” She sounded more outraged than hurt, but blood had begun to spill through her fingers. “You <span class="italic">shot</span> me, you pissant bugger, why did you <span class="italic">shoot</span> me?”</p><p class="calibre13">He took no notice, only yanked open the door of the Desert Rose. I was still standing where I’d been when he shot the pretty young hooker, partly because I was frozen by shock, but mostly because all of this happened in a matter of seconds. Longer than it would take Oswald to kill the President of the United States, maybe, but not much.</p><p class="calibre13">“Is this what you want, Linda?” he shouted. “If this is what you want, I’ll give you what you want!”</p><p class="calibre13">He put the muzzle of the gun into his ear and pulled the trigger.</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">12</span></span></p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre21">I folded my handkerchief and pressed it gently over the hole in the young girl’s red dress. I don’t know how badly she was hurt, but she was lively enough to produce a steady stream of colorful phrases she had probably not learned from her mother (on the other hand, who knows). And when one man in the gathering crowd moved a little too close to suit her, she snarled: “Quit lookin up my dress, you nosy bastard. For that you pay.”</p><p class="calibre13">“This pore ole sumbitch here is dead as can be,” someone remarked. He was kneeling beside the man who had been thrown out of the Desert Rose. A woman began to shriek.</p><p class="calibre13">Approaching sirens: they were shrieking, too. I noticed one of the other ladies who had approached me during my stroll down Greenville Avenue, a redhead in capri pants. I beckoned to her. She touched her chest in a <span class="italic">who, me?</span> gesture, and I nodded. Yes, you. “Hold this handkerchief on the wound,” I told her. “Try to stop the bleeding. I’ve got to go.”</p><p class="calibre13">She gave me a wise little smile. “Don’t want to hang around for the cops?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Not really. I don’t know any of these people. I was just passing by.”</p><p class="calibre13">The redhead knelt by the bleeding, cursing girl on the sidewalk, and pressed down on the sodden handkerchief. “Honey,” she said, “aren’t we all.”</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">13</span></span></p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre21">I couldn’t sleep that night. I’d start to drift, then see Ray Mack Johnson’s sweat-oily, complacent face as he blamed two thousand years of slavery, murder, and exploitation on some teenage kid eyeballing his father’s gearshift. I’d jerk awake, settle back, drift . . . and see the little man with the unzipped fly sticking the muzzle of his hideout gun in his ear. <span class="italic">Is this what you want, Linda?</span> One final burst of petulance before the big sleep. And I’d start awake again. Next time it was men in a black sedan throwing a gasoline bomb through the front window of my place on Sunset Point: Eduardo Gutierrez attempting to get rid of his Yanqui from Yankeeland. Why? Because he didn’t like to lose big, that was all. For him, that was enough.</p><p class="calibre13">Finally I gave up and sat down by the window, where the hotel air-conditioner was rattling gamely away. In Maine the night would be crisp enough to start bringing color to the trees, but here in Dallas it was still seventy-five at two-thirty in the morning. And humid.</p><p class="calibre13">“Dallas, Derry,” I said as I looked down into the silent ditch of Commerce Street. The brick cube of the Book Depository wasn’t visible, but it was close by. Walking distance.</p><p class="calibre13">“Derry, Dallas.”</p><p class="calibre13">Each name comprised of two syllables that broke on the double letter like a stick of kindling over a bent knee. I couldn’t stay here. Another thirty months in Big D would send me crazy. How long would it be before I started seeing graffiti like I WILL KILL MY MOTHER SOON? Or glimpsed a juju Jesus floating down the Trinity River? Fort Worth might be better, but Fort Worth was still too close.</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="italic">Why do I have to stay in either?</span></p><p class="calibre13">This thought came to me shortly after 3:00 <span class="calibre22">A.M.</span>, and with the force of a revelation. I had a fine car—a car I’d sort of fallen in love with, to tell you the truth—and there was no shortage of good fast roads in central Texas, many of them recently built. By the turn of the twenty-first century, they would probably be choked with traffic, but in 1960 they were almost eerily deserted. There were speed limits, but they weren’t enforced. In Texas, even the state cops were believers in the gospel of put the pedal to the metal and let er bellow.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">I could move out from beneath the suffocating shadow I felt over this city. I could find a place that was smaller and less daunting, a place that didn’t feel so filled with hate and violence. In broad daylight I could tell myself I was imagining those things, but not in the ditch of the morning. There were undoubtedly good people in Dallas, thousands upon thousands of them, the great majority, but that underchord was there, and sometimes it broke out. As it had outside the Desert Rose.</p><p class="calibre13">Bevvie-from-the-levee had said that <span class="italic">In Derry I think the bad times are over.</span> I wasn’t convinced about Derry, and I felt the same way about Dallas, even with its worst day still over three years away.</p><p class="calibre13">“I’ll commute,” I said. “George wants a nice quiet place to work on his book, but since the book is about a city—a <span class="italic">haunted</span> city—he really has to commute, doesn’t he? To get material.”</p><p class="calibre13">It was no wonder it took me almost two months to think of this; life’s simplest answers are often the easiest to overlook. I went back to bed and fell asleep almost at once.</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">14</span></span></p><p class="calibre21">The next day I drove south out of Dallas on Highway 77. An hour and a half took me into Denholm County. I turned west onto State Road 109 mostly because I liked the billboard marking the intersection. It showcased a heroic young football player wearing a gold helmet, black jersey, and gold leggings. DENHOLM LIONS, the billboard proclaimed. 3-TIME DISTRICT CHAMPS! STATE CHAMPIONSHIP BOUND IN 1960! “WE’VE GOT JIM POWER!”</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="italic">Whatever that is,</span> I thought. But of course every high school has its secret signs and signals; it’s what makes kids feel like they’re on the inside.</p><p class="calibre13">Five miles up Highway 109, I came to the town of Jodie. POP. 1280, the sign said. WELCOME, STRANGER! Halfway up the wide, tree-lined Main Street I saw a little restaurant with a sign in the window reading BEST SHAKES, FRIES, AND BURGERS IN ALL OF TEXAS! It was called Al’s Diner.</p><p class="calibre13">Of course it was.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">I parked in one of the slant spaces out front, went in, and ordered the Pronghorn Special, which turned out to be a double cheeseburger with barbecue sauce. It came with Mesquite Fries and a Rodeo Thickshake—your choice of vanilla, chocolate, or strawberry. A Pronghorn wasn’t quite as good as a Fatburger, but it wasn’t bad, and the fries were just the way I like them: crispy, salty, and a little overdone.</p><p class="calibre13">Al turned out to be Al Stevens, a skinny middle-aged guy who looked nothing like Al Templeton. He had a rockabilly hairdo, a gray-streaked bandido mustache, a thick Texas drawl, and a paper hat worn jauntily cocked over one eye. When I asked him if there was much to rent in the town of Jodie, he laughed and said, “Take your pick. But when it comes to jobs, this ain’t exactly a center of commerce. Ranchland, mostly, and you’ll pardon me sayin, but you don’t look like the cowboy type.”</p><p class="calibre13">“I’m not,” I said. “Actually, I’m more the book-writing type.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Get out! Anything I might have read?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Not yet,” I said. “I’m still trying. I’ve got about half of a novel written, and a couple of publishers have shown some interest. I’m looking for a quiet place to finish.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Well, Jodie’s quiet, all right.” Al rolled his eyes. “When it comes to quiet, I reckon we could take out a patent. Only gets noisy on Friday nights.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Football?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Yessir, whole town goes. Halftime comes, they all roar like lions, then give out with the Jim Yell. You can hear em two miles away. It’s pretty comical.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Who’s Jim?”</p><p class="calibre13">“LaDue, the quarterback. We’ve had us some good teams, but ain’t never been a QB like LaDue on a Denholm team. And he’s only a junior. People been talkin ’bout the state championship. That seems a tad optimistic to me, with those big Dallas schools just up the road, but a little hope never hurt anybody, that’s what I reckon.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Football aside, how’s the school?”</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">“It’s real fine. Lot of people were doubtful about this consolidation thing at first—I was one of em—but it’s turned out to be a good thing. They got over seven hunnerd this year. Some of em bus in an hour or more, but they don’t seem to mind. Probably saves em chores at home. Is your book about high school kids? <span class="italic">Blackboard Jungle</span> kind of thing? Because there ain’t no gangs or anything out here. Out here kids still mind their manners.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Nothing like that. I’ve got savings, but I wouldn’t mind stretching what I’ve got with some substitute work. I can’t teach full-time and still write.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Course not,” he said respectfully.</p><p class="calibre13">“My degree’s from Oklahoma, but . . .” I shrugged to show Oklahoma wasn’t in Texas’s league, but a man could hope.</p><p class="calibre13">“Well, you ought to talk to Deke Simmons. He’s the principal. Comes in for dinner most evenins. His wife died a couple of years back.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Sorry to hear that,” I said.</p><p class="calibre13">“We all were. He’s a nice man. Most people are in these parts, Mr.—?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Amberson. George Amberson.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Well, George, we’re pretty sleepy, except on Friday nights, but you could do worse. Might could even learn to roar like a lion at halftime.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Maybe I could,” I said.</p><p class="calibre13">“You come on back around six. That’s usually the time Deke comes in.” He put his arms on the counter and leaned over them. “Want a tip?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Sure.”</p><p class="calibre13">“He’ll probably have his lady-friend with him. Miss Corcoran, the librarian up to the school. He’s kinda been sparkin her since last Christmas or so. I’ve heard that Mimi Corcoran’s the one who <span class="italic">really</span> runs Denholm Consolidated, because she runs <span class="italic">him.</span> If you impress her, I reckon you’re in like Flynn.”</p><p class="calibre13">“I’ll keep that in mind,” I said.</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">15</span></span></p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre21">Weeks of apartment-hunting in Dallas had netted me exactly one possible, which turned out to be owned by a man I didn’t want to rent from. It took me three hours in Jodie to find a place that looked fine. Not an apartment, but a tidy little five-room shotgun house. It was for sale, the real estate agent told me, but the couple who owned it would be willing to rent to the right party. There was an elm-shaded backyard, a garage for the Sunliner . . . and central air-conditioning. The rent was reasonable, given the amenities.</p><p class="calibre13">Freddy Quinlan was the agent’s name. He was curious about me—I think the Maine license plate on my car struck him as exotic—but not unduly so. Best of all, I felt I was out from under the shadow that had lain over me in Dallas, Derry, and Sunset Point, where my last long-term rental now lay in ashes.</p><p class="calibre13">“Well?” Quinlan asked. “What do you think?”</p><p class="calibre13">“I want it, but I can’t give you a yes or no this afternoon. I have to see a fellow first. I don’t suppose you’ll be open tomorrow, will you?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Yessir, I will. Saturdays I’m open until noon. Then I go home and watch the Game of the Week on TV. Looks like it could be a heck of a Series this year.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Yes,” I said. “It certainly does.”</p><p class="calibre13">Quinlan extended his hand. “It was nice meeting you, Mr. Amberson. I bet you’d like Jodie. We’re good people around here. Hope it works out for you.”</p><p class="calibre13">I shook with him. “So do I.”</p><p class="calibre13">Like the man said, a little hope never hurt anybody.</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">16</span></span></p><p class="calibre21">That evening I returned to Al’s Diner and introduced myself to the principal of Denholm Consolidated and his librarian lady-friend. They invited me to join them.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">Deke Simmons was tall, bald, and sixtyish. Mimi Corcoran was bespectacled and tanned. The blue eyes behind her bifocals were sharp, looking me up and down for clues. She walked with the aid of a cane, handling it with the careless (almost contemptuous) dexterity of long use. Both of them, I was amused to see, were carrying Denholm pennants and wearing gold buttons that read WE’VE GOT JIM POWER! It was Friday night in Texas.</p><p class="calibre13">Simmons asked me how I was liking Jodie (a lot), how long I’d been in Dallas (since August), and if I enjoyed high school football (yes indeed). The closest he got to anything substantive was asking me if I felt confident in my ability to make kids “mind.” Because, he said, a lot of substitutes had a problem with that.</p><p class="calibre13">“These young teachers send em to us in the office like we didn’t have anything better to do,” he said, and then chomped his Pronghorn Burger.</p><p class="calibre13">“Sauce, Deke,” Mimi said, and he obediently wiped the corner of his mouth with a paper napkin from the dispenser.</p><p class="calibre13">She, meanwhile, was continuing her inventory of me: sport coat, tie, haircut. The shoes she’d taken a good look at as I crossed to their booth. “Do you have references, Mr. Amberson?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Yes, ma’am, I did quite a bit of substitute teaching in Sarasota County.”</p><p class="calibre13">“And in Maine?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Not so much there, although I taught for three years in Wisconsin on a regular basis before quitting to work full-time on my book. Or as much full-time as my finances would allow.” I <span class="italic">did</span> have a reference from St. Vincent’s High School, in Madison. It was a good reference; I had written it myself. Of course, if anyone checked back, I’d be hung. Deke Simmons wouldn’t do it, but sharp-eyed Mimi with the leathery cowboy skin might.</p><p class="calibre13">“And what is your novel about?”</p><p class="calibre13">This might also hang me, but I decided to be honest. As honest as possible, anyway, given my peculiar circumstances. “A series of murders, and their effect on the community where they happen.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Oh my goodness,” Deke said.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">She tapped his wrist. “Hush. Go on, Mr. Amberson.”</p><p class="calibre13">“My original setting was a fictional Maine city—I called it Dawson—but then I decided it might be more realistic if I set it in an <span class="italic">actual</span> city. A bigger one. I thought Tampa, at first, but it was wrong, somehow—”</p><p class="calibre13">She waved Tampa away. “Too pastel. Too many tourists. You were looking for something a little more insular, I suspect.”</p><p class="calibre13">A very sharp lady. She knew more about my book than I did.</p><p class="calibre13">“That’s right. So I decided to try Dallas. I think it’s the right place, but . . .”</p><p class="calibre13">“But you wouldn’t want to live there?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Exactly.”</p><p class="calibre13">“I see.” She picked at her piece of deep-fried fish. Deke was looking at her with a mildly poleaxed expression. Whatever it was he wanted as he went cantering down the backstretch of life, she appeared to have it. Not so strange; everybody loves somebody sometime, as Dean Martin would so wisely point out. But not for another few years. “And when you’re not writing, what do you like to read, Mr. Amberson?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Oh, just about everything.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Have you read <span class="italic">The Catcher in the Rye</span>?”</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="italic">Uh-oh,</span> I thought.</p><p class="calibre13">“Yes, ma’am.”</p><p class="calibre13">She looked impatient at this. “Oh, call me Mimi. Even the kids call me Mimi, although I insist they put a Miz with it for propriety’s sake. What do you think of Mr. Salinger’s cri de coeur?”</p><p class="calibre13">Lie, or tell the truth? But it wasn’t a serious question. This woman would read a lie the way I could read . . . well . . . an IMPEACH EARL WARREN billboard.</p><p class="calibre13">“I think it says a lot about how lousy the fifties were, and a lot about how good the sixties can be. If the Holden Caulfields of America don’t lose their outrage, that is. And their courage.”</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">“Um. Hum.” Picking plenty at her fish, but not eating any that I could see. No wonder she looked like you could staple a string to the back of her dress and fly her like a kite. “Do you believe it should be in the school library?”</p><p class="calibre13">I sighed, thinking how much I would have enjoyed living and teaching part-time in the town of Jodie, Texas. “Actually, ma’am—Mimi—I do. Although I believe it should be checked out only to certain students, and at the librarian’s discretion.”</p><p class="calibre13">“The librarian’s? Not the parents’?”</p><p class="calibre13">“No, ma’am. That’s a slippery slope.”</p><p class="calibre13">Mimi Corcoran burst into a wide smile and turned to her beau. “Deke, this fellow doesn’t belong on the substitute list. He should be full-time.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Mimi—”</p><p class="calibre13">“I know, no vacancy in the English Department. But if he sticks around, maybe he can step in after that idiot Phil Bateman retires.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Meems, that is very indiscreet.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Yes,” she said, and actually dropped me a wink. “Also very true. Send Deke your references from Florida, Mr. Amberson. They should do nicely. Better yet, bring them in yourself, next week. The school year has started. No sense in losing time.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Call me George,” I said.</p><p class="calibre13">“Yes, indeed,” she said. She pushed her plate away. “Deke, this is <span class="italic">terrible.</span> Why do we eat here?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Because I like the burgers and you like Al’s strawberry shortcake.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Oh, yes,” she said. “The strawberry shortcake. Bring it on. Mr. Amberson, can you stay for the football game?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Not tonight,” I said. “I’ve got to get back to Dallas. Maybe next week’s game. If you think you can use me.”</p><p class="calibre13">“If Mimi likes you, I like you,” Deke Simmons said. “I can’t guarantee you a day every week, but some weeks there’ll be two or even three. It will all average out.”</p><p class="calibre13">“I’m sure it will.”</p><p class="calibre13">“The substitute salary isn’t much, I’m afraid—”</p><p class="calibre13">“I know that, sir. I’m just looking for a way to supplement my income.”</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">“That <span class="italic">Catcher</span> book will never be in our library,” Deke said with a regretful side-glance at his purse-lipped paramour. “Schoolboard won’t have it. Mimi knows that.” Another big bite of his Prongburger.</p><p class="calibre13">“Times change,” Mimi Corcoran said, pointing first to the napkin dispenser and then to the side of his mouth. “Deke. Sauce.”</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">17</span></span></p><p class="calibre21">The following week I made a mistake. I should have known better; making another major wager should have been the last thing on my mind after all that had happened to me. You’ll say I should have been more on my guard.</p><p class="calibre13">I <span class="italic">did</span> understand the risk, but I was worried about money. I had come to Texas with something less than sixteen thousand dollars. Some was the remainder of Al’s stake-money, but most of it was the result of two very large bets, one placed in Derry and one in Tampa. But staying at the Adolphus for seven weeks or so had eaten up over a thousand; getting settled in a new town would easily cost another four or five hundred. Food, rent, and utilities aside, I was going to need a lot more clothes—and better ones—if I was going to look respectable in a classroom. I’d be based in Jodie for two and a half years before I could conclude my business with Lee Harvey Oswald. Fourteen thousand dollars or so wasn’t going to cut it. The substitute teaching salary? Fifteen dollars and fifty cents a day. Yeehaw.</p><p class="calibre13">Okay, maybe I <span class="italic">could</span> have scraped through on fourteen grand, plus thirty and sometimes even fifty bucks a week as a sub. But I’d have to stay healthy and not have any accidents, and I couldn’t bank on that. Because the past is sly as well as obdurate. It fights back. And yes, maybe there was an element of greed involved, too. If so, it was based less on the love of money than on the intoxicating knowledge that I could beat the usually unbeatable house whenever I wanted to.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">I think now: <span class="italic">If Al had researched the stock market as thoroughly as who won all those baseball games, football games, and horse races . . .</span></p><p class="calibre13">But he didn’t.</p><p class="calibre13">I think now: <span class="italic">If Freddy Quinlan hadn’t mentioned that the World Series was shaping up to be a doozy . . .</span></p><p class="calibre13">But he did.</p><p class="calibre13">And I went back to Greenville Avenue.</p><p class="calibre13">I told myself that all those straw-hatted punters I’d seen standing out in front of Faith Financial (Where Trust Is Our Watchword) would be betting the Series, and some of them would be laying down serious cash. I told myself that I’d be one among many, and a middling bet from Mr. George Amberson—who’d claim to be living in a nice converted-garage duplex on Blackwell Street right here in Dallas, should anyone inquire—would attract no attention. Hell, I told myself, the guys running Faith Financial probably don’t know Señor Eduardo Gutierrez of Tampa from Adam. Or from Noah’s son, Ham, for that matter.</p><p class="calibre13">Oh, I told myself lots of things, and they all boiled down to the same two things: that it was perfectly safe, and that it was perfectly reasonable to want more money even though I currently had enough to live on. Dumb. But stupidity is one of two things we see most clearly in retrospect. The other is missed chances.</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">18</span></span></p><p class="calibre21">On September twenty-eighth, a week before the Series was scheduled to start, I walked into Faith Financial and—after some dancing—put down six hundred dollars on the Pittsburgh Pirates to beat the Yankees in seven. I accepted two-to-one odds, which was outrageous considering how heavily favored the Yankees were. On the day after Bill Mazeroski hit his unlikely ninth-inning home run to seal the deal for the Buckos, I drove back to Dallas and Greenville Avenue. I think that if Faith Financial had been deserted, I would have turned around and driven right <span class="italic">back</span> to Jodie . . . or maybe that’s just what I tell myself now. I don’t know for sure.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">What I <span class="italic">do</span> know is there was a queue of bettors waiting to collect, and I joined it. That group was a Martin Luther King dream come true: fifty percent black, fifty percent white, a hundred percent happy. Most guys came out with nothing but a few fives or maybe a double sawbuck or two, but I saw several who were counting C-notes. An armed robber who had chosen that day to hit Faith Financial would have done well, indeed.</p><p class="calibre13">The money-man was a stocky fellow wearing a green eyeshade. He asked me the standard first question (“Are you a cop? If you are, you have to show me your ID”), and when I answered in the negative, he asked for my name and a look at my driver’s license. It was a brand-new one, which I had received by registered mail the week before; finally a piece of Texas identification to add to my collection. And I was careful to hold my thumb over the Jodie address.</p><p class="calibre13">He paid me my twelve hundred. I stuffed it in my pocket and walked quickly to my car. When I was back on Highway 77, with Dallas falling behind and Jodie growing closer with every turn of the wheels, I finally relaxed.</p><p class="calibre13">Stupid me.</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">19</span></span></p><p class="calibre21">We’re going to take another leap forward in time (narratives also contain rabbit-holes, when you stop to think of it), but I need to recount one more thing from 1960, first.</p><p class="calibre13">Fort Worth. November sixteenth, 1960. Kennedy the president-elect for a little over a week. The corner of Ballinger and West Seventh. The day was cold and overcast. Cars puffed white exhaust. The weatherman on KLIF (“All the hits, all the time”) was forecasting rain that might thicken to sleet by midnight, so be careful on the highways, all you rockers and rollers.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">I was bundled into a rawhide ranch coat; a felt cap with flaps was jammed down over my ears. I was sitting on a bench in front of the Texas Cattle Raisers’ Association, looking down West Seventh. I had been there for almost an hour, and I didn’t think the young man would visit with his mother much longer than that; according to Al Templeton’s notes, all three of her boys had gotten away from her as soon as they possibly could. What I was hoping was that she might come out of her apartment building with him. She was recently back in the area after several months in Waco, where she had been working as a ladies’ home companion.</p><p class="calibre13">My patience was rewarded. The door of the Rotary Apartments opened and a skinny man who bore an eerie resemblance to Lee Harvey Oswald came out. He held the door for a woman in a tartan car coat and blocky white nurse’s shoes. She was only shoulder-high to him, but solidly built. Her graying hair was scrooped back from a prematurely lined face. She wore a red kerchief. Matching lipstick outlined a small mouth that looked dissatisfied and pugnacious—the mouth of a woman who believes the world is against her and has had plenty of evidence over the years to prove it. Lee Oswald’s elder brother went quickly down the concrete path. The woman scurried after and grabbed the back of his topcoat. He turned to her on the sidewalk. They appeared to argue, but the woman did most of the talking. She shook her finger in his face. No way I could tell what she was scolding him about; I was a prudent block and a half away. Then he started toward the corner of West Seventh and Summit Avenue, as I had expected. He had come by bus, and that was where the nearest stop was.</p><p class="calibre13">The woman stood where she was for a moment, as if undecided. <span class="italic">Come on, Mama,</span> I thought, <span class="italic">you’re not going to let him get away that easily, are you? He’s just half a block down the street. Lee had to go all the way to Russia to get away from that wagging finger.</span></p><p class="calibre13">She went after him, and as they neared the corner, she raised her voice and I heard her clearly. “<span class="italic">Stop,</span> Robert, don’t walk so fast, I’m not done with you!”</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">He looked over his shoulder but kept walking. She caught up to him at the bus stop and tugged on his sleeve until he looked at her. The finger resumed its tick-tock wagging. I caught isolated phrases: <span class="italic">you promised,</span> and <span class="italic">gave you everything</span> and—I think—<span class="italic">who are you to judge me.</span> I couldn’t see Oswald’s face because his back was to me, but his slumped shoulders said plenty. I doubted if this was the first time Mama had followed him down the street, jabbering away the whole time, oblivious of spectators. She spread a hand above the shelf of her bosom, that timeless Mom-gesture that says <span class="italic">Behold me, ye thankless child.</span></p><p class="calibre13">Oswald dug into his back pocket, produced his wallet, and gave her a bill. She stuffed it in her purse without looking at it and started back toward the Rotary Apartments. Then she thought of something else and turned to him once more. I heard her clearly. Raised to shout across the fifteen or twenty yards now between them, that reedy voice was like fingernails drawn down a slate blackboard.</p><p class="calibre13">“And call me if you hear from Lee again, hear? I’m still on the party line, it’s all I can afford until I get a better job, and that Sykes woman from downstairs is on it <span class="italic">all the time,</span> I spoke to her, I gave her a real piece of my mind, ‘Mrs. Sykes,’ I said—”</p><p class="calibre13">A man passed her. He stuck a theatrical finger in one ear, grinning. If Mama saw, she took no notice. She certainly took no notice of her son’s grimace of embarrassment.</p><p class="calibre13">“‘Mrs. Sykes,’ I said, ‘you’re not the only one who needs the phone, so I’d thank you to keep your calls <span class="italic">short.</span> And if you won’t do it on your own, I may have to call a representative of the telephone company to <span class="italic">make</span> you do it.’ That’s what I said. So you call me, Rob. You know I need to hear from Lee.”</p><p class="calibre13">Here came the bus. As it pulled up, he raised his voice to be heard over the chuff of the air-brakes. “He’s a damn Commie, Ma, and he’s not coming home. Get used to it.”</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13"><span class="italic">“You call me!”</span> she shrilled. Her grim little face was set. She stood with her feet planted apart, like a boxer ready to absorb a blow. Any blow. Every blow. Her eyes glared from behind black-rimmed harlequin glasses. Her kerchief was double-knotted beneath her chin. The rain had begun to fall now, but she paid it no mind. She drew in breath and raised her voice to something just short of a scream. <span class="italic">“I need to hear from my good boy, you hear?”</span></p><p class="calibre13">Robert Oswald bolted up the steps and into the bus without replying. It pulled away in a chuff of blue exhaust. And as it did, a smile lit her face. It did something of which I would have thought a smile incapable: it made her simultaneously younger and uglier.</p><p class="calibre13">A workman passed her. He didn’t bump or even brush her, as far as I could see, but she snapped: “Watch where you’re going! You don’t own the sidewalk!”</p><p class="calibre13">Marguerite Oswald started back toward her apartment. When she turned away from me, she was still smiling.</p><p class="calibre13">I drove back to Jodie that afternoon, shaken and thoughtful. I wouldn’t see Lee Oswald for another year and a half, and I remained determined to stop him, but I already felt more sympathy for him than I ever had for Frank Dunning.</p><div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_26"></div></body>
