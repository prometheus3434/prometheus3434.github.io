<p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">CHAPTER 18</span></span></p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">1</span></span></p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre21">I got a phone put in, and the first person I called was Ellen Dockerty, who was happy to give me Sadie’s Reno address. “I have the telephone number of the rooming house where she’s staying, too,” Ellen said. “If you want it.”</p><p class="calibre13">Of course I did, but if I had it, I would eventually give in to temptation and call. Something told me that would be a mistake.</p><p class="calibre13">“Just the address will be fine.”</p><p class="calibre13">I wrote her a letter as soon as I hung up, hating the stilted, artificially chatty tone but not knowing how to get past it. The goddam broom was still between us. And what if she met some high-rolling sugar daddy out there and forgot all about me? Wasn’t it possible? She’d certainly know how to give him a good time in bed; she had been a fast learner and was as agile there as she was on the dance floor. That was the jealous-bone again, and I finished the letter in a rush, knowing I probably sounded plaintive and not caring. Anything to tear through the artificiality and say something honest.</p><blockquote class="calibre24"><span class="italic">I miss you, and I’m sorry as hell for the way we left things. I just don’t know how to make it better now. I have a job to do, and it won’t be done until next spring. Maybe not even then, but I think it will be. I hope it will be. Please don’t forget me. I love you, Sadie.</span></blockquote><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">I signed it George, which seemed to cancel out any poor honesty I’d managed. Beneath it I added <span class="italic">Just in case you want to call,</span> and my new telephone number. Then I walked down to the Benbrook Library and posted the letter into the big blue mailbox out front. For the time being it was the best I could do.</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">2</span></span></p><p class="calibre21">There were three pictures clipped into Al’s notebook, printed off various computer sites. One was of George de Mohrenschildt, wearing a banker-gray suit with a white hankie in the breast pocket. His hair was combed away from his brow and neatly parted in the accepted executive style of the time. The smile that creased his thickish lips reminded me of Baby Bear’s bed: not too hard, not too soft, just right. There was no trace of the authentic crazy I would soon observe ripping his shirt open on the porch of 2703 Mercedes Street. Or maybe there <span class="italic">was</span> a trace. Something in the dark eyes. An arrogance. A touch of the old fuck-you.</p><p class="calibre13">The second picture was of the infamous shooter’s nest, constructed of book cartons, on the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository.</p><p class="calibre13">The third was of Oswald, dressed in black, holding his mail-order rifle in one hand and a couple of leftist magazines in the other. The revolver he would use to kill Dallas police officer J. D. Tippit during his fucked-up getaway—unless I stopped him—was tucked in Ozzie’s belt. This picture would be taken by Marina less than two weeks before the attempt on General Walker’s life. The location was the enclosed side yard of a two-apartment building at 214 West Neely Street in Dallas.</p><p class="calibre13">While I marked time waiting for the Oswalds to move into the shack across the street from mine in Fort Worth, I visited 214 West Neely often. Dallas most assuredly sucked the big one, as my 2011 students were wont to say, but West Neely was in a slightly better neighborhood than Mercedes Street. It stank, of course—in 1962, most of central Texas smells like a malfunctioning refinery—but the odors of shit and sewage were absent. The street was crumbling but paved. And there were no chickens.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">A young couple with three children currently lived upstairs at 214. After they moved out, the Oswalds would move in. It was the downstairs apartment that concerned me, because when Lee, Marina, and June moved in above, I wanted to be below.</p><p class="calibre13">In July of ’62, the ground-floor apartment was occupied by two women and a man. The women were fat, slow-moving, and partial to wrinkled sleeveless dresses. One was in her sixties and walked with a pronounced limp. The other was in her late thirties or early forties. The facial resemblance pegged them as mother and daughter. The man was skeletal and wheelchair-bound. His hair was a thin white spray. A bag of cloudy pee attached to a fat catheter tube sat in his lap. He smoked constantly, tapping into an ashtray clamped to one of the wheelchair armrests. That summer I always saw him dressed in the same clothes: red satin basketball shorts that showed his wasted thighs almost to the crotch, a strap-style tee-shirt nearly as yellow as the urine in his catheter tube, sneakers held together by duct tape, and a large black cowboy hat with what appeared to be a snakeskin band. On the front of the hat were crossed cavalry swords. Either his wife or his daughter would push him out onto the lawn, where he would sit slumped beneath a tree, still as a statue. I began to lift my hand to him as I cruised slowly by, but he never raised his own in turn, although he came to recognize my car. Maybe he was afraid to return my wave. Maybe he thought he was being evaluated by the Angel of Death, who made his rounds in Dallas behind the wheel of an aging Ford convertible instead of on a black horse. In a way, I suppose that’s what I was.</p><p class="calibre13">This trio looked like they’d been in residence awhile. Were they still going to be in residence next year, when I needed the place? I didn’t know. Al’s notes said nothing about them. For the time being, all I could do was watch and wait.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">I picked up my new piece of equipment, which Silent Mike had crafted himself. I waited for my telephone to ring. Three times it did, and I leaped for it each time, hoping. Twice it was Miz Ellie, calling to chat. Once it was Deke, inviting me to dinner, an invitation I accepted gratefully.</p><p class="calibre13">Sadie didn’t call.</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">3</span></span></p><p class="calibre21">On the third of August, a ’58 Bel Air sedan pulled into 2703’s excuse for a driveway. It was followed by a gleaming Chrysler. The Oswald brothers got out of the Bel Air and stood side by side, not talking.</p><p class="calibre13">I reached through the drapes long enough to run up my front window, letting in the street noise and a lackluster puff of hot, humid air. Then I ran for the bedroom and brought my new piece of equipment out from under the bed. Silent Mike had cut a hole in the bottom of a Tupperware bowl and taped the omnidirectional mike—which he assured me was top-of-the-line—into it, so it stuck up like a finger. I attached the microphone leads to the connecting points on the back of the tape recorder. There was a plug-in for headphones, which my electronics pal had also claimed were top-of-the-line.</p><p class="calibre13">I peered out and saw the Oswalds talking to the guy from the Chrysler. He was wearing a Stetson, a rancher’s tie, and gaudy stitched boots. Better dressed than my landlord, but of the same tribe. I didn’t have to hear the conversation; the man’s gestures were textbook. <span class="italic">I know it ain’t much, but then, you ain’t</span> got <span class="italic">much. Do you, podna?</span> It had to be a hard scripture for a world traveler like Lee, who believed he was destined for fame, if not necessarily fortune.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">There was an electrical socket in the baseboard. I plugged in the tape recorder, hoping I wouldn’t give myself a shock or blow a fuse. The tape recorder’s little red light went on. I donned the earphones and slipped the Tupperware bowl into the gap between the curtains. If they looked over here they’d be squinting into the sun, and thanks to the shadow cast by the eave above the window, they would see either nothing or an unremarkable white blur that might be anything. I reminded myself to cover the bowl with black friction tape, nevertheless. Always safe, never sorry.</p><p class="calibre13">And in any case, I could hear nothing.</p><p class="calibre13">Even the street sounds had become muffled.</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="italic">Oh yeah, this is great,</span> I thought. <span class="italic">This is just fucking brilliant. Thanks a pantload, Silent Mi—</span></p><p class="calibre13">Then I noticed the VOL control on the tape recorder was sitting at zero. I twisted it all the way to the <span class="bold">+</span> mark, and was <span class="italic">blasted</span> by voices. I tore the earphones off my head with a curse, turned the VOL knob to the halfway point, and tried again. The result was remarkable. Like binoculars for the ears.</p><p class="calibre13">“Sixty a month strikes me as a little bit steep, sir,” Lee Oswald was saying (considering the Templetons had been paying ten dollars a month less, it struck me that way, too). His voice was respectful, tinged by just a trace of Southern accent. “If we could agree on fifty-five . . .”</p><p class="calibre13">“I can respect a man who wants to dicker, but don’t even bother trine,” Snakeskin Boots said. He rocked back and forth on his stacked heels like a man who’s anxious to be gone. “I gotta git what I gotta git. If I don’t git it from you, I’m goan git it from someone else.”</p><p class="calibre13">Lee and Robert glanced at each other.</p><p class="calibre13">“Might as well go in and have a look around,” Lee said.</p><p class="calibre13">“This a good place on a fam’ly street,” Snakeskin Boots said. “Y’all want to watch out for that first porch step, though, it needs a smidge of carpenterin. I got s’many of these places, and people is s’hard on them. That last bunch, law.”</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="italic">Watch it, asshole,</span> I thought. <span class="italic">That’s Ivy’s people you’re talking about.</span></p><p class="calibre13">They went inside. I lost the voices, then got them again—faintly—when Snakeskin Boots ran up the front room window. It was the one Ivy had said the neighbors across the way could see into, and she was a hundred percent correct on that score.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">Lee asked what his prospective landlord intended to do about the holes in the walls. There was no indignation in the query, no sarcasm, but no subservience, either, in spite of the <span class="italic">sir</span> appended to every sentence. It was a respectful yet flat mode of address he had probably learned in the Marines. <span class="italic">Colorless</span> was the best word for him. He had the face and voice of a man who was good at sliding through the cracks. In public, at least. It was Marina who saw his other face and heard his other voice.</p><p class="calibre13">Snakeskin Boots made vague promises, and absolutely guaranteed a new mattress for the big bedroom, on account of how “that last bunch had gone and stole” the one that had been in there. He reiterated that if Lee didn’t want the place someone else would (as if it hadn’t been standing vacant all year), then invited the brothers to inspect the bedrooms. I wondered how they would enjoy Rosette’s artistic efforts.</p><p class="calibre13">I lost their voices, then got them again as they toured the kitchen area. I was happy to see them pass the Leaning Lamp of Pisa without a glance.</p><p class="calibre13">“—basement?” Robert asked.</p><p class="calibre13">“No basement!” Snakeskin Boots replied, booming it, as if the lack of a basement were an advantage. Apparently he thought it was. “Neighborhood like this, all they do is ship water. And the damp, law!” Here I lost the vocal track again as he opened the rear door to show them the backyard. Which was not a yard at all but an empty field.</p><p class="calibre13">Five minutes later they were out front again. This time it was Robert, the elder brother, who tried to dicker. He had no more success than Lee had.</p><p class="calibre13">“Will you give us a minute?” Robert asked.</p><p class="calibre13">Snakeskin Boots looked at his clunky chromed-up watch, and allowed as how he could do that. “But I got a ’pointment over on Church Street, so you fellas need to hurry on n make up your minds.”</p><p class="calibre13">Robert and Lee walked to the rear of Robert’s Bel Air, and although they pitched their voices low to keep Snakeskin Boots from hearing, when I tilted the bowl in their direction, I got most of it. Robert was in favor of looking at some more places. Lee said he wanted this one. It would do fine for a start.</p><p class="calibre13">“Lee, it’s a hole,” Robert said. “It’s throwin your . . .” <span class="italic">Money away,</span> probably.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">Lee said something I couldn’t make out. Robert sighed and raised his hands in surrender. They went back to Snakeskin Boots, who gave Lee’s hand a brief pump and praised the wisdom of his choice. He launched into the Landlord Scripture: first month, last month, damage deposit. Robert stepped in then, saying there would be no damage deposit until the walls were fixed and the new mattress was installed.</p><p class="calibre13">“New mattress, sure,” Snakeskin Boots said. “And I’ll see that step fixed so the little woman don’t turn her ankle. But if’n I fix them walls right off, I’d have to boost the rent by five a month.”</p><p class="calibre13">I knew from Al’s notes that Lee was going to take the place, and still I expected him to walk away from this outrage. Instead, he took a limp wallet out of his back pocket and removed a thin sheaf of bills. He counted most of them into his new landlord’s outstretched hand while Robert walked back to his car, shaking his head in disgust. His eyes turned briefly to my house across the street, then passed on, disinterested.</p><p class="calibre13">Snakeskin Boots flogged Lee’s hand again, then jumped into his Chrysler and drove off fast, leaving a scrunch of dust behind.</p><p class="calibre13">One of the jump-rope girls came barreling up on a rusty scooter. “You movin into Rosette’s house, mister?” she asked Robert.</p><p class="calibre13">“No, he is,” Robert said, and cocked a thumb at his brother.</p><p class="calibre13">She pushed her scooter to Lee and asked the man who was going to blow off the right side of Jack Kennedy’s head if he had any kids.</p><p class="calibre13">“I’ve got a little girl,” Lee said. He put his hands on his knees so he could get down to her level.</p><p class="calibre13">“She purty?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Not as pretty as you, nor as big.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Can she jump rope?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Honey, she can’t even walk yet.” <span class="italic">Can’t</span> came out <span class="italic">cain’t.</span></p><p class="calibre13">“Well bullpucky on her.” She scooted away in the direction of Winscott Road.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">The two brothers turned toward the house. This muffled them a little, but when I cranked the volume, I could still make out most of what they were saying.</p><p class="calibre13">“This . . . pig in a poke,” Robert told him. “When Marina sees it, she’ll be on you like flies on a dog-turd.”</p><p class="calibre13">“I’ll . . . Rina,” Lee said. “But brother, if I don’t . . . from Ma and out of that little apartment, I’m apt to kill her.”</p><p class="calibre13">“She can be a . . . but . . . loves you, Lee.” Robert walked a few steps toward the street. Lee joined him, and their voices came through clear as a bell.</p><p class="calibre13">“I know it, but she can’t help herself. The other night when me n Rina’s goin at it, she hollers at us from the foldout. She’s sleeping in the livin room, you know. ‘Take it easy on that, you two,’ she hollers, ‘it’s too soon for another one. Wait until you can pay for the one you’ve got.’”</p><p class="calibre13">“I know it. She can be hard.”</p><p class="calibre13">“She keeps <span class="italic">buyin</span> things, brother. Says they’re for Rina, but shoves em up into <span class="italic">my</span> face.” Lee laughed and walked back to the Bel Air. This time it was his eyes that skated across 2706, and it took all I had to hold still behind the drapes. And to hold the bowl still, too.</p><p class="calibre13">Robert joined him. They leaned on the back bumper, two men in clean blue shirts and workingmen’s pants. Lee wore a tie, which he now pulled down.</p><p class="calibre13">“Listen to this. Ma goes to Leonard Brothers and comes back with all these clothes for Rina. She drags out a pair of shorts that are as long as bloomers, only paisley. ‘Look, Reenie, aren’t they purty?’ she says.” Lee’s imitation of his mother’s accent was savage.</p><p class="calibre13">“What’d Rina say?” Robert was smiling.</p><p class="calibre13">“She says, ‘No, Mamochka, no, I thank but I no like, I no like. I like <span class="italic">this</span> way.’ Then she puts her hand on her leg.” Lee put the side of his hand on his own, about halfway up the thigh.</p><p class="calibre13">Robert’s smile widened to a grin. “Bet Ma liked <span class="italic">that.</span>”</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">“She says, ‘Marina, shorts like that are for young girls who parade themselves on the streets looking for boyfriends, not for married women.’ You’re not to tell her where we are, brother. You are <span class="italic">not.</span> We got that straight?”</p><p class="calibre13">Robert didn’t say anything for a few seconds. Perhaps he was remembering a cold day in November of 1960. His mama trotting after him along West Seventh, calling out, “<span class="italic">Stop,</span> Robert, don’t walk so fast, I’m not done with you!” And although Al’s notes said nothing on the subject, I doubted if she was done with Lee, either. After all, Lee was the son she really cared about. The baby of the family. The one who slept in the same bed with her until he was eleven. The one who needed regular checking to see if he’d started getting hair around his balls yet. Those things <span class="italic">were</span> in Al’s notes. Next to them, in the margin, were two words you’d not ordinarily expect from a short-order cook: <span class="italic">hysterical fixation.</span></p><p class="calibre13">“We got it straight, Lee, but this ain’t a big town. She’ll find you.”</p><p class="calibre13">“I’ll send her packing if she does. You can count on that.”</p><p class="calibre13">They got into the Bel Air and drove away. The FOR RENT sign was gone from the porch railing. Lee and Marina’s new landlord had taken it with him when he went.</p><p class="calibre13">I walked to the hardware store, bought a roll of friction tape, and covered the Tupperware bowl with it, outside and inside. On the whole, I thought it had been a good day, but I had entered the danger zone. And I knew it.</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">4</span></span></p><p class="calibre21">On August 10, around five in the afternoon, the Bel Air reappeared, this time pulling a small wooden trailer. It took Lee and Robert less than ten minutes to carry all of the Oswalds’ worldly goods into the new manse (being careful to avoid the loose porch board, which had still not been fixed). During the moving-in process, Marina stood on the crabgrassy lawn with June in her arms, looking at her new home with an expression of dismay that needed no translation.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">This time all three of the jump-rope girls appeared, two walking, the other pushing her scooter. They demanded to see the baby, and Marina complied with a smile.</p><p class="calibre13">“What’s her name?” one of the girls asked.</p><p class="calibre13">“June,” Marina said.</p><p class="calibre13">Then they all jumped in. “How old is she? Can she talk? Why don’t she laugh? Does she have a dolly?”</p><p class="calibre13">Marina shook her head. She was still smiling. “Sorry, I no spik.”</p><p class="calibre13">The three girls pelted off, yelling <span class="italic">“I no spik, I no spik!”</span> One of the surviving Mercedes Street chickens flew out of their way, squawking. Marina watched them go, her smile fading.</p><p class="calibre13">Lee came out on the lawn to join her. He was stripped to the waist, sweating hard. His skin was fishbelly white. His arms were thin and slack. He put an arm around her waist, then bent and kissed June. I thought Marina might point at the house and say <span class="italic">no like, I no like</span>—she had that much English down—but she only handed Lee the baby and climbed to the porch, tottering for a moment on the loose step, then catching her balance. It occurred to me that Sadie probably would have gone sprawling, then limped on a swollen ankle for the next ten days.</p><p class="calibre13">It also occurred to me that Marina was as anxious to get away from Marguerite as her husband was.</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">5</span></span></p><p class="calibre21">The tenth was a Friday. On Monday, about two hours after Lee had left for another day of putting together aluminum screen doors, a mud-colored station wagon pulled up to the curb in front of 2703. Marguerite Oswald was out on the passenger side almost before it stopped rolling. Today the red kerchief had been replaced by a white one with black polka dots, but the nurse’s shoes were the same, and so was the look of dissatisfied pugnacity. She had found them, just as Robert had said she would.</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="italic">Hound of heaven,</span> I thought. <span class="italic">Hound of heaven.</span></p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">I was looking out through the crack between the drapes, but saw no point in powering up the mike. This was a story that needed no soundtrack.</p><p class="calibre13">The friend who had driven her—a portly gal—struggled out from behind the wheel and fanned the neck of her dress. The day was already another scorcher, but Marguerite cared nothing for that. She hustled her chauffeur around to the trunk of the station wagon. Inside was a high chair and a bag of groceries. Marguerite took the former; her friend hoisted the latter.</p><p class="calibre13">The jump-rope girl with the scooter came riding up, but Marguerite gave her short shrift. I heard “Scat, child!” and the jump-rope girl rode away with her lower lip pooched out.</p><p class="calibre13">Marguerite marched up the bald rut that served as a front walk. While she was eyeing the loose step, Marina came out. She was wearing a smock top and the kind of shorts Mrs. Oswald didn’t approve of for married women. I wasn’t surprised that Marina liked them. She had terrific legs. Her expression was one of startled alarm, and I didn’t need my makeshift amplifier to hear her.</p><p class="calibre13">“No, Mamochka—Mamochka, no! Lee say no! Lee say no! Lee say—” Then a quick rattle of Russian as Marina expressed what her husband had said in the only way she could.</p><p class="calibre13">Marguerite Oswald was one of those Americans who believe foreigners are sure to understand you if you just speak <span class="italic">slowly</span> . . . and <span class="italic">very LOUDLY.</span></p><p class="calibre13">“Yes . . . Lee . . . has . . . his . . . PRIDE!” she bugled. She climbed to the porch (deftly avoiding the bad step) and spoke directly into her daughter-in-law’s startled face. “Nothing . . . wrong . . . with that . . . but he can’t . . . let . . . my GRANDDAUGHTER . . . pay . . . the PRICE!”</p><p class="calibre13">She was beefy. Marina was willowy. “Mamochka” steamed inside without a second look. This was followed by a moment of silence, then a longshoreman’s bellow.</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="italic">“Where’s that little CUTIE of mine?”</span></p><p class="calibre13">Deep in the house, probably in Rosette’s old bedroom, June began to wail.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">The woman who had driven Marguerite gave Marina a tentative smile, then went inside with the bag of groceries.</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">6</span></span></p><p class="calibre21">Lee came walking down Mercedes Street from the bus stop at five-thirty, banging a black dinnerbucket against one thigh. He mounted the steps, forgetting the bad one. It shifted; he tottered, dropped his dinnerbucket, then bent to pick it up.</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="italic">That’ll improve his mood,</span> I thought.</p><p class="calibre13">He went in. I watched him cross the living room and put his dinnerbucket on the kitchen counter. He turned and saw the new high chair. He obviously knew his ma’s modus operandi, because next he opened the rusty refrigerator. He was still peering into it when Marina came out of the baby’s room. She had a diaper over her shoulder, and the binocs were good enough for me to see there was some spit-up on it.</p><p class="calibre13">She spoke to him, smiling, and he turned to her. He had the fair skin that’s every easy blusher’s bane, and his scowling face was bright red all the way to his thinning hair. He started shouting at her, pointing a finger at the refrigerator (the door still stood open, exhaling vapor). She turned to go back into the baby’s room. He caught her by the shoulder, spun her around, and began to shake her. Her head snapped back and forth.</p><p class="calibre13">I didn’t want to watch this, and there was no reason I should; it added nothing to what I needed to know. He was a beater, yes, but she was going to survive him, which was more than John F. Kennedy could say . . . or Officer Tippit, for that matter. So no, I didn’t need to see. But sometimes you can’t look away.</p><p class="calibre13">They argued it back and forth, Marina no doubt trying to explain that she didn’t <span class="italic">know</span> how Marguerite had found them and that she’d been unable to keep “Mamochka” out of the house. And of course Lee finally hit her in the face, because he couldn’t hit his ma. Even if she’d been there, he wouldn’t have been able to raise a fist against her.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">Marina cried out. He let her go. She spoke to him passionately, her hands held out. He tried to take one of them and she slapped it away. Then she raised those hands to the ceiling, dropped them, and walked out the front door. Lee started to follow her, then thought better of it. The brothers had put two ratty old lawn chairs on the porch. Marina sank into one of them. There was a scrape below her left eye, and her cheek was already starting to swell. She stared out into the street, and across it. I felt a stab of guilty fear even though my living room lights were out and I knew she couldn’t see me. I was careful to remain still, though, with the binoculars frozen to my face.</p><p class="calibre13">Lee sat down at the kitchen table and propped his forehead on the heels of his palms. He remained that way for awhile, then heard something and went into the smaller of the bedrooms. He came out with June in his arms and began to walk her around the living room, rubbing her back, soothing her. Marina went inside. June saw her and held out her chubby arms. Marina went to them and Lee gave her the baby. Then, before she could walk away, he hugged her. She stood silently inside his arms for a moment, then shifted the baby so she could hug him back with one arm. His mouth was buried in her hair, and I was pretty sure I knew what he was saying: the Russian words for <span class="italic">I’m sorry.</span> I had no doubt that he was. He would be sorry next time, too. And the time after that.</p><p class="calibre13">Marina took June back into what had been Rosette’s bedroom. Lee stood where he was for a moment, then went to the fridge, took something out, and began to eat it.</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">7</span></span></p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre21">Late the following day, just as Lee and Marina were sitting down to supper ( June lay on the living room floor, kicking her legs on a blanket), Marguerite came puffing down the street from the Winscott Road bus stop. This evening she was wearing blue slacks that were unfortunate, considering the generous spread of her butt. She was toting a large cloth bag. Poking out of the top was the red plastic roof of a child’s playhouse. She walked up the porch steps (once more deftly avoiding the bad one) and marched in without knocking.</p><p class="calibre13">I fought against the temptation to get my directional mike—this was another scene I did not need to be privy to—and lost. There’s nothing so fascinating as a family argument, I think Leo Tolstoy said that. Or maybe it was Jonathan Franzen. By the time I got it plugged in and aimed through my open window at the open window across the street, the rhubarb was in full swing.</p><p class="calibre13">“. . . wanted you to know where we were, I would have damn well <span class="italic">told</span> you!”</p><p class="calibre13">“Vada told me, she’s a good girl,” Marguerite said placidly. Lee’s rage washed over her like a light summer shower. She was unloading mismatched dishes onto the counter with the speed of a blackjack dealer. Marina was looking at her with outright amazement. The playhouse sat on the floor, next to June’s baby blanket. June kicked her legs and ignored it. Of course she ignored it. What’s a four-month-old going to do with a playhouse?</p><p class="calibre13">“Ma, you have to leave us alone! You have to stop <span class="italic">bringing</span> things! I can take care of my family!”</p><p class="calibre13">Marina added her two cents’ worth: “Mamochka, Lee say no.”</p><p class="calibre13">Marguerite laughed merrily. “‘Lee say no, Lee say no.’ Honey, Lee <span class="italic">always</span> say no, this little man been doin it all his life and it doesn’t mean a thing. Ma takes care of him.” She pinched his cheek, the way a mother would pinch the cheek of a six-year-old after he has done something naughty but undeniably cute. If Marina had tried that, I’m sure Lee would have knocked her block off.</p><p class="calibre13">At some point the jump-rope girls had drifted onto the bald excuse for a lawn. They watched the argument as attentively as Globe groundlings checking out the newest Shakespeare offering in the standing-room section. Only in the play we were watching, the shrew was going to come out on top.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">“What did she make you for dinner, honey? Was it something good?”</p><p class="calibre13">“We had stew. <span class="italic">Zharkoye.</span> That guy Gregory sent some coupons for the ShopRite.” His mouth worked. Marguerite waited. “Did you want some, Ma?”</p><p class="calibre13">“<span class="italic">Zharkoye</span> pretty okay, Mamochka,” Marina said with a hopeful smile.</p><p class="calibre13">“No, I couldn’t eat anything like that,” Marguerite said.</p><p class="calibre13">“Hell, Ma, you don’t even know what it is!”</p><p class="calibre13">It was as if he hadn’t spoken. “It would upset my stomach. Besides, I don’t want to be on a city bus after eight o’clock. There are too many drunk men on them after eight o’clock. Lee, honey, you need to fix that step before someone breaks a leg.”</p><p class="calibre13">He muttered something, but Marguerite’s attention had moved elsewhere. She swooped down like a hawk on a fieldmouse and grabbed June. With my binoculars, the baby’s startled expression was unmistakable.</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="italic">“How’s my little CUTIE tonight? How’s my DEAR ONE? How’s my little DEVUSHKA?”</span></p><p class="calibre13">Her little devushka, scared shitless, began to scream her head off.</p><p class="calibre13">Lee made a move to take the baby. Marguerite’s red lips peeled back from her teeth in what could have been a grin, but only if you wanted to be charitable. It looked more like a snarl to me. It must have to her son, too, because he stepped back. Marina was biting her lip, her eyes wide with dismay.</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="italic">“Oooo, Junie! Junie-Moonie-SPOONIE!”</span></p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">Marguerite marched back and forth across the threadbare green carpet, ignoring June’s increasingly distressed wails just as she had ignored Lee’s anger. Was she actually <span class="italic">feeding</span> on those wails? It looked that way to me. After awhile, Marina could bear it no longer. She got up and went to Marguerite, who steamed away from her, holding the baby to her breasts. Even from across the street I could imagine the sound of her big white nurse’s shoes: <span class="italic">clud-clump-clud</span>. Marina followed her. Marguerite, perhaps feeling her point was made, at last surrendered the baby. She pointed at Lee, then spoke to Marina in her loud English instructor’s voice.</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="italic">“He gained weight . . . when you were staying with me . . . because I fixed him . . . all the things he LIKES . . . but he’s still TOO . . . DAMN . . . SKINNY!”</span></p><p class="calibre13">Marina was looking at her over the top of the baby’s head, her pretty eyes wide. Marguerite rolled her own, either in impatience or outright disgust, and put her face down to Marina’s. The Leaning Lamp of Pisa was turned on, and the light skated across the lenses of Marguerite’s cat’s-eye glasses.</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="italic">“FIX HIM . . . WHAT HE’LL EAT! NO . . . SOURED . . . CREAM! NO . . . YOGRIT! HE’S . . . TOO . . . SKINNY!”</span></p><p class="calibre13">“Skeeny,” Marina said doubtfully. Safe in her mother’s arms, June’s weeping was winding down to watery hiccups.</p><p class="calibre13">“Yes!” Marguerite said. Then she whirled to Lee. “Fix that step!”</p><p class="calibre13">With that she left, only pausing to put a large smack on her granddaughter’s head. When she walked back toward the bus stop, she was smiling. She looked younger.</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">8</span></span></p><p class="calibre21">On the morning after Marguerite brought the playhouse, I was up at six. I went to the drawn drapes and peeked out through the crack without even thinking about it—spying on the house across the street had become a habit. Marina was sitting in one of the lawn chairs, smoking a cigarette. She was wearing pink rayon pajamas that were far too big for her. She had a new black eye, and there were spots of blood on the pajama shirt. She smoked slowly, inhaling deeply and staring out at nothing.</p><p class="calibre13">After awhile she went back inside and made breakfast. Pretty soon Lee came out and ate it. He didn’t look at her. He read a book.</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">9</span></span></p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre21"><span class="italic">That guy Gregory sent some coupons for the ShopRite,</span> Lee had told his mother, perhaps to explain the meat in the stew, maybe just to inform her that he and Marina weren’t alone and friendless in Fort Worth. That appeared to have passed unnoticed by Mamochka, but it didn’t pass unnoticed by me. Peter Gregory was the first link in the chain that would lead George de Mohrenschildt to Mercedes Street.</p><p class="calibre13">Like de Mohrenschildt, Gregory was a Russian expat in the petroleum biz. He was originally from Siberia, and taught Russian one night a week at the Fort Worth Library. Lee discovered this and called for an appointment to ask if he, Lee, could possibly get work as a translator. Gregory gave him a test and found his Russian “passable.” What Gregory was really interested in—what <span class="italic">all</span> the expats were interested in, Lee must have felt—was the former Marina Prusakova, a young girl from Minsk who had somehow managed to escape the clutches of the Russian bear only to wind up in those of an American boor.</p><p class="calibre13">Lee didn’t get the job; Gregory hired Marina instead—to give his son Paul Russian lessons. It was money the Oswalds desperately needed. It was also something else for Lee to resent. She was tutoring a rich kid twice a week while he was stuck putting together screen doors.</p><p class="calibre13">The morning I observed Marina smoking on the porch, Paul Gregory, good-looking and about Marina’s age, pulled up in a brand-new Buick. He knocked, and Marina—wearing heavy makeup that made me think of Bobbi Jill—opened the door. Either mindful of Lee’s possessiveness or because of rules of propriety she had learned back home, she gave him his lesson on the porch. It lasted an hour and a half. June lay between them on her blanket, and when she cried, the two of them took turns holding her. It was a nice little scene, although Mr. Oswald would probably not have thought so.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">Around noon, Paul’s father pulled up behind the Buick. There were two men and two women with him. They brought groceries. The elder Gregory hugged his son, then kissed Marina on the cheek (the one that wasn’t swollen). There was a lot of talk in Russian. The younger Gregory was lost, but Marina was found: she lit up like a neon sign. She invited them in. Soon they were sitting in the living room, drinking iced tea and talking. Marina’s hands flew like excited birds. June went from hand to hand and lap to lap.</p><p class="calibre13">I was fascinated. The Russian émigré community had found the girl-woman who would become their darling. How could she be anything else? She was young, she was a stranger in a strange land, she was beautiful. Of course, beauty happened to be married to the beast—a surly young American who hit her (bad), and who believed passionately in a system these upper-middle-class folks had just as passionately rejected (far worse).</p><p class="calibre13">Yet Lee would accept their groceries with only occasional outbursts of temper, and when they came with furnishings—a new bed, a bright pink crib for the baby—he accepted these, too. He hoped the Russians would get him out of the hole he was in. But he didn’t like them, and by the time he moved his family to Dallas in November of ’62, he must have known his feelings were heartily reciprocated. Why <span class="italic">would</span> they like him, he must have thought. He was ideologically pure. They were cowards who had abandoned Mother Russia when she was on her knees in ’43, who had licked the Germans’ jackboots and then fled to the United States when the war was over, quickly embracing the American Way . . . which to Oswald meant saber-rattling, minority-oppressing, worker-exploiting crypto-fascism.</p><p class="calibre13">Some of this I knew from Al’s notes. Most of it I saw played out on the stage across the street, or deduced from the only important conversation my lamp-bug picked up and recorded.</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">10</span></span></p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre21">On the evening of August twenty-fifth, a Saturday, Marina dolled up in a pretty blue dress and popped June into a corduroy romper with appliquéd flowers on the front. Lee, looking sour, emerged from the bedroom in what had to be his only suit. It was a moderately hilarious wool box that could only have been made in Russia. It was a hot night, and I imagined he would be wringing with sweat before it was over. They walked carefully down the porch steps (the bad one still hadn’t been fixed) and set off for the bus stop. I got into my car and drove up to the corner of Mercedes Street and Winscott Road. I could see them standing by the telephone pole with its white-painted stripe, arguing. Big surprise there. The bus came. The Oswalds got on. I followed, just as I had followed Frank Dunning in Derry.</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="italic">History repeats itself</span> is another way of saying the past harmonizes.</p><p class="calibre13">They got off the bus in a residential neighborhood on the north side of Dallas. I parked and watched them walk down to a small but handsome fieldstone-and-timber Tudor house. The carriage lamps at the end of the walk glowed softly in the dusk. There was no crabgrass on <span class="italic">this</span> lawn. Everything about the place shouted <span class="italic">America works!</span> Marina led the way to the house with the baby in her arms, Lee lagging slightly behind, looking lost in his double-breasted jacket, which swung almost to the backs of his knees.</p><p class="calibre13">Marina pushed Lee in front of her and pointed at the bell. He rang it. Peter Gregory and his son came out, and when June put her arms out to Paul, the young man laughed and took her. Lee’s mouth twitched downward when he saw this.</p><p class="calibre13">Another man came out. I recognized him from the group that had arrived on the day of Paul Gregory’s first language lesson, and he had been back to the Oswald place three or four times since, bringing groceries, toys for June, or both. I was pretty sure his name was George Bouhe (yes, another George, the past harmonizes in all sorts of ways), and although he was pushing sixty, I had an idea he was seriously crushing on Marina.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">According to the short-order cook who’d gotten me into this, Bouhe was the one who persuaded Peter Gregory to throw the get-acquainted party. George de Mohrenschildt wasn’t there, but he’d hear about it shortly thereafter. Bouhe would tell de Mohrenschildt about the Oswalds and their peculiar marriage. He would also tell de Mohrenschildt that Lee Oswald had made a scene at the party, praising socialism and the Russian collectives. <span class="italic">The young man strikes me as crazy,</span> Bouhe would say. De Mohrenschildt, a lifelong connoisseur of crazy, would decide he had to meet this odd couple for himself.</p><p class="calibre13">Why did Oswald blow his top at Peter Gregory’s party, offending the well-meaning expats who might otherwise have helped him? I didn’t know for sure, but I had a pretty good idea. There’s Marina, charming them all (especially the men) in her blue dress. There’s June, pretty as a Woolworth’s baby picture in her charity jumper with the sewn-on flowers. And there’s Lee, sweating in his ugly suit. He’s keeping up with the rapid ebb and flow of Russian better than young Paul Gregory, but in the end, he’s still left behind. It must have infuriated him to have to kowtow to these people, and to eat their salt. I hope it did. I hope it hurt.</p><p class="calibre13">I didn’t linger. What I cared about was de Mohrenschildt, the next link in the chain. He would arrive onstage soon. Meanwhile, all three Oswalds were finally out of 2703, and would be until at least ten o’clock. Given that the following day was Sunday, maybe even later.</p><p class="calibre13">I drove back to activate the bug in their living room.</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">11</span></span></p><p class="calibre21">Mercedes Street was partying hearty that Saturday night, but the field behind <span class="italic">chez</span> Oswald was silent and deserted. I thought my key would work on the back door as well as the front, but that was a theory I never had to test, because the back door was unlocked. During my time in Fort Worth, I never once used the key I’d purchased from Ivy Templeton. Life is full of ironies.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">The place was heartbreakingly neat. The high chair had been placed between the parents’ seats at the little table in the kitchen where they took their meals, the tray wiped gleaming-clean. The same was true of the peeling surface of the counter and the sink with its rusty hard-water ring. I made a bet with myself that Marina would have left Rosette’s jumper-clad girls and went into what was now June’s room to check. I had brought a penlight and shined it around the walls. Yes, they were still there, although in the dark they were more ghostly than cheerful. June probably looked at them as she lay in her crib, sucking her bokkie. I wondered if she would remember them later, on some deep level of her mind. Crayola ghost-girls.</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="italic">Jimla,</span> I thought for no reason at all, and shivered.</p><p class="calibre13">I moved the bureau, attached the tapwire to the lamp’s plug, and fed it through the hole I’d drilled in the wall. All fine, but then I had a bad moment. Very bad. When I moved the bureau back into place, it bumped against the wall and the Leaning Lamp of Pisa toppled.</p><p class="calibre13">If I’d had time to think, I would have frozen in place and the damn thing would have shattered on the floor. Then what? Remove the bug and leave the pieces? Hope they’d accept the idea that the lamp, unsteady to begin with, had fallen on its own? Most people would buy that, but most people don’t have reason to be paranoid about the FBI. Lee might find the hole I’d drilled in the wall. If he did, the butterfly would spread its wings.</p><p class="calibre13">But I didn’t have time to think. I reached out and caught the lamp on the way down. Then I just stood there, holding it and shaking. It was hot as an oven in the little house, and I could smell the stink of my own sweat. Would <span class="italic">they</span> smell it when they came back? How could they not?</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">I wondered if I were mad. Surely the smart thing would be to remove the bug . . . and then remove myself. I could reconnect with Oswald on April tenth of next year, watch him try to assassinate General Edwin Walker, and if he was on his own, I could then kill him just as I had Frank Dunning. KISS, as they say in Christy’s AA meetings; keep it simple, stupid. Why in God’s name was I fucking with a bugged thriftshop lamp when the future of the world was at stake?</p><p class="calibre13">It was Al Templeton who answered. <span class="italic">You’re here because the window of uncertainty is still open. You’re here because if George de Mohrenschildt is more than he appears, then maybe Oswald wasn’t the one. You’re here to save Kennedy, and making sure starts now. So put that fucking lamp back where it belongs.</span></p><p class="calibre13">I put the lamp back where it belonged, although its unsteadiness worried me. What if Lee knocked it off the bureau himself, and saw the bug inside when the ceramic base shattered? For that matter, what if Lee and de Mohrenschildt conversed in this room, but with the lamp off and in tones too low for my long-distance mike to pick up? Then it all would have been for nothing.</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="italic">You’ll never make an omelet thinking that way, buddy.</span></p><p class="calibre13">What convinced me was the thought of Sadie. I loved her and she loved me—at least she had—and I’d thrown that away to come here to this shitty street. And by Christ, I wasn’t going to leave without at least trying to hear what George de Mohrenschildt had to say for himself.</p><p class="calibre13">I slipped through the back door, and with the penlight clamped in my teeth, connected the tapwire to the tape recorder. I slid the recorder into a rusty Crisco can to protect it from the elements, then concealed it in the little nest of bricks and boards I had already prepared.</p><p class="calibre13">Then I went back to my own shitty little house on that shitty little street and began to wait.</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">12</span></span></p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre21">They never used the lamp until it got almost too dark to see. Saving on the electricity bill, I suppose. Besides, Lee was a workingman. He went to bed early, and she went when he did. The first time I checked the tape, what I had was mostly Russian—and draggy Russian at that, given the super-slow speed of the recorder. If Marina tried out her English vocabulary, Lee would reprimand her. Nevertheless, he sometimes spoke to June in English if the baby was fussy, always in low, soothing tones. Sometimes he even sang to her. The super-slow recordings made him sound like an orc trying its hand at “Rockabye, Baby.”</p><p class="calibre13">Twice I heard him hit Marina, and the second time, Russian wasn’t good enough to express his rage. “You worthless, nagging cunt! I guess maybe my ma was right about you!” This was followed by the slam of a door, and the sound of Marina crying. It cut out abruptly as she turned off the lamp.</p><p class="calibre13">On the evening of September fourth, I saw a kid, thirteen or so, come to the Oswalds’ door with a canvas sack over his shoulder. Lee, barefoot and dressed in a tee-shirt and jeans, opened up. They spoke. Lee invited him inside. They spoke some more. At one point Lee picked up a book and showed it to the kid, who looked at it dubiously. There was no chance of using the directional mike, because the weather had turned cool and the windows over there were shut. But the Leaning Lamp of Pisa was on, and when I retrieved the second tape late the following night, I was treated to an amusing conversation. By the third time I played it, I hardly heard the slow drag of the voices.</p><p class="calibre13">The kid was selling subscriptions to a newspaper—or maybe it was a magazine—called <span class="italic">Grit.</span> He informed the Oswalds that it had all sorts of interesting stuff the New York papers couldn’t be bothered with (he labeled this “country news”), plus sports and gardening tips. It also had what he called “fiction stories” and comic strips. “You won’t get <span class="italic">Dixie Dugan</span> in the <span class="italic">Times Herald,</span>” he informed them. “My mama loves Dixie.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Well son, that’s fine,” Lee said. “You’re quite the little businessman, aren’t you?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Uh . . . yessir?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Tell me how much you make.”</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">“I don’t get but four cents on every dime, but that ain’t the big thing, sir. Mostly what I like is the prizes. They’re way better than the ones you get selling Cloverine Salve. Nuts to that! I goan get me a .22! My dad said I could have it.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Son, do you know you’re being exploited?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Huh?”</p><p class="calibre13">“They take the dimes. You get pennies and the promise of a rifle.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Lee, he nice boy,” Marina said. “Be nice. Leave alone.”</p><p class="calibre13">Lee ignored her. “You need to know what’s in this book, son. Can you read what’s on the front?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Oh, yessir. It says <span class="italic">The Condition of the Working Class,</span> by Fried-rik . . . Ing-gulls?”</p><p class="calibre13">“<span class="italic">Engels</span>. It’s all about what happens to boys who think they’re going to wind up millionaires by selling stuff door-to-door.”</p><p class="calibre13">“I don’t want to be no millionaire,” the boy objected. “I just want a .22 so I can plink rats at the dump like my friend Hank.”</p><p class="calibre13">“You make pennies selling their newspapers; they make dollars selling your sweat, and the sweat of a million boys like you. The free market isn’t free. You need to educate yourself, son. I did, and I started when I was just your age.”</p><p class="calibre13">Lee gave the <span class="italic">Grit</span> newsboy a ten-minute lecture on the evils of capitalism, complete with choice quotes from Karl Marx. The boy listened patiently, then asked: “So you goan buy a sup-scription?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Son, have you listened to a single word I’ve said?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Yessir!”</p><p class="calibre13">“Then you should know that this system has stolen from me just as it’s stealing from you and your family.”</p><p class="calibre13">“You broke? Why didn’t you say so?”</p><p class="calibre13">“What I’ve been trying to do is explain to you <span class="italic">why</span> I’m broke.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Well, gol-lee! I could’ve tried three more houses, but now I have to go home because it’s almost my curfew!”</p><p class="calibre13">“Good luck,” Marina said.</p><p class="calibre13">The front door squalled open on its old hinges, then rattled shut (it was too tired to thump). There was a long silence. Then Lee said, in a flat voice: “You see. That’s what we’re up against.”</p><p class="calibre13">Not long after, the lamp went out.</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">13</span></span></p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre21">My new phone stayed mostly silent. Deke called once—one of those quick howya doin duty-calls—but that was all. I told myself I couldn’t expect more. School was back in, and the first few weeks were always harum-scarum. Deke was busy because Miz Ellie had unretired him. He told me that, after some grumbling, he had allowed her to put his name on the substitute list. Ellie wasn’t calling because she had five thousand things to do and probably five hundred little brushfires to put out.</p><p class="calibre13">I realized only after Deke hung up that he hadn’t mentioned Sadie . . . and two nights after Lee’s lecture to the newsboy, I decided I had to talk to her. I had to hear her voice, even if all she had to say was <span class="italic">Please don’t call me, George, it’s over.</span></p><p class="calibre13">As I reached for the phone, it rang. I picked it up and said—with complete certainty: “Hello, Sadie. Hello, honey.”</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">14</span></span></p><p class="calibre21">There was a moment of silence long enough for me to think I had been wrong after all, that someone was going to say <span class="italic">I’m not Sadie, I’m just some putz who dialed a wrong number.</span> Then she said: “How did you know it was me?”</p><p class="calibre13">I almost said <span class="italic">harmonics,</span> and she might have understood that. But <span class="italic">might</span> wasn’t good enough. This was an important call, and I didn’t want to screw it up. <span class="italic">Desperately</span> didn’t want to screw it up. Through most of what followed there were two of me on the phone, George who was speaking out loud and Jake on the inside, saying all the things George couldn’t. Maybe there are always two on each end of the conversation when good love hangs in the balance.</p><p class="calibre13">“Because I’ve been thinking about you all day,” I said. <span class="italic">(I’ve been thinking of you all summer.)</span></p><p class="calibre13">“How are you?”</p><p class="calibre13">“I’m fine.” <span class="italic">(I’m lonely.)</span> “How about you? How was your summer? Did you get it done?” <span class="italic">(Have you cut your legal ties to your weird husband?)</span></p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">“Yes,” she said. “Done deal. Isn’t that one of the things you say, George? Done deal?”</p><p class="calibre13">“I guess so. How’s school? How’s the library?”</p><p class="calibre13">“George? Are we going to talk like this, or are we going to talk?”</p><p class="calibre13">“All right.” I sat down on my lumpy secondhand couch. “Let’s talk. Are you okay?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Yes, but I’m unhappy. And I’m very confused.” She hesitated, then said: “I was working at Harrah’s, you probably know that. As a cocktail waitress. And I met somebody.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Oh?” <span class="italic">(Oh, shit.)</span></p><p class="calibre13">“Yes. A very nice man. Charming. A gentleman. Just shy of forty. His name is Roger Beaton. He’s an aide to the Republican senator from California, Tom Kuchel. He’s the minority whip in the Senate, you know. Kuchel, I mean, not Roger.” She laughed, but not the way you do when something’s funny.</p><p class="calibre13">“Should I be glad you met someone nice?”</p><p class="calibre13">“I don’t know, George . . . <span class="italic">are</span> you glad?”</p><p class="calibre13">“No.” <span class="italic">(I want to kill him.)</span></p><p class="calibre13">“Roger is handsome,” she said in a flat just-the-facts voice. “He’s pleasant. He went to Yale. He knows how to show a girl a good time. And he’s tall.”</p><p class="calibre13">The second me would no longer keep silent. “I want to kill him.”</p><p class="calibre13">That made her laugh, and the sound of it was a relief. “I’m not telling you this to hurt you, or make you feel bad.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Really? Then why <span class="italic">are</span> you telling me?”</p><p class="calibre13">“We went out three or four times. He kissed me . . . we made out a little . . . just necking, like kids. . . .”</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="italic">(I not only want to kill him, I want to do it slowly.)</span></p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">“But it wasn’t the same. Maybe it could be, in time; maybe not. He gave me his number in Washington, and told me to call him if I . . . how did he put it? ‘If you get tired of shelving books and carrying a torch for the one that got away.’ I think that was the gist of it. He says he’s going places, and that he needs a good woman to go with him. He thought I might be that woman. Of course, men say stuff like that. I’m not as naïve as I once was. But sometimes they mean it.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Sadie . . .”</p><p class="calibre13">“Still, it wasn’t quite the same.” She sounded thoughtful, absent, and for the first time I wondered if something other than doubt about her personal life might be wrong with her. If she might be sick. “On the plus side, there was no broom in evidence. Of course, sometimes men hide the broom, don’t they? Johnny did. You did, too, George.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Sadie?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Yes?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Are <span class="italic">you</span> hiding a broom?”</p><p class="calibre13">There was a long moment of silence. Much longer than the one when I had answered the phone with her name, and much longer than I expected. At last she said, “I don’t know what you mean.”</p><p class="calibre13">“You don’t sound like yourself, that’s all.”</p><p class="calibre13">“I told you, I’m very confused. And I’m sad. Because you’re still not ready to tell me the truth, are you?”</p><p class="calibre13">“If I could, I would.”</p><p class="calibre13">“You know something interesting? You have good friends in Jodie—not just me—and none of them know where you live.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Sadie—”</p><p class="calibre13">“You say it’s Dallas, but you’re on the Elmhurst exchange, and Elmhurst is Fort Worth.”</p><p class="calibre13">I’d never thought of that. What else hadn’t I thought of?</p><p class="calibre13">“Sadie, all I can tell you is that what I’m doing is very impor—”</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">“Oh, I’m sure it is. And what Senator Kuchel’s doing is very important, too. Roger was at pains to tell me that, and to tell me that if I . . . I joined him in Washington, I would be more or less sitting at the feet of greatnesss . . . or in the doorway to history . . . or something like that. Power excites him. It was one of the few things it was hard to like about him. What I thought—what I still think—is, who am I to sit at the feet of greatness? I’m just a divorced librarian.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Who am I to stand in the doorway to history?” I said.</p><p class="calibre13">“What? What did you say, George?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Nothing, hon.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Maybe you better not call me that.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Sorry.” <span class="italic">(I’m not.)</span> “What exactly are we talking about?”</p><p class="calibre13">“You and me and whether or not that still makes an <span class="italic">us.</span> It would help if you could tell me why you’re in Texas. Because I <span class="italic">know</span> you didn’t come to write a book or teach school.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Telling you could be dangerous.”</p><p class="calibre13">“We’re <span class="italic">all</span> in danger,” she said. “Johnny’s right about that. Will I tell you something Roger told me?”</p><p class="calibre13">“All right.” <span class="italic">(Where did he tell you, Sadie? And were the two of you vertical or horizontal when the conversation took place?)</span></p><p class="calibre13">“He’d had a drink or two, and he got gossipy. We were in his hotel room, but don’t worry—I kept my feet on the floor and all my clothes on.”</p><p class="calibre13">“I wasn’t worrying.”</p><p class="calibre13">“If you weren’t, I’m disappointed in you.”</p><p class="calibre13">“All right, I was worried. What did he say?”</p><p class="calibre13">“He said there’s a rumor that there’s going to be some sort of major deal in the Caribbean this fall or winter. A flashpoint, he called it. I’m assuming he meant Cuba. He said, ‘That idiot JFK is going to put us all in the soup just to show he’s got balls.’”</p><p class="calibre13">I remembered all the end-of-the-world crap her former husband had poured into her ears. <span class="italic">Anyone who reads the paper can see it coming,</span> he’d told her. <span class="italic">We’ll die with sores all over our bodies, and coughing up our lungs.</span> Stuff like that leaves an impression, especially when spoken in tones of dry scientific certainty. Leaves an impression? A scar, more like it.</p><p class="calibre13">“Sadie, that’s crap.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Oh?” She sounded nettled. “I suppose you have the inside scoop and Senator Kuchel doesn’t?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Let’s say I do.”</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">“Let’s not. I’ll wait for you to come clean a little longer, but not much. Maybe just because you’re a good dancer.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Then let’s go dancing!” I said a little wildly.</p><p class="calibre13">“Goodnight, George.”</p><p class="calibre13">And before I could say anything else, she hung up.</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">15</span></span></p><p class="calibre21">I started to call her back, but when the operator said “Number, please?” sanity reasserted itself. I put the phone back in its cradle. She had said what she needed to say. Trying to get her to say more would only make things worse.</p><p class="calibre13">I tried to tell myself that her call had been nothing but a stratagem to get me off the dime, a <span class="italic">speak for yourself, John Alden</span> kind of thing. It wouldn’t work because that wasn’t Sadie. It had seemed more like a cry for help.</p><p class="calibre13">I picked up the phone again, and this time when the operator asked for a number, I gave her one. The phone rang twice on the other end, and then Ellen Dockerty said, “Yes? Who is it, please?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Hi, Miz Ellie. It’s me. George.”</p><p class="calibre13">Maybe that moment-of-silence thing was catching. I waited. Then she said, “Hello, George. I’ve been neglecting you, haven’t I? It’s just that I’ve been awfully—”</p><p class="calibre13">“Busy, sure. I know what the first week or two’s like, Ellie. I called because Sadie just called me.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Oh?” She sounded very cautious.</p><p class="calibre13">“If you told her my number was on a Fort Worth exchange instead of Dallas, it’s okay.”</p><p class="calibre13">“I wasn’t gossiping. I hope you understand that. I thought she had a right to know. I care for Sadie. Of course I care for you, too, George . . . but you’re gone. She’s not.”</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">I <span class="italic">did</span> understand, although it hurt. The feeling of being in a space capsule bound for the outer depths recurred. “I’m fine with that, Ellie, and it really wasn’t much of a fib. I expect to be moving to Dallas soon.”</p><p class="calibre13">No response, and what could she say? <span class="italic">Perhaps you are, but we both know you’re a bit of a liar?</span></p><p class="calibre13">“I didn’t like the way she sounded. Does she seem all right to you?”</p><p class="calibre13">“I’m not sure I want to answer that question. If I said no, you might come roaring down to see her, and she doesn’t want to see you. Not as things stand.”</p><p class="calibre13">Actually she <span class="italic">had</span> answered my question. “Was she okay when she came back?”</p><p class="calibre13">“She was fine. Glad to see us all.”</p><p class="calibre13">“But now she sounds distracted and says she feels sad.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Is that so surprising?” Miz Ellie spoke with asperity. “There are lots of memories here for Sadie, many of them connected to a man she still has feelings for. A nice man and a lovely teacher, but one who arrived flying false colors.”</p><p class="calibre13">That one <span class="italic">really</span> hurt.</p><p class="calibre13">“It seemed like something else. She spoke about some sort of coming crisis that she heard about from—” From the Yalie who was sitting in the doorway of history? “From someone she met in Nevada. Her husband filled her head with a lot of nonsense—”</p><p class="calibre13">“Her head? Her pretty little head?” Not just asperity now; outright anger. It made me feel small and mean. “George, I have a stack of folders a mile high in front of me, and I need to get to them. You cannot psychoanalyze Sadie Dunhill at long distance, and I cannot help you with your love life. The only thing I can do is to advise you to come clean if you care for her. Sooner rather than later.”</p><p class="calibre13">“You haven’t seen her husband around, I suppose?”</p><p class="calibre13">“<span class="italic">No!</span> Goodnight, George!”</p><p class="calibre13">For the second time that night, a woman I cared about hung up on me. That was a new personal record.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">I went into the bedroom and began to undress. <span class="italic">Fine</span> when she arrived. <span class="italic">Glad</span> to be back with all her Jodie friends. Not so fine now. Because she was torn between the handsome, on-the-fast-track-to-success new guy and the tall dark stranger with the invisible past? That would probably be the case in a romance novel, but if it was the case here, why hadn’t she been down at the mouth when she came back?</p><p class="calibre13">An unpleasant thought occurred to me: maybe she was drinking. A lot. Secretly. Wasn’t it possible? My wife had been a secret heavy drinker for years—before I married her, in fact—and the past harmonizes with itself. It would be easy to dismiss that, to say that Miz Ellie would have spotted the signs, but drunks can be clever. Sometimes it’s years before people start to get wise. If Sadie was showing up for work on time, Ellie might not notice that she was doing so with bloodshot eyes and mints on her breath.</p><p class="calibre13">The idea was probably ridiculous. All my suppositions were suspect, each one colored by how much I still cared for Sadie.</p><p class="calibre13">I lay back on my bed, looking up at the ceiling. In the living room, the oil stove gurgled—it was another cool night.</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="italic">Let it go, buddy,</span> Al said. <span class="italic">You have to. Remember, you’re not here to get—</span></p><p class="calibre13">The girl, the gold watch, and everything. Yeah, Al, got it.</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="italic">Besides, she’s probably fine. You’re the one with the problem.</span></p><p class="calibre13">More than just one, actually, and it was a long time before I fell asleep.</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">16</span></span></p><p class="calibre21">The following Monday, when I made one of my regular drive-bys of 214 West Neely Street in Dallas, I observed a long gray funeral hack parked in the driveway. The two fat ladies were standing on the porch, watching a couple of men in dark suits lift a stretcher into the rear. On it was a sheeted form. On the tottery-looking balcony above the porch, the young couple from the upstairs apartment was also watching. Their youngest child was sleeping in his mother’s arms.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">The wheelchair with the ashtray clamped to the arm stood orphaned under the tree where the old man had spent most of his days last summer.</p><p class="calibre13">I pulled over and stood by my car until the hearse left. Then (although I realized the timing was rather, shall we say, crass) I crossed the street and walked up the path to the porch. At the foot of the stairs, I tipped my hat. “Ladies, I’m very sorry for your loss.”</p><p class="calibre13">The older of the two—the wife who was now a widow, I assumed—said: “You’ve been here before.”</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="italic">Indeed I have,</span> I thought of saying. <span class="italic">This thing is bigger than pro football.</span></p><p class="calibre13">“He saw you.” Not accusing; just stating a fact.</p><p class="calibre13">“I’ve been looking for an apartment in this neighborhood. Will you be keeping this one?”</p><p class="calibre13">“No,” the younger one said. “He had some <span class="italic">in</span>-surance. Bout the only thing he did have. ’Cept for some medals in a box.” She sniffed. I tell you, it broke my heart a little to see how grief-stricken those two ladies were.</p><p class="calibre13">“He said you was a ghost,” the widow told me. “He said he could see right through you. Accourse he was as crazy as a shithouse mouse. Last three years, ever since he had his stroke and they put him on that peebag. Me n Ida’s goin back to Oklahoma.”</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="italic">Try Mozelle,</span> I thought. <span class="italic">That’s where you’re supposed to go when you give up your apartment.</span></p><p class="calibre13">“What do you want?” the younger one asked. “We got to take him a suit on down to the funeary home.”</p><p class="calibre13">“I’d like the number of your landlord,” I said.</p><p class="calibre13">The widow’s eyes gleamed. “What’d it be worth to you, mister?”</p><p class="calibre13">“I’ll give it to you for free!” said the young woman on the second-floor balcony.</p><p class="calibre13">The bereaved daughter looked up and told her to shut her fucking mouth. That was the thing about Dallas. Derry, too.</p><p class="calibre13">Neighborly.</p><div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_33"></div></body>
