<a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">CHAPTER 17</span></span></p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">1</span></span></p><p class="calibre21">A few days before the end-of-year testing cycle began, Ellen Dockerty summoned me to her office. After she closed the door, she said: “I’m sorry for the trouble I’ve caused, George, but if I had it to do over again, I’m not sure I would behave any differently.”</p><p class="calibre13">I said nothing. I was no longer angry, but I was still stunned. I’d gotten very little sleep since the blow-up, and I had an idea that 4:00 <span class="calibre22">A.M.</span> and I were going to be close friends in the near future.</p><p class="calibre13">“Clause Twenty-five of the Texas School Administrative Code,” she said, as if that explained everything.</p><p class="calibre13">“I beg your pardon, Ellie?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Nina Wallingford was the one who brought it to my attention.” Nina was the district nurse. She put tens of thousands of miles on her Ford Ranch Wagon each school year circling Denholm County’s eight schools, three of them still of the one-or two-room variety. “Clause Twenty-five concerns the state’s rules for immunization in schools. It covers teachers as well as students, and Nina pointed out she didn’t have any immunization records for you. No medical records of any kind, in fact.”</p><p class="calibre13">And there it was. The fake teacher exposed by his lack of a polio shot. Well, at least it wasn’t my advanced knowledge of the Rolling Stones, or inappropriate use of disco slang.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">“You being so busy with the <span class="italic">Jamboree</span> and all, I thought I’d write to the schools where you’d taught and save you the trouble. What I got back from Florida was a letter stating that they don’t require immunization records from substitutes. What I got from Maine and Wisconsin was ‘Never heard of him.’”</p><p class="calibre13">She leaned forward behind her desk, looking at me. I couldn’t meet her gaze for long. What I saw in her face before I redirected my gaze to the backs of my hands was an unbearable sympathy.</p><p class="calibre13">“Would the State Board of Education care that we had hired an imposter? Very much. They might even institute legal action to recoup your year’s salary. Do I care? Absolutely not. Your work at DCHS has been exemplary. What you and Sadie did for Bobbi Jill Allnut was absolutely wonderful, the kind of thing that garners State Teacher of the Year nominations.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Thanks,” I muttered. “I guess.”</p><p class="calibre13">“I asked myself what Mimi Corcoran would do. What Meems said to me was, ‘If he had signed a contract to teach next year and the year after, you’d be forced to act. But since he’s leaving in a month, it’s actually in your interest—and the school’s—to say nothing.’ Then she added, ‘But there’s one person who <span class="italic">has</span> to know he’s not who he says he is.’”</p><p class="calibre13">Ellie paused.</p><p class="calibre13">“I told Sadie that I was sure you’d have some reasonable explanation, but it seems you do not.”</p><p class="calibre13">I glanced at my watch. “If you’re not firing me, Miz Ellie, I ought to get back to my period five class. We’re diagramming sentences. I’m thinking of trying them on a compound that goes, <span class="italic">I am blameless in this matter, but I cannot say why.</span> What do you think? Too tough?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Too tough for me, certainly,” she said pleasantly.</p><p class="calibre13">“One thing,” I said. “Sadie’s marriage was difficult. Her husband was strange in ways I don’t want to go into. His name is John Clayton. I think he might be dangerous. You need to ask Sadie if she has a picture of him, so you’ll know what he looks like if he shows up and starts asking questions.”</p><p class="calibre13">“And you think this because?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Because I’ve seen something like it before. Will that do?”</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">“I suppose it will have to, won’t it?”</p><p class="calibre13">That wasn’t a good enough answer. “Will you ask her?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Yes, George.” She might mean it; she might only be humoring me. I couldn’t tell.</p><p class="calibre13">I was at the door when she said, as if only passing the time of day: “You’re breaking that young woman’s heart.”</p><p class="calibre13">“I know,” I said, and left.</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">2</span></span></p><p class="calibre21">Mercedes Street. Late May.</p><p class="calibre13">“Welder, are you?”</p><p class="calibre13">I was standing on the porch of 2706 with the landlord, a fine American named Mr. Jay Baker. He was stocky, with a huge gut he called the house that Shiner built. We had just finished a quick tour of the premises, which Baker had explained to me was “Prime to the bus stop,” as if that made up for the sagging ceilings, water-stained walls, cracked toilet tank, and general air of decrepitude.</p><p class="calibre13">“Night watchman,” I said.</p><p class="calibre13">“Yeah? That’s a good job. Plenty of time to fuck the dog on a job like that.”</p><p class="calibre13">This seemed to require no response.</p><p class="calibre13">“No wife or kiddies?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Divorced. They’re back East.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Pay hellimony, do you?”</p><p class="calibre13">I shrugged.</p><p class="calibre13">He let it go. “So do you want the place, Amberson?”</p><p class="calibre13">“I guess so,” I said, and sighed.</p><p class="calibre13">He took a long rent-book with a floppy leather cover out of his back pocket. “First month, last month, damage deposit.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Damage deposit? You have to be kidding.”</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">Baker went on as if he hadn’t heard me. “Rent’s due on the last Friday of the month. Come up short or late and you’re on the street, courtesy of Fort Worth PD. Me’n them get along real good.”</p><p class="calibre13">He took the charred cigar stub from his breast pocket, stuck the chewed end in his gob, and popped a wooden match alight with his thumbnail. It was hot on the porch. I had an idea it was going to be a long, hot summer.</p><p class="calibre13">I sighed again. Then—with a show of reluctance—I took out my wallet and began to remove twenty-dollar bills. “In God we trust,” I said. “All others pay cash.”</p><p class="calibre13">He laughed, puffing out clouds of acrid blue smoke as he did so. “That’s good, I’ll remember that. Especially on the last Friday of the month.”</p><p class="calibre13">I couldn’t believe I was going to live in this desperate shack and on this desperate street, after my nice house south of here—where I’d taken pride in keeping an actual lawn mowed. Although I hadn’t even left Jodie yet, I felt a wave of homesickness.</p><p class="calibre13">“Give me a receipt, please,” I said.</p><p class="calibre13">That much I got for free.</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">3</span></span></p><p class="calibre21">It was the last day of school. The classrooms and hallways were empty. The overhead fans paddled air that was already hot, although it was only the eighth of June. The Oswald family had left Russia; in another five days, according to Al Templeton’s notes, the SS <span class="italic">Maasdam</span> would dock in Hoboken, where they would walk down the gangplank and onto United States soil.</p><p class="calibre13">The teachers’ room was empty except for Danny Laverty. “Hey, champ. Understand you’re going off to Dallas to finish that book of yours.”</p><p class="calibre13">“That’s the plan.” Fort Worth was actually the plan, at least to begin with. I began cleaning out my pigeonhole, which was stuffed with end-of-school communiqués.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">“If I was footloose and fancy-free instead of tied down to a wife, three rugrats, and a mortgage, I might try a book myself,” Danny said. “I was in the war, you know.”</p><p class="calibre13">I knew. Everyone knew, usually within ten minutes of meeting him.</p><p class="calibre13">“Got enough to live on?”</p><p class="calibre13">“I’ll be okay.”</p><p class="calibre13">I had more than enough to take me through to next April, when I expected to conclude my business with Lee Oswald. I wouldn’t need to make any more expeditions to Faith Financial on Greenville Avenue. Going there even once had been incredibly stupid. If I wanted, I could try to tell myself that what had happened to my place in Florida had just been the result of a prank gone bad, but I’d also tried to tell myself that Sadie and I were doing fine, and look how <span class="italic">that</span> had turned out.</p><p class="calibre13">I tossed the wad of paperwork from my pigeonhole into the trash . . . and saw a small sealed envelope I had somehow missed. I knew who used envelopes like that<span class="italic">.</span> There was no salutation on the sheet of notepaper inside, and no signature except for the faint (perhaps even illusory) scent of her perfume. The message was brief.</p><blockquote class="calibre24"><span class="italic">Thank you for showing me how good things can be. Please don’t say goodbye.</span></blockquote><p class="calibre13">I held it for a minute, thinking, then stuck it in my back pocket and walked rapidly down to the library. I don’t know what I planned to do or what I meant to tell her, but none of it mattered because the library was dark and the chairs were up on the tables. I tried the knob anyway, but the door was locked.</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">4</span></span></p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre21">The only two cars left at the faculty end of the parking lot were Danny Laverty’s Plymouth sedan and my Ford, the ragtop now looking rather raggedy. I could sympathize; I felt a bit raggedy myself.</p><p class="calibre13">“Mr. A! Wait up, Mr. A!”</p><p class="calibre13">It was Mike and Bobbi Jill, hurrying across the hot parking lot toward me. Mike was carrying a small wrapped present, which he held out to me. “Bobbi n me got you something.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Bobbi and <span class="italic">I.</span> And you shouldn’t have, Mike.”</p><p class="calibre13">“We had to, man.”</p><p class="calibre13">I was moved to see that Bobbi Jill was crying, and pleased to see that the thick coating of Max Factor had disappeared from her face. Now that she knew the disfiguring scar’s days were numbered, she had stopped trying to conceal it. She kissed me on the cheek.</p><p class="calibre13">“Thank you so, so, <span class="italic">so</span> much, Mr. Amberson. I’ll never forget you.” She looked at Mike. “<span class="italic">We’ll</span> never forget you.”</p><p class="calibre13">And they probably wouldn’t. That was a good thing. It didn’t make up for the locked and dark library, but yes—it was a very good thing.</p><p class="calibre13">“Open it,” Mike said. “We hope you like it. It’s for your book.”</p><p class="calibre13">I opened the package. Inside was a wooden box about eight inches long and two inches wide. Inside the box, cradled in silk, was a Waterman fountain pen with the initials GA engraved on the clip.</p><p class="calibre13">“Oh, Mike,” I said. “This is too much.”</p><p class="calibre13">“It wouldn’t be enough if it was solid gold,” he said. “You changed my life.” He looked at Bobbi. “Both our lives.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Mike,” I said, “it was my pleasure.”</p><p class="calibre13">He hugged me, and in 1962, that is not a cheap gesture between men. I was glad to hug him back.</p><p class="calibre13">“You stay in touch,” Bobbi Jill said. “Dallas ain’t far.” She paused. <span class="italic">“Isn’t.”</span></p><p class="calibre13">“I will,” I said, but I wouldn’t, and they probably wouldn’t, either. They were going off into their lives, and if they were lucky, their lives would shine.</p><p class="calibre13">They started away, then Bobbi turned back. “It’s a shame you two broke up. It makes me feel real bad.”</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">“It makes me feel bad, too,” I said, “but it’s probably for the best.”</p><p class="calibre13">I headed home to pack up my typewriter and my other belongings, which I reckoned were still few enough to fit into no more than a suitcase and a few cardboard boxes. At the one stoplight on Main Street, I opened the little box and looked at the pen. It was a beautiful thing, and I was very touched that they had given it to me. I was even more touched that they had waited to say goodbye. The light turned green. I snapped the lid of the box closed and drove on. There was a lump in my throat, but my eyes were dry.</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">5</span></span></p><p class="calibre21">Living on Mercedes Street was not an uplifting experience.</p><p class="calibre13">Days weren’t so bad. They resounded with the shouts of children recently released from school, all dressed in too-big hand-me-downs; housewives kvetching at mailboxes or backyard clotheslines; teenagers driving rusty beaters with glasspack mufflers and radios blaring K-Life. The hours between 2:00 and 6:00 <span class="calibre22">A.M.</span> weren’t so bad, either. Then a kind of stunned silence fell over the street as colicky babies finally slept in their cribs (or dresser drawers) and their daddies snored toward another day of hourly wages in the shops, factories, or outlying farms.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">Between four and six in the afternoon, however, the street was a jangle of mommas screaming at kids to get the hell in and do their chores and poppas arriving home to scream at their wives, probably because they had no one else to scream at. Many of the wives gave back as good as they got. The drunkadaddies started to roll in around eight, and things really got noisy around eleven, when either the bars closed or the money ran out. Then I heard slamming doors, breaking glass, and screams of pain as some loaded drunkadaddy tuned up on the wife, the kiddies, or both. Often red lights would strobe in through my drawn curtains as the cops arrived. A couple of times there were gunshots, maybe fired at the sky, maybe not. And one early morning, when I went out to get the paper, I saw a woman with dried blood crusting the lower half of her face. She was sitting on the curb in front of a house four down from mine, drinking a can of Lone Star. I almost went down to check on her, even though I knew how unwise it would be to get involved with the life of this low-bottom working neighborhood. Then she saw me looking at her and hoisted her middle finger. I went back inside.</p><p class="calibre13">There was no Welcome Wagon, and no women named Muffy or Buffy trotting off to Junior League meetings. What there was on Mercedes Street was plenty of time to think. Time to miss my friends in Jodie. Time to miss the work that had kept my mind off what I had come here to do. Time to realize the teaching had done a lot more than pass the time; it had satisfied my mind the way work does when you care about it, when you feel like you might actually be making a difference.</p><p class="calibre13">There was even time to feel bad about my formerly spiffy convertible. Besides the nonfunctional radio and the wheezy valves, it now blatted and backfired through a rusty tailpipe and there was a crack in the windshield caused by a rock that had bounced off the back of a lumbering asphalt truck. I’d stopped washing it, and now—sad to say—it fit in perfectly with the other busted-up transpo on Mercedes Street.</p><p class="calibre13">Mostly there was time to think about Sadie.</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="italic">You’re breaking that young woman’s heart,</span> Ellie Dockerty had said, and mine wasn’t doing so well, either. The idea of spilling everything to Sadie came to me one night as I lay awake listening to a drunken argument next door: <span class="italic">you did, I didn’t, you did, I didn’t, fuck you.</span> I rejected the idea, but it came back the following night, rejuvenated. I could see myself sitting with her at her kitchen table, drinking coffee in the strong afternoon sunlight that slanted through the window over the sink. Speaking calmly. Telling her my real name was Jacob Epping, I wouldn’t actually be born for another fourteen years, I had come from the year 2011 via a fissure in time that my late friend Al Templeton called the rabbit-hole.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">How would I convince her of such a thing? By telling her that a certain American defector who had changed his mind about Russia was shortly going to move in across the street from where I now lived, along with his Russian wife and their baby girl? By telling her that the Dallas Texans—not yet the Cowboys, not yet America’s Team—were going to beat the Houston Oilers 20–17 this fall, in double overtime? Ridiculous. But what else did I know about the immediate future? Not much, because I’d had no time to study up. I knew a fair amount about Oswald, but that was all.</p><p class="calibre13">She’d think I was crazy. I could sing her lyrics from another dozen pop songs that hadn’t been recorded yet, and she’d still think I was crazy. She’d accuse me of making them up myself—wasn’t I a writer, after all? And suppose she <span class="italic">did</span> believe it? Did I want to drag her into the shark’s mouth with me? Wasn’t it bad enough that she’d be coming back to Jodie in August, and that if John Clayton was an echo of Frank Dunning, he might come looking for her?</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="italic">“All right, get out then!”</span> a woman screamed from the street, and a car accelerated away in the direction of Winscott Road. A wedge of light probed briefly through a crack in my drawn curtains and flashed across the ceiling.</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="italic">“COCKSUCKER!”</span> she yelled after it, to which a male voice, a little more distant, yelled back: “You can suck mine, lady, maybe it’ll calm you down.”</p><p class="calibre13">That was life on Mercedes Street in the summer of ’62.</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="italic">Leave her out of it.</span> That was the voice of reason. <span class="italic">It’s just too dangerous. Maybe at some point she can be a part of your life again—a life in Jodie, even—but not now.</span></p><p class="calibre13">Only there was never going to be a life for me in Jodie. Given what Ellen now knew about my past, teaching at the high school was a fool’s dream. And what else was I going to do? Pour concrete?</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">One morning I put on the coffeepot and went for the paper on the stoop. When I opened the front door, I saw that both of the Sunliner’s rear tires were flat. Some bored out-too-late kid had slashed them with a knife. That was also life on Mercedes Street in the summer of ’62.</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">6</span></span></p><p class="calibre21">On Thursday, the fourteenth of June, I dressed in jeans, a blue workshirt, and an old leather vest I’d picked up at a secondhand store on Camp Bowie Road. Then I spent the morning pacing through my house. I had no television, but I listened to the radio. According to the news, President Kennedy was planning a state trip to Mexico later in the month. The weather report called for fair skies and warm temperatures. The DJ yammered awhile, then played “Palisades Park.” The screams and roller-coaster sound effects on the record clawed at my head.</p><p class="calibre13">At last I could stand it no longer. I was going to be early, but I didn’t care. I got into the Sunliner—which now sported two retread blackwalls to go with the whitewalls on the front—and drove the forty-odd miles to Love Field in northwest Dallas. There was no short-term or long-term parking, just parking. It cost seventy-five cents a day. I clapped my old summer straw on my head and trudged approximately half a mile to the terminal building. A couple of Dallas cops stood at the curb drinking coffee, but there were no security guards inside and no metal detectors to walk through. Passengers simply showed their tickets to a guy standing by the door, then walked across the hot tarmac to planes belonging to one of five carriers: American, Delta, TWA, Frontier, and Texas Airways.</p><p class="calibre13">I checked the chalkboard mounted on the wall behind the Delta counter. It said that Flight 194 was on time. When I asked the clerk to make sure, she smiled and told me it had just left Atlanta. “But you’re awfully early.”</p><p class="calibre13">“I can’t help it,” I said. “I’ll probably be early to my own funeral.”</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">She laughed and wished me a nice day. I bought a <span class="italic">Time</span> and walked across to the restaurant, where I ordered the Cloud 9 Chef’s Salad. It was huge and I was too nervous to be hungry—it’s not every day that a man gets to see the person who’s going to change world history—but it gave me something to pick at while I waited for the plane carrying the Oswald family to arrive.</p><p class="calibre13">I was in a booth with a good view of the main terminal. It wasn’t very crowded, and a young woman in a dark blue traveling suit caught my eye. Her hair was twisted into a neat bun. She had a suitcase in each hand. A Negro porter approached her. She shook her head, smiling, then banged her arm on the side of the Traveler’s Aid booth as she passed it. She dropped one of her suitcases, rubbed her elbow, then picked up the case again and forged onward.</p><p class="calibre13">Sadie leaving to start her six-week residency in Reno.</p><p class="calibre13">Was I surprised? Not at all. It was that convergence thing again. I’d grown used to it. Was I almost overwhelmed by an impulse to run out of the restaurant and catch up to her before it was too late? Of course I was.</p><p class="calibre13">For a moment it seemed more than possible, it seemed necessary. I would tell her fate (rather than some weird time-travel harmonic) had brought us together at the airport. Stuff like that worked in the movies, didn’t it? I’d ask her to wait while I bought my own ticket to Reno, and tell her that once we were there, I’d explain everything. And after the obligatory six weeks, we could buy a drink for the judge who had granted her divorce before he married us.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">I actually started to get up. As I did, I happened to look at the cover of the <span class="italic">Time</span> I’d bought at the newsstand. Jacqueline Kennedy was on the cover. She was smiling, radiant, wearing a sleeveless dress with a V-neck. THE PRESIDENT’S LADY DRESSES FOR SUMMER, the caption read. As I looked at the photo, the color drained away to black and white and the expression changed from a happy smile to a vacant stare. Now she was standing next to Lyndon Johnson on <span class="italic">Air Force One,</span> and no longer wearing the pretty (and slightly sexy) summer dress. A blood-spattered wool suit had taken its place. I remembered reading—not in Al’s notes, somewhere else—that not long after Mrs. Kennedy’s husband had been pronounced dead, Lady Bird Johnson had moved to embrace her in the hospital corridor and had seen a glob of the dead president’s brains on that suit.</p><p class="calibre13">A head-shot president. And all the dead who would come after, standing behind him in a ghostly file that stretched away into infinity.</p><p class="calibre13">I sat back down again and watched Sadie carry her suitcases toward the Frontier Airlines counter. The bags were obviously heavy but she carried them con brio, her back straight, her low heels clicking briskly. The clerk checked them and put them on a baggage trolley. He and Sadie conferred; she passed him the ticket she had bought through a travel agency two months ago, and the clerk scribbled something on it. She took it back and turned for the gate. I lowered my head to make sure she wouldn’t see me. When I looked up again, she was gone.</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">7</span></span></p><p class="calibre21">Forty long, long minutes later, a man, a woman, and two small children—a boy and a girl—passed the restaurant. The boy was holding his father’s hand and chattering away. The father was looking down at him, nodding and smiling. The father was Robert Oswald.</p><p class="calibre13">The loudspeaker blared, “Delta’s flight 194 is now arriving from Newark and Atlanta Municipal Airport. Passengers can be met at Gate 4. Delta Flight 194, now arriving.”</p><p class="calibre13">Robert’s wife—Vada, according to Al’s notes—swept the little girl into her arms and hurried along faster. There was no sign of Marguerite.</p><p class="calibre13">I picked at my salad, chewing without tasting. My heart was beating hard.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">I could hear the approaching roar of engines and saw the white nose of a DC-8 as it pulled up to the gate. Greeters piled up around the door. A waitress tapped me on the shoulder and I almost screamed.</p><p class="calibre13">“Sorry, sir,” she said in a Texas accent that was thick enough to cut. “Jes wanted to ask if I could get y’all anything else.”</p><p class="calibre13">“No,” I said. “I’m fine.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Well, that’s good.”</p><p class="calibre13">The first passengers began cutting across the terminal. They were all men wearing suits and prosperous haircuts. Of course. The first passengers to deplane were always from first class.</p><p class="calibre13">“Sure I can’t get you a piece of peach pah? It’s fresh today.”</p><p class="calibre13">“No thanks.”</p><p class="calibre13">“You sure, hon?”</p><p class="calibre13">Now the coach class passengers came in a flood, all of them festooned with carry-on bags. I heard a woman squeal. Was that Vada, greeting her brother-in-law?</p><p class="calibre13">“I’m sure,” I said, and picked up my magazine.</p><p class="calibre13">She took the hint. I sat stirring the remains of my salad into an orange soup of French dressing and watched. Here came a man and woman with a baby, but the kid was almost a toddler, too old to be June. The passengers passed the restaurant, chattering with the friends and relatives who had come to pick them up. I saw a young man in an Army uniform pat his girlfriend’s bottom. She laughed, slapped his hand, then stood on tiptoe to kiss him.</p><p class="calibre13">For five minutes or so the terminal was almost full. Then the crowd began to thin out. There was no sign of the Oswalds. A wild certainty came to me: they weren’t on the plane. I hadn’t just traveled back in time, I had bounced into some sort of parallel universe. Maybe the Yellow Card Man had been meant to stop something like that from happening, but the Yellow Card Man was dead, and I was off the hook. No Oswald? Fine, no mission. Kennedy was going to die in some other version of America, but not in this one. I could catch up with Sadie and live happily ever after.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">The thought had no more than crossed my mind when I saw my target for the first time. Robert and Lee were side by side, talking animatedly. Lee was swinging what was either an oversized attaché case or a small satchel. Robert had a pink suitcase with rounded corners that looked like something out of Barbie’s closet. Vada and Marina came along behind. Vada had taken one of two patchwork cloth bags; Marina had the other slung over her shoulder. She was also carrying June, now four months old, in her arms and laboring to keep up. Robert and Vada’s two kids flanked her, looking at her with open curiosity.</p><p class="calibre13">Vada called to the men and they stopped almost in front of the restaurant. Robert grinned and took Marina’s carry-bag. Lee’s expression was . . . amused? Knowing? Maybe both. The tiniest suggestion of a smile dimpled the corners of his mouth. His nondescript hair was neatly combed. He was, in fact, the perfect A. J. Squared Away in his pressed white shirt, khakis, and shined shoes. He didn’t look like a man who had just completed a journey halfway around the world; there wasn’t a wrinkle on him and not a trace of beard-shadow on his cheeks. He was just twenty-two years old, and looked younger—like one of the teenagers in my last American Lit class.</p><p class="calibre13">So did Marina, who wouldn’t be old enough to buy a legal drink for another month. She was exhausted, bewildered, and staring at everything. She was also beautiful, with clouds of dark hair and upturned, somehow rueful blue eyes.</p><p class="calibre13">June’s arms and legs were swaddled in cloth diapers. Even her neck was wrapped in something, and although she wasn’t crying, her face was red and sweaty. Lee took the baby. Marina smiled her gratitude, and when her lips parted, I saw that one of her teeth was missing. The others were discolored, one of them almost black. The contrast with her creamy skin and gorgeous eyes was jarring.</p><p class="calibre13">Oswald leaned close to her and said something that wiped the smile off her face. She looked up at him warily. He said something else, poking her shoulder with one finger as he did so. I remembered Al’s story, and wondered if Oswald was saying the same thing to his wife now: <span class="italic">pokhoda, cyka</span>—walk, bitch.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">But no. It was the swaddling that had upset him. He tore it away—first from the arms, then the legs—and flung the diapers at Marina, who caught them clumsily. Then she looked around to see if they were being watched.</p><p class="calibre13">Vada came back and touched Lee’s arm. He paid no attention to her, just unwrapped the makeshift cotton scarf from around baby June’s neck and flung <span class="italic">that</span> at Marina. It fell to the terminal floor. She bent and picked it up without speaking.</p><p class="calibre13">Robert joined them and gave his brother a friendly punch on the shoulder. The terminal had almost entirely cleared out now—the last of the deplaning passengers had passed the Oswald family—and I heard what he said clearly. “Give her a break, she just got here. She doesn’t even know where here is yet.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Look at this kid,” Lee said, and raised June for inspection. At that, she finally began to cry. “She’s got her wrapped up like a damn Egyptian mummy. Because that’s the way they do it back home. I don’t know whether to laugh or cry. <span class="italic">Staryj baba!</span> Old woman.” He turned back to Marina with the bawling baby in his arms. She looked at him fearfully. <span class="italic">“Staryj baba!”</span></p><p class="calibre13">She tried to smile, the way people do when they know the joke is on them, but not why. I thought fleetingly of Lennie, in <span class="italic">Of Mice and Men.</span> Then a grin, cocky and a little sideways, lit Oswald’s face. It made him almost handsome. He kissed his wife gently, first on one cheek, then the other.</p><p class="calibre13">“USA!” he said, and kissed her again. “USA, Rina! Land of the free and home of the turds!”</p><p class="calibre13">Her smile became radiant. He began to speak to her in Russian, handing back the baby as he did so. He put his arm around her waist as she soothed June. She was still smiling as they left my field of vision, and shifted the baby to her shoulder so she could take his hand.</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">8</span></span></p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre21">I went home—if I could call Mercedes Street home—and tried to take a nap. I couldn’t get under, so I lay there with my hands behind my head, listening to the uneasy street noises and speaking with Al Templeton. This was a thing I found myself doing quite often, now that I was on my own. For a dead man, he always had a lot to say.</p><p class="calibre13">“I was stupid to come to Fort Worth,” I told him. “If I try to hook up that bug to the tape recorder, someone’s apt to see me. Oswald himself might see me, and that would change everything. He’s already paranoid, you said so in your notes. He knew the KGB and MVD were watching him in Minsk, and he’s going to be afraid that the FBI and the CIA are watching him here. And the FBI actually <span class="italic">will</span> be, at least some of the time.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Yes, you’ll have to be careful,” Al agreed. “It won’t be easy, but I trust you, buddy. It’s why I called you in the first place.”</p><p class="calibre13">“I don’t even want to get near him. Just seeing him in the airport gave me a class-A case of the willies.”</p><p class="calibre13">“I know you don’t, but you’ll have to. As someone who spent damn near his whole life cooking meals, I can tell you that no omelet was ever made without breaking eggs. And it would be a mistake to overestimate this guy. He’s no super-criminal. Also, he’s going to be distracted, mostly by his batshit mother. How good is he going to be at anything for awhile except shouting at his wife and knocking her around when he gets too pissed off for shouting to be enough?”</p><p class="calibre13">“I think he cares for her, Al. At least a little, and maybe a lot. In spite of the shouting.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Yeah, and it’s guys like him who are most likely to fuck up their women. Look at Frank Dunning. You just take care of your business, buddy.”</p><p class="calibre13">“And what am I going to get if I do manage to hook up that bug? Tape recordings of arguments? Arguments in <span class="italic">Russian</span>? <span class="italic">That’ll</span> be a big help.”</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">“You don’t need to decode the man’s family life. It’s George de Mohrenschildt you need to find out about. You have to make sure de Mohrenschildt isn’t involved in the attempt on General Walker. Once you accomplish that, the window of uncertainty closes. And look on the bright side. If Oswald catches you spying on him, his future actions might change in a <span class="italic">good</span> way. He might not try for Kennedy after all.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Do you really believe that?”</p><p class="calibre13">“No. Actually I don’t.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Neither do I. The past is obdurate. It doesn’t want to be changed.”</p><p class="calibre13">He said, “Buddy, now you’re cooking . . .”</p><p class="calibre13">“With gas,” I heard myself muttering. “Now I’m cooking with gas.”</p><p class="calibre13">I opened my eyes. I had fallen asleep after all. Late light was coming in through the drawn curtains. Somewhere not far away, on Davenport Street in Fort Worth, the Oswald brothers and their wives would be sitting down to dinner—Lee’s first meal back on his old stomping grounds.</p><p class="calibre13">Outside my own little bit of Fort Worth, I could hear a skip-rope chant. It sounded very familiar. I got up, went through my dim living room (furnished with two thrift-shop easy chairs but nothing else), and twitched back one of the drapes an inch or so. Those drapes had been my very first installation. I wanted to see; I didn’t want to be seen.</p><p class="calibre13">2703 was still deserted, with the FOR RENT sign double-tacked to the railing of the rickety porch, but the lawn wasn’t deserted. There, two girls were twirling a jump rope while a third stutter-stepped in and out. Of course they weren’t the girls I’d seen on Kossuth Street in Derry—these three, dressed in patched and faded jeans instead of crisp new shorts, looked runty and underfed—but the chant was the same, only now with Texas accents.</p><p class="calibre13">“Charlie Chaplin went to <span class="italic">France</span>! Just to watch the ladies <span class="italic">dance</span>! Salute to the <span class="italic">Cap’un</span>! Salute to the <span class="italic">Queen</span>! My old man drives a sub-ma-rine!”</p><p class="calibre13">The skip-rope girl caught her foot and went tumbling into the crabgrass that served as 2703’s front lawn. The other girls piled on top of her and all three of them rolled in the dirt. Then they got to their feet and went pelting away.</p><p class="calibre13">I watched them go, thinking <span class="italic">I saw them but they didn’t see me. That’s something. That’s a start.</span>
<span class="italic">But Al, where’s my finish?</span></p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">De Mohrenschildt was the key to the whole deal, the only thing keeping me from killing Oswald as soon as he moved in across the street. George de Mohrenschildt, a petroleum geologist who speculated in oil leases. A man who lived the playboy lifestyle, mostly thanks to his wife’s money. Like Marina, he was a Russian exile, but unlike her, from a noble family—he was, in fact, <span class="italic">Baron</span> de Mohrenschildt. The man who was going to become Lee Oswald’s only friend during the few months of life Oswald had left. The man who was going to suggest to Oswald that the world would be much better off without a certain racist right-wing ex-General. If de Mohrenschildt turned out to be part of Oswald’s attempt to kill Edwin Walker, my situation would be vastly complicated; all the nutty conspiracy theories would then be in play. Al, however, believed all the Russian geologist had done (or <span class="italic">would</span> do; as I’ve said, living in the past is confusing) was egg on a man who was already obsessed with fame and mentally unstable.</p><p class="calibre13">Al had written in his notes: <span class="italic">If Oswald was on his own on the night of April 10<sup class="calibre28"><small class="calibre29"><span class="calibre29">th</span></small></sup>, 1963, chances that there was another gunman involved in the Kennedy assassination seven months later drop to almost zero.</span></p><p class="calibre13">Below this, in capital letters, he had added his final verdict: <span class="italic">GOOD ENOUGH TO TAKE THE SON OF A BITCH OUT.</span></p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">9</span></span></p><p class="calibre21">Seeing the little girls who hadn’t seen me made me think of that old Jimmy Stewart suspenser, <span class="italic">Rear Window.</span> A person could see a lot without ever leaving his own living room. Especially if he had the right tools.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">The next day, I went to a sporting goods store and bought a pair of Bausch &amp; Lomb binoculars, reminding myself to be wary of sunflashes on the lenses. Since 2703 was on the east side of Mercedes Street, I thought I’d be safe enough in that regard anytime after noon. I poked the glasses through the gap in my drapes, and when I adjusted the focus knob, the crappy living room–kitchen across the way became so bright and detailed that I might’ve been standing in it.</p><p class="calibre13">The Leaning Lamp of Pisa was still on the old bureau where the kitchen utensils were stored, waiting for someone to turn it on and activate the bug. But it would do me no good unless it was hooked up to the cunning little Japanese reel-to-reel, which could record up to twelve hours on its slowest speed. I had tried it out, actually speaking into the spare bugged lamp (which made me feel like a character in a Woody Allen comedy), and while the playback was draggy, the words were understandable. All of which meant I was good to go.</p><p class="calibre13">If I dared to.</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">10</span></span></p><p class="calibre21">July Fourth on Mercedes Street was busy. Men with the day off watered lawns that were beyond saving—other than a few afternoon and evening thunderstorms, the weather had been hot and dry—then plopped down in lawn chairs, listening to baseball games on the radio and drinking beer. Subteen posses threw firecrackers at stray dogs and the few roving chickens. One of the latter was struck by a cherry bomb and exploded in a mass of blood and feathers. The child who tossed it was dragged screaming into one of the houses farther down the street by a mother wearing nothing but a slip and a Farmall baseball cap. I guessed by her unsteady gait that she had downed a few brewskis herself. The closest thing to fireworks came just after ten o’clock, when someone, possibly the same kid who slashed my convertible’s tires, torched an old Studebaker that had been sitting abandoned in the parking lot of the Montgomery Ward warehouse for the last week or so. Fort Worth FD came to put it out, and everyone turned out to watch.</p><p class="calibre13">Hail Columbia.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">The next morning I walked down to inspect the burned-out hulk, which sat sadly on the puddled remains of its tires. I spotted a telephone booth near one of the warehouse loading bays, and on impulse called Ellie Dockerty, getting the operator to find the number and connect me. I did it partly because I was lonely and homesick, mostly because I wanted news of Sadie.</p><p class="calibre13">Ellie answered on the second ring, and she seemed delighted to hear my voice. Standing there in an already roasting phone booth, with Mercedes Street sleeping off the Glorious Fourth behind me and the smell of charred car in my nostrils, that made me smile.</p><p class="calibre13">“Sadie’s fine. I’ve had two postcards and a letter. She’s working at Harrah’s as a waitress.” She lowered her voice. “I believe as a <span class="italic">cocktail</span> waitress, but the schoolboard will never hear that from me.”</p><p class="calibre13">I visualized Sadie’s long legs in a short cocktail waitress’s skirt. I visualized businessmen trying to see the tops of her stockings or into the valley of her décolletage as she bent to put drinks on a table.</p><p class="calibre13">“She asked after you,” Ellie said, and that made me smile again. “I didn’t want to tell her that you’d sailed off the edge of the earth as far as anyone in Jodie knew, so I said you were busy with your book and doing fine.”</p><p class="calibre13">I hadn’t added a word to <span class="italic">The Murder Place</span> in a month or more, and on the two occasions when I’d picked up the manuscript and tried to read it, it all seemed to be written in third-century Punic. “I’m glad that she’s doing well.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Her residency requirement will be fulfilled by the end of the month, but she’s decided to stay out there until the end of summer vacation. She says the tips are very good.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Did you ask her for a picture of her soon-to-be ex-husband?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Just before she left. She said she has none. She believes her parents have several, but she refused to write them about it. Said they’d never given up on the marriage, and it would give them false hope. She also said she believed you were overreacting. <span class="italic">Wildly</span> overreacting was the phrase she used.”</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">That sounded like my Sadie. Only she wasn’t mine anymore. Now she was just <span class="italic">hey waitress, bring us another round . . . and bend a little lower this time.</span> Every man has a jealous-bone, and mine was twanging hard on the morning of July fifth.</p><p class="calibre13">“George? I have no doubt she still cares for you, and it might not be too late to clear this mess up.”</p><p class="calibre13">I thought of Lee Oswald, who wouldn’t make his attempt on General Edwin Walker’s life for another nine months. “It’s too early,” I said.</p><p class="calibre13">“I beg pardon?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Nothing. It’s good to talk to you, Miz Ellie, but pretty soon the operator’s going to come on the line asking for more money, and I’m all out of quarters.”</p><p class="calibre13">“I don’t suppose you could get down this way for a burger and a shake, could you? At the diner? If so, I’ll invite Deke Simmons to join us. He asks about you almost every day.”</p><p class="calibre13">The thought of going back to Jodie and seeing my friends from the high school was probably the only thing that could have cheered me up that morning. “Absolutely. Would this evening be too soon? Say five o’clock?”</p><p class="calibre13">“It’s perfect. We country mice eat early.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Fine. I’ll be there. My treat.”</p><p class="calibre13">“I’ll match you for it.”</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">11</span></span></p><p class="calibre21">Al Stevens had hired a girl I knew from Business English, and I was touched by the way she lit up when she saw who was sitting with Ellie and Deke. “Mr. Amberson! Wow, it’s great to see you! How’re you doing?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Fine, Dorrie,” I said.</p><p class="calibre13">“Well, order <span class="italic">big.</span> You’ve lost weight.”</p><p class="calibre13">“It’s true,” Ellie said. “You need a good taking-care-of.”</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">Deke’s Mexican tan was gone, which told me he was spending most of his retirement indoors, and whatever weight I’d lost, he’d found. He shook my hand with a hard grip and told me how good it was to see me. There was no artifice in the man. Or in Ellie Dockerty, for that matter. Leaving this place for Mercedes Street, where they celebrated the Fourth by blowing up chickens, began to seem increasingly mad to me, no matter what I knew about the future. I certainly hoped Kennedy was worth it.</p><p class="calibre13">We ate hamburgers, french fries sizzling with grease, and apple pie à la mode. We talked about who was doing what, and had a laugh over Danny Laverty, who was finally writing his long-bruited book. Ellie said that according to Danny’s wife, the first chapter was titled “I Enter the Fray.”</p><p class="calibre13">Toward the end of the meal, as Deke stuffed his pipe with Prince Albert, Ellie lifted a tote she had stored under the table and produced a large book, which she passed above the greasy remains of our meal. “Page eighty-nine. And push back from that unsightly puddle of ketchup, if you please. This is strictly on loan, and I want to send it back in the same condition I received it.”</p><p class="calibre13">It was a yearbook called <span class="italic">Tiger Tails,</span> and had come from a school a lot more fancy-schmancy than DCHS. <span class="italic">Tiger Tails</span> was bound in leather instead of cloth, the pages were thick and glossy, and the ad section at the back was easily a hundred pages thick. The institution it memorialized—<span class="italic">exalted</span> might be a better word—was Longacre Day School in Savannah. I thumbed through the uniformly vanilla senior section and thought there might be a black face or two there by the year 1990. Maybe.</p><p class="calibre13">“Holy joe,” I said. “Sadie must have taken a pretty good whack in the wallet when she came to Jodie from here.”</p><p class="calibre13">“I believe she was very anxious to get away,” Deke said quietly. “And I’m sure she had her reasons.”</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">I turned to page eighty-nine. It was headed LONGACRE SCIENCE DEPARTMENT. There was a corny group shot of four teachers in white lab coats holding bubbling beakers—paging Dr. Jekyll—and below it were four studio shots. John Clayton didn’t look a bit like Lee Oswald, but he had the same sort of pleasantly forgettable face, and his lips were dimpled at the corners by the same suggestion of a smile. Was that the ghost of amusement or barely hidden contempt? Hell, maybe it was just the best the obsessive-compulsive bastard could do when the photographer told him to say cheese. The only distinguishing features were hollows at the temples, which almost matched the dimples at the corners of his mouth. The photo wasn’t color, but his eyes were light enough to make me pretty sure they were either blue or gray.</p><p class="calibre13">I turned the book toward my friends. “See these indents on the sides of his head? Is that just a natural formation, like a hooked nose or a chin-dimple?”</p><p class="calibre13">They said “No” at exactly the same time. It was sort of comical.</p><p class="calibre13">“They’re forceps marks,” Deke said. “Made when some doc finally got tired of waiting and dragged him out of his mama. They usually go away, but not always. If his hair wasn’t thinning on the sides, you wouldn’t see them at all, would you?”</p><p class="calibre13">“And he hasn’t been around, asking about Sadie?” I asked.</p><p class="calibre13">“No.” They said it in unison again. Ellen added, “No one’s been asking after her. Except for you, George. You damned fool.” She smiled as people do when it’s a joke, but not really.</p><p class="calibre13">I looked at my watch and said, “I’ve kept you folks long enough. I’ll be heading on back.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Want to take a stroll down to the football field before you go?” Deke asked. “Coach Borman said to bring you by, if I got a chance. He’s got them practicing already, of course.”</p><p class="calibre13">“In the cool of the evening, at least,” Ellie said, getting up. “Thank God for small favors. Remember when the Hastings boy got a heatstroke three years ago, Deke? And how they thought it was a heart attack at first?”</p><p class="calibre13">“I can’t imagine why he’d want to see me,” I said. “I turned one of his prize defensemen to the dark side of the universe.” I lowered my voice and whispered hoarsely, <span class="italic">“Theater arts!”</span></p><p class="calibre13">Deke smiled. “Yeah, but you saved another one from maybe getting red-shirted at ’Bama. Or at least that’s what Borman thinks. Because, my son, that’s what Jim LaDue told him.”</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">At first I didn’t have any idea what he was talking about. Then I remembered the Sadie Hawkins, and grinned. “All I did was catch three of them passing a bottle of rotgut. I threw it over the fence.”</p><p class="calibre13">Deke had stopped smiling. “One of those boys was Vince Knowles. Did you know he was drunk when he rolled that truck of his?”</p><p class="calibre13">“No.” But it didn’t surprise me. Cars and booze have always been a popular and sometimes lethal high school cocktail.</p><p class="calibre13">“Yessir. That, combined with whatever you said to those boys at the dance, got LaDue to swear off drinking.”</p><p class="calibre13">“What <span class="italic">did</span> you say?” Ellie asked. She was fumbling her wallet out of her purse, but I was too lost in the memory of that night to argue with her about the check. <span class="italic">Do not fuck up your futures:</span> that was what I’d said. And Jim LaDue, he of the lazy I’ve-got-the-world-on-a-string smile, had actually taken it to heart. We never know which lives we influence, or when, or why. Not until the future eats the present, anyway. We know when it’s too late.</p><p class="calibre13">“I don’t remember,” I said.</p><p class="calibre13">Ellie trotted off to pay the check.</p><p class="calibre13">I said, “Tell Miz Dockerty to keep an eye out for the man in that picture, Deke. You too. He may not come around, I’m starting to think I could’ve been wrong about that, but he might. And he’s not wrapped too tightly.”</p><p class="calibre13">Deke promised he would.</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">12</span></span></p><p class="calibre21">I almost didn’t walk over to the football field. Jodie was particularly beautiful in the slanting light of that early July evening and I think part of me wanted to get my ass back to Fort Worth before I lost the will to go there. I wonder how much would have changed if I had skipped that little side trip? Maybe nothing. Maybe a lot.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">Coach was running a final two or three plays with the special teams kids while the rest of the players sat on the bench with their helmets off and sweat trickling down their faces. <span class="italic">“Red two, red two!”</span> Coach shouted. He saw Deke and me and lifted a spread hand: <span class="italic">five minutes.</span> Then he turned back to the small and weary squad still on the field. <span class="italic">“One more time! Let’s see you make that daring leap from no-ass to poor-ass, what do you say?”</span></p><p class="calibre13">I looked across the field and saw a guy in a sport coat loud enough to scream. He was trotting up and down the sidelines with earphones on his head and what looked like a salad bowl in his hands. His glasses reminded me of someone. At first I couldn’t make the connection, then I did: he looked a little like Silent Mike McEachern. My own personal Mr. Wizard.</p><p class="calibre13">“Who’s that?” I asked Deke.</p><p class="calibre13">Deke squinted. “Damn if I know.”</p><p class="calibre13">Coach clapped his hands and told his kids to shower up. He walked over to the bleachers and clapped me on the back. “Howza goin, Shakespeare?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Pretty good,” I said, smiling gamely.</p><p class="calibre13">“Shakespeare, kick in the rear, that’s what we used to say when we were kids.” He laughed heartily.</p><p class="calibre13">“<span class="italic">We</span> used to say Coach, Coach, step on a roach.”</p><p class="calibre13">Coach Borman looked puzzled. “Really?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Nah, just goofin witcha.” And sort of wishing I’d acted on my first impulse and scooted out of town after supper. “How does the team look?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Aw, they good boys, they goan try hard, but it won’t be the same without Jimmy. Did you see the new billboard out there where 109 splits off from Highway 77?” Only he said it <span class="italic">seb’ny-seb’n.</span></p><p class="calibre13">“Too used to it to notice, I guess.”</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">“Well, have a look on the way out, podna. Boosters done it up right. Jimmy’s mama ’bout cried when she saw it. I understand I owe you a vote a thanks for gettin that young man to swear off the drinkin.” He removed his cap with the big <span class="bold">C</span> on it, armed sweat from his forehead, put it back on, and sighed heavily. “Probably owe that fuckin nummie Vince Knowles a vote a thanks, too, but puttin him on my prayer list is the best I can do.”</p><p class="calibre13">I recalled that Coach was a Baptist of the hard-shell variety. In addition to prayer lists, he probably believed all that shit about Noah’s sons.</p><p class="calibre13">“No thanks necessary,” I said. “Just doing my job.”</p><p class="calibre13">He looked at me keenly. “You ought to still be doing it, not jerking off over some book. Sorry if that’s too blunt, but it’s how I feel.”</p><p class="calibre13">“That’s all right.” It was. I liked him better for saying it. In another world, he might even have been right. I pointed across the field, where the Silent Mike look-alike was packing his salad bowl into a steel case. His earphones were still hanging around his neck. “Who’s that, Coach?”</p><p class="calibre13">Coach snorted. “Think his name is Hale Duff. Or maybe it’s Cale. New sports guy at the Big Damn.” He was talking about KDAM, Denholm County’s one radio station, a teensy sundowner that ran farm reports in the morning, country music in the afternoons, and rock after school let out. The kids enjoyed the station breaks as much as the music; there would be an explosion followed by an old cowboy type saying, “K-DAM! <span class="italic">That</span> was a big ’un!” In the Land of Ago, this is considered the height of risqué wit.</p><p class="calibre13">“What’s that contraption of his, Coach?” Deke asked. “Do you know?”</p><p class="calibre13">“I know, all right,” Coach said, “and if he thinks I’m gonna let him use it during a game broadcast, he’s out of his sneaker. Think I want ever’one who’s got a radio hearin me call my boys a bunch of goddam pussies when they can’t deny the rush on third and short?”</p><p class="calibre13">I turned to him, very slowly. “What are you talking about?”</p><p class="calibre13">“I didn’t believe him, so I tried it myself,” the Coach said. Then, with mounting indignation: “I heard Boof Redford tellin one of the freshmen that my balls were bigger than my brains!”</p><p class="calibre13">“Really,” I said. My heartbeat had picked up appreciably.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">“Duffer there said he built it in his goddam garage,” Coach grumbled. “Said when it’s turned up to full gain, you can hear a cat fart on the next block. <span class="italic">That’s</span> bullshit, accourse, but Redford was on the other side of the field when I heard him make his smart remark.”</p><p class="calibre13">The sports guy, who looked all of twenty-four, picked up his steel equipment case and waved with his free hand. Coach waved back, then muttered under his breath, “The gameday I let him on my field with <span class="italic">that</span> thing will be the day I put a Kennedy sticker on my fucking Dodge.”</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">13</span></span></p><p class="calibre21">It was almost dark when I got to the intersection of 77 and 109, but a bloated orange moon was rising in the east, and it was good enough to see the billboard. It was Jim LaDue, smiling with his football helmet in one hand, a pigskin in the other, and a lock of black hair tumbled heroically over his forehead. Above the picture, in star-spangled letters, was CONGRATULATIONS TO JIM LADUE, ALL-STATE QUARTERBACK 1960 AND 1961! GOOD LUCK AT ALABAMA!
