There was a drugstore on the main drag, and it was open, but I saw a WE ROAR FOR THE DENHOLM LIONS sticker on the door and remembered Round Hill was part of Consolidated District Four. I drove on to Kileen. There, an elderly druggist who bore an eerie but probably coincidental resemblance to Mr. Keene back in Derry winked at me as he gave me a brown bag and my change. “Don’t do anything against the law, son.”</p><p class="calibre13">I returned the wink in the expected fashion and drove back to Jodie. I’d had a late night, but when I lay down and tried to nap, I didn’t even get in sleep’s neighborhood. So I went to the Weingarten’s and bought a poundcake after all. It looked Sunday-stale, but I didn’t care and didn’t think Sadie would, either. Picnic supper or no picnic supper, I was pretty sure food wasn’t the number one item on today’s agenda. When I knocked on her door, there was a whole cloud of butterflies in my stomach.</p><p class="calibre13">Sadie’s face was free of makeup. She wasn’t even wearing lipstick. Her eyes were large, dark, and frightened. For one moment I was sure she was going to slam the door in my face and I’d hear her running away just as fast as her long legs would carry her. And that would be that.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">But she didn’t run. “Come on in,” she said. “I made chicken salad.” Her lips began to tremble. “I hope you like . . . you like p-plenty of m-may—”</p><p class="calibre13">Her knees started to buckle. I dropped the box with the poundcake inside on the floor and grabbed her. I thought she was going to faint, but she didn’t. She put her arms around my neck and held tight, like a drowning woman to a floating log. I could feel her body thrumming. I stepped on the goddamned poundcake. Then she did.<span class="italic"> Squoosh.</span></p><p class="calibre13">“I’m scared,” she said. “What if I’m no good at it?”</p><p class="calibre13">“What if I’m not?” This was not entirely a joke. It had been a long time. At least four years.</p><p class="calibre13">She didn’t seem to hear me. “He never wanted me. Not the way I expected. And his way is the only way I know. The touching, then the broom.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Calm down, Sadie. Take a deep breath.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Did you go to the drugstore?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Yes, in Kileen. But we don’t have to—”</p><p class="calibre13">“We do. <span class="italic">I</span> do. Before I lose what little courage I have left. Come on.”</p><p class="calibre13">Her bedroom was at the end of the hall. It was spartan: a bed, a desk, a couple of prints on the walls, chintz curtains dancing in the soft breath of the window air-conditioning unit, turned down to low. Her knees started to give way again and I caught her again. It was a weird kind of swing-dancing. There were even Arthur Murray footprints on the floor. Poundcake. I kissed her and her lips fastened on mine, dry and frantic.</p><p class="calibre13">I pushed her away gently and braced her back against the closet door. She looked at me solemnly, her hair in her eyes. I brushed it away, then—very gently—began to lick her dry lips with the tip of my tongue. I did it slowly, being sure to get the corners.</p><p class="calibre13">“Better?” I asked.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">She answered not with her voice but with her own tongue. Without pressing my body against hers, I began to very slowly run my hand up and down the long length of her, from where I could feel the rapid beat of her pulse on both sides of her throat, to her chest, her breasts, her stomach, the flat tilted plane of her pubic bone, around to one buttock, then down to her thigh. She was wearing jeans. The fabric whispered under my palm. She leaned back and her head bonked on the door.</p><p class="calibre13">“Ouch!” I said. “Are you all right?”</p><p class="calibre13">She closed her eyes. “I’m fine. Don’t stop. Kiss me some more.” Then she shook her head. “No, don’t kiss me. Do my lips again. Lick me. I like that.”</p><p class="calibre13">I did. She sighed and slipped her fingers under my belt at the small of my back. Then around to the front, where the buckle was.</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">2</span></span></p><p class="calibre21">I wanted to go fast, every part of me was yelling for speed, telling me to plunge deep, wanting that perfect <span class="italic">gripping</span> sensation that is the essence of the act, but I went slow. At least at first. Then she said, “Don’t make me wait, I’ve had enough of that,” and so I kissed the sweaty hollow of her temple and moved my hips forward. As if we were doing a horizontal version of the Madison. She gasped, retreated a little, then raised her own hips to meet me.</p><p class="calibre13">“Sadie? All right?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Ohmygodyes,” she said, and I laughed. She opened her eyes and looked up at me with curiosity and hopefulness. “Is it over, or is there more?”</p><p class="calibre13">“A little more,” I said. “I don’t know how much. I haven’t been with a woman in a long time.”</p><p class="calibre13">It turned out there was quite a bit more. Only a few minutes in real time, but sometimes time is different—as no one knew better than I. At the end she began to gasp. “Oh dear, oh my dear, oh my dear dear God, oh <span class="italic">sugar</span>!”</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">It was the sound of greedy discovery in her voice that put me over the edge, so it wasn’t quite simultaneous, but a few seconds later she lifted her head and buried her face in the hollow of my shoulder. A small fisted hand beat on my shoulder blade once, twice . . . then opened like a flower and lay still. She dropped back onto the pillows. She was staring at me with a stunned, wide-eyed expression that was a little scary.</p><p class="calibre13">“I came,” she said.</p><p class="calibre13">“I noticed.”</p><p class="calibre13">“My mother told me it didn’t happen for women, only for men. She said orgasms for women were a myth.” She laughed shakily. “Oh my God, what she was missing.”</p><p class="calibre13">She got up on one elbow, then took one of my hands and put it on her breast. Beneath it, her heart was pounding and pounding. “Tell me, Mr. Amberson—how soon before we can do it again?”</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">3</span></span></p><p class="calibre21">As the reddening sun sank into the everlasting gas-and oil-smog to the west, Sadie and I sat in her tiny backyard under a nice old pecan tree, eating chicken salad sandwiches and drinking iced tea. No poundcake, of course. The poundcake was a total loss.</p><p class="calibre13">“Is it bad for you, having to wear those . . . you know, those drugstore things?”</p><p class="calibre13">“It’s fine,” I said. It really wasn’t, and never had been. There would be improvements in a great many American products between 1961 and 2011, but take it from Jake, rubbers stay pretty much the same. They may have fancier names and even a taste-component (for those with peculiar tastes), but they remain essentially a girdle you snap on over your dick.</p><p class="calibre13">“I used to have a diaphragm,” she said. There was no picnic table, so she had spread a blanket on the grass. Now she picked up a Tupperware container with the remains of a cucumber-and-onion salad inside it and began snapping the lid open and closed, a form of fidgeting some people would have considered Freudian. Including me.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">“My mother gave it to me a week before Johnny and I were married. She even told me how to put it in, although she couldn’t look me in the eye, and if you’d flicked a drop of water on one of her cheeks, I’m sure it would’ve sizzled. ‘Don’t start a baby for the first eighteen months,’ she said. ‘Two years, if you can make him wait. That way you can live on his salary and save yours.’”</p><p class="calibre13">“Not the world’s worst advice.” I was being cautious. We were in a minefield. She knew it as well as I did.</p><p class="calibre13">“Johnny’s a science teacher. He’s tall, although not quite as tall as you are. I was tired of going places with men who were shorter than me, and I think that’s why I said yes when he first asked me out. Eventually, going out with him got to be a habit. I thought he was nice, and at the end of the night he never seemed to grow an extra pair of hands. At the time, I thought those things were love. I was very naïve, wasn’t I?”</p><p class="calibre13">I made a seesaw gesture with my hand.</p><p class="calibre13">“We met at Georgia Southern and then got jobs at the same high school in Savannah. Coed, but private. I’m pretty sure his daddy pulled a wire or two to make that happen. The Claytons don’t have money—not anymore, although they did once—but they’re still high in Savannah society. Poor but genteel, you know?”</p><p class="calibre13">I didn’t—questions of who was in society and who wasn’t were never big issues when I was growing up—but I murmured an assent. She had been sitting on top of this for a long time, and looked almost hypnotized.</p><p class="calibre13">“So I had a diaphragm, yes I did. In its own little plastic lady-box with a rose on the cover. Only I never used it. Never had to. Finally threw it in the trash after one of those getting-it-outs. That’s what he called it, getting it out. ‘I have to get it out,’ he used to say. Then the broom. You see?”</p><p class="calibre13">I didn’t see at all.</p><p class="calibre13">Sadie laughed, and I was again reminded of Ivy Templeton. “Wait two years, she said! We could have waited <span class="italic">twenty,</span> and no diaphragm required!”</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">“What happened?” I gripped her upper arms lightly. “Did he beat you? Beat you with a broomhandle?” There was another way a broomhandle could be used—I’d read <span class="italic">Last Exit to Brooklyn</span>—but apparently he hadn’t done that. She had been a virgin, all right; the proof was on the sheets.</p><p class="calibre13">“No,” she said. “The broom wasn’t for beating. George, I don’t think I can talk about this anymore. Not now. I feel . . . I don’t know . . . like a bottle of soda that’s been shaken up. Do you know what I want?”</p><p class="calibre13">I thought so, but did the polite thing and asked.</p><p class="calibre13">“I want you to take me inside, and then take the cap off.” She raised her hands over her head and stretched. She hadn’t bothered putting her bra back on, and I could see her breasts lift under her blouse. Her nipples made tiny shadows, like punctuation marks, against the cloth in the late light.</p><p class="calibre13">She said, “I don’t want to relive the past today. Today I only want to fizz.”</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">4</span></span></p><p class="calibre21">An hour later I saw she was drowsing. I kissed her first on the forehead and then on the nose to wake her up. “I have to go. If only to get my car out of your driveway before your neighbors start to call their friends.”</p><p class="calibre13">“I suppose so. It’s the Sanfords next door, and Lila Sanford is this month’s student librarian.”</p><p class="calibre13">And I was pretty sure that Lila’s father was on the schoolboard, but I didn’t say so. Sadie was glowing, and there was no need to spoil that. For all the Sanfords knew, we were sitting on the couch with our knees together, waiting for <span class="italic">Dennis the Menace</span> to finish and Ed Sullivan’s rilly big shew to come on. If my car was still in Sadie’s driveway at eleven, their perceptions might change.</p><p class="calibre13">She watched me dress. “What happens now, George? With us?”</p><p class="calibre13">“I want to be with you if you want to be with me. Is that what you want?”</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">She sat up, the sheet puddled around her waist, and reached for her cigarettes. “Very much. But I’m married, and that won’t change until next summer in Reno. If I tried for an annulment, Johnny would fight me. Hell, his <span class="italic">parents</span> would fight me.”</p><p class="calibre13">“If we’re discreet, everything will be fine. But we have to be discreet. You know that, right?”</p><p class="calibre13">She laughed and lit up. “Oh yes. I know that.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Sadie, have you had discipline problems in the library?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Huh? Some, sure. The usual.” She shrugged; her breasts bobbed; I wished I hadn’t dressed quite so fast. On the other hand, who was I kidding? James Bond might’ve been up for a third go-round, but Jake/George was tapped out. “I’m the new girl in school. They’re testing me. It’s a pain in the keister, but nothing I didn’t expect. Why?”</p><p class="calibre13">“I think your problems are about to vanish. Students love it when teachers fall in love. Even the boys. It’s like a TV show to them.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Will they know that we’ve . . .”</p><p class="calibre13">I thought about it. “Some of the girls will. The ones with experience.”</p><p class="calibre13">She huffed out smoke. “Great.” But she didn’t look entirely displeased.</p><p class="calibre13">“How about dinner out at The Saddle in Round Hill? Get people used to seeing us as a couple.”</p><p class="calibre13">“All right. Tomorrow?”</p><p class="calibre13">“No, I have something to do in Dallas tomorrow.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Research for your book?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Uh-huh.” Here we were, brand-new, and I was lying already. I didn’t like it, but saw no way around it. As for the future . . . I refused to think about that now. I had my own glow to protect. “Tuesday?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Yes. And George?”</p><p class="calibre13">“What?”</p><p class="calibre13">“We have to find a way to keep doing this.”</p><p class="calibre13">I smiled. “Love will find a way.”</p><p class="calibre13">“I think this part is more lust.”</p><p class="calibre13">“It’s both, maybe.”</p><p class="calibre13">“You’re a sweet man, George Amberson.”</p><p class="calibre13">Christ, even the name was a lie.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">“I’ll tell you about Johnny and me. When I can. And if you want to hear.”</p><p class="calibre13">“I want to.” I thought I had to. If this was going to work, I had to understand. About her. About him. About the broom. “When you’re ready.”</p><p class="calibre13">“As our esteemed principal likes to say, ‘Students, this will be challenging but worthwhile.’”</p><p class="calibre13">I laughed.</p><p class="calibre13">She butted out her cigarette. “One thing I wonder about. Would Miz Mimi approve of us?”</p><p class="calibre13">“I’m pretty sure she would.”</p><p class="calibre13">“I think so, too. Drive home safe, my dear. And you better take those.” She was pointing at the paper bag from the Kileen Pharmacy. It was sitting on top of her dresser. “If I had the kind of nosy company who checks the medicine cabinet after they tee-tee, I’d have some explaining to do.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Good idea.”</p><p class="calibre13">“But keep them handy, honey.”</p><p class="calibre13">And she winked.</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">5</span></span></p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre21">On the way home, I found myself thinking about those rubbers. Trojan brand . . . and ribbed for <span class="italic">her</span> pleasure, according to the box. The lady didn’t have a diaphragm any longer (although I guessed she might arrange for one on her next trip to Dallas), and birth control pills wouldn’t be widely available for another year or two. Even then, doctors would be wary about prescribing them, if I remembered my Modern Sociology course correctly. So for now it was Trojans. I wore them not for her pleasure but so she wouldn’t have a baby. Which was amusing when you considered that I wouldn’t be a baby myself for another fifteen years.</p><p class="calibre13">Thinking about the future is confusing in all sorts of ways.</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">6</span></span></p><p class="calibre21">The following evening I revisited Silent Mike’s establishment. The sign in the door was turned to CLOSED and the place looked empty, but when I knocked, my electronics buddy let me in.</p><p class="calibre13">“Right on time, Mr. Doe, right on time,” he said. “Let’s see what you think. Me, I think I outdid myself.”</p><p class="calibre13">I stood by the glass case filled with transistor radios and waited while he disappeared into the back room. He returned holding a lamp in each hand. The shades were grimy, as if they had been adjusted by a great many dirty fingers. The base of one was chipped so it stood crooked on the counter: the Leaning Lamp of Pisa. They were perfect, and I told him so. He grinned and put two of the boxed tape recorders next to the lamps. Also a drawstring bag containing several lengths of wire so thin it was almost invisible.</p><p class="calibre13">“Want a little tutorial?”</p><p class="calibre13">“I think I’ve got it,” I said, and put five twenties down on the counter. I was a little touched when he tried to push one back.</p><p class="calibre13">“One-eighty was the price we agreed on.”</p><p class="calibre13">“The other twenty is for you to forget I was ever here.”</p><p class="calibre13">He considered this for a moment, then put a thumb on the stray twenty and pulled it into the group with its little green friends. “I already did that. Why don’t I consider this a tip?”</p><p class="calibre13">As he put the stuff into a brown paper bag, I was struck by simple curiosity and asked him a question.</p><p class="calibre13">“Kennedy? I didn’t vote for him, but as long as he doesn’t go taking his orders from the Pope, I think he’ll be okay. The country needs somebody younger. It’s a new age, y’know?”</p><p class="calibre13">“If he were to come to Dallas, do you think he’d be all right?”</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">“Probably. Can’t say for sure, though. On the whole, if I were him, I’d stay north of the Mason-Dixon line.”</p><p class="calibre13">I grinned. “Where all is calm, all is bright?”</p><p class="calibre13">Silent Mike (Holy Mike) said, “Don’t start.”</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">7</span></span></p><p class="calibre21">There was a rack of pigeonholes for mail and school announcements in the first-floor teachers’ room. On Tuesday morning, during my free period, I found a small sealed envelope in mine.</p><blockquote class="calibre24"><span class="italic">Dear George—</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre24"><span class="italic">If you still want to take me to dinner tonight, it will have to be five-ish, because I’ll have early mornings all this week and next, getting ready for the Fall Book Sale. Perhaps we could come back to my place for dessert.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre24"><span class="italic">I have poundcake, if you’d like a slice.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre26"><span class="italic">Sadie</span></blockquote><p class="calibre13">“What are you laughing about, Amberson?” Danny Laverty asked. He was correcting themes with a hollow-eyed intensity that suggested hangover. “Tell me, I could use a giggle.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Nah,” I said. “Private joke. You wouldn’t get it.”</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">8</span></span></p><p class="calibre21">But <span class="italic">we</span> got it, poundcake became our name for it, and we ate plenty that fall.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">We were discreet, but of course there were people who knew what was going on. There was probably some gossip, but no scandal. Smalltown folks are rarely mean folks. They knew Sadie’s situation, at least in a general way, and understood we could make no public commitment, at least for awhile. She didn’t come to my house; that would have caused the wrong kind of talk. I never stayed beyond ten o’clock at hers; that also would have caused the wrong kind of talk. There was no way I could have put my Sunliner in her garage and stayed the night, because her Volkswagen Beetle, small as it was, filled it almost wall-to-wall. I wouldn’t have done so in any case, because someone would have known. In small towns, they always do.</p><p class="calibre13">I visited her after school. I dropped by for the meal she called supper. Sometimes we went to Al’s Diner and ate Prongburgers or catfish fillets; sometimes we went to The Saddle; twice I took her to the Saturday-night dances at the local Grange. We saw movies at the Gem in town or at the Mesa in Round Hill or the Starlite Drive-In in Kileen (which the kids called the submarine races). At a nice restaurant like The Saddle, she might have a glass of wine before dinner and I might have a beer with, but we were careful not to be seen at any of the local taverns and certainly not at the Red Rooster, Jodie’s one and only jukejoint, a place our students talked about with longing and awe. It was 1961 and segregation might finally be softening in the middle—Negroes had won the right to sit at the Woolworth’s lunchcounters in Dallas, Fort Worth, and Houston—but schoolteachers didn’t drink in the Red Rooster. Not if they wanted to keep their jobs. Never-never-never.</p><p class="calibre13">When we made love in Sadie’s bedroom, she always kept a pair of slacks, a sweater, and a pair of moccasins on her side of the bed. She called it her emergency outfit. The one time the doorbell bonged while we were naked (a state she had taken to calling <span class="italic">in flagrante delicious</span>), she got into those threads in ten seconds flat. She came back, giggling and waving a copy of <span class="italic">The Watchtower.</span> “Jehovah’s Witnesses. I told them I was saved and they went away.”</p><p class="calibre13">Once, as we ate ham-steaks and okra in her kitchen afterward, she said our courtship reminded her of that movie with Audrey Hepburn and Gary Cooper—<span class="italic">Love in the Afternoon.</span> “Sometimes I wonder if it would be better at night.” She said this a little wistfully. “When regular people do it.”</p><p class="calibre13">“You’ll get a chance to find out,” I said. “Hang in there, baby.”</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">She smiled and kissed the corner of my mouth. “You turn some cool phrases, George.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Oh yes,” I said, “I’m very original.”</p><p class="calibre13">She pushed her plate aside. “I’m ready for dessert. How about you?”</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">9</span></span></p><p class="calibre21">Not long after the Jehovah’s Witnesses came calling at Sadie’s place—this must have been early November, because I’d finished casting my version of <span class="italic">Twelve Angry Men</span>—I was out raking my lawn when someone said, “Hello, George, how’s it going?”</p><p class="calibre13">I turned around and saw Deke Simmons, now a widower for the second time. He had stayed in Mexico longer than anyone had thought he would, and just when folks began to believe he was going to remain there, he had come back. This was the first time I’d seen him. He was very brown, but far too thin. His clothes bagged on him, and his hair—iron-gray on the day of the wedding reception—was now almost all white and thinning on top.</p><p class="calibre13">I dropped my rake and hurried over to him. I meant to shake his hand, but hugged him instead. It startled him—in 1961, Real Men Don’t Hug—but then he laughed.</p><p class="calibre13">I held him at arm’s length. “You look great!”</p><p class="calibre13">“Nice try, George. But I feel better than I did. Meems dying . . . <br class="calibre6"/>I knew it was going to happen, but it still knocked me for a loop. Head could never get through to heart on that one, I reckon.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Come on in and have a cup of coffee.”</p><p class="calibre13">“I’d like that.”</p><p class="calibre13">We talked about his time in Mexico. We talked about school. We talked about the undefeated football team and the upcoming fall play. Then he put down his cup and said, “Ellen Dockerty asked me to pass on a word or two about you and Sadie Clayton.”</p><p class="calibre13">Uh-oh. And I’d thought we were doing so well.</p><p class="calibre13">“She goes by Dunhill now. It’s her maiden name.”</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">“I know all about her situation. Knew when we hired her. She’s a fine girl and you’re a fine man, George. Based on what Ellie tells me, the two of you are handling a difficult situation with a fair amount of grace.”</p><p class="calibre13">I relaxed a little.</p><p class="calibre13">“Ellie said she was pretty sure neither of you knew about Candlewood Bungalows just outside of Kileen. She didn’t feel right about telling you, so she asked if I would.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Candlewood Bungalows?”</p><p class="calibre13">“I used to take Meems there on a lot of Saturday nights.” He was fiddling at his coffee cup with hands that now looked too big for his body. “It’s run by a couple of retired schoolteachers from Arkansas or Alabama. One of those <span class="italic">A</span>-states, anyway. Retired <span class="italic">men</span> schoolteachers. If you know what I mean.”</p><p class="calibre13">“I think I’m following, yes.”</p><p class="calibre13">“They’re nice fellows, very quiet about their own relationship and about the relationships of some of their guests.” He looked up from his coffee cup. He was blushing a little, but also smiling. “This isn’t a hot-sheet joint, if that’s what you’re thinking. Farthest thing from it. The rooms are nice, the prices are reasonable, and the little restaurant down the road is a-country fare. Sometimes a gal needs a place like that. And maybe a man does, too. So they don’t have to be in such a hurry. And so they won’t feel cheap.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Thank you,” I said.</p><p class="calibre13">“Very welcome. Mimi and I had many pleasant evenings at the Candlewood. Sometimes we only watched the TV in our pajamas and then went to bed, but that can be as good as anything else when you get to a certain age.” He smiled ruefully. “Or almost. We’d go to sleep listening to the crickets. Or sometimes a coyote would howl, very far away, out in the sage. At the moon, you know. They really do that. They howl at the moon.”</p><p class="calibre13">He took a handkerchief from his back pocket with an old man’s slowness and mopped his cheeks with it.</p><p class="calibre13">I offered my hand and Deke took hold.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">“She liked you, although she never could figure out what to make of you. She said you reminded her of the way they used to show ghosts in those old movies from the thirties. ‘He’s bright and shiny, but not all here,’ she said.”</p><p class="calibre13">“I’m no ghost,” I said. “I promise you.”</p><p class="calibre13">He smiled. “No? I finally got around to checking your references. This was after you’d been subbing for us awhile and did such a bang-up job with the play. The ones from the Sarasota School District are fine, but beyond there . . .” He shook his head, still smiling. “And your degree is from a mill in Oklahoma.”</p><p class="calibre13">Clearing my throat did no good. I couldn’t speak at all.</p><p class="calibre13">“And what’s that to me, you ask? Not much. There was a time in this part of the world when if a man rode into town with a few books in his saddlebags, spectacles on his nose, and a tie around his neck, he could get hired on as schoolmaster and stay for twenty years. Wasn’t that long ago, either. You’re a damn fine teacher. The kids know it, I know it, and Meems knew it, too. And that’s a <span class="italic">lot</span> to me.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Does Ellen know I faked my other references?” Because Ellen Dockerty was acting principal, and once the schoolboard met in January, the job would be hers permanently. There were no other candidates.</p><p class="calibre13">“Nope, and she’s not going to. Not from me, at least. I feel like she doesn’t need to.” He stood up. “But there’s one person who <span class="italic">does</span> need to know the truth about where you’ve been and what you’ve done, and that’s a certain lady librarian. If you’re serious about her, that is. Are you?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Yes,” I said, and Deke nodded as if that took care of everything.</p><p class="calibre13">I only wished it did.</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">10</span></span></p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre21">Thanks to Deke Simmons, Sadie finally got to find out what it was like to make love after sundown. When I asked her how it was, she told me it had been wonderful. “But I’m looking forward to waking up next to you in the morning even more. Do you hear the wind?”</p><p class="calibre13">I did. It hooted around the eaves.</p><p class="calibre13">“Doesn’t that sound make you feel cozy?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Yes.”</p><p class="calibre13">“I’m going to say something now. I hope it doesn’t make you uncomfortable.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Tell me.”</p><p class="calibre13">“I guess I’ve fallen in love with you. Maybe it’s just the sex, I’ve heard that’s a mistake people make, but I don’t think so.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Sadie?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Yes?” She was trying to smile, but she looked frightened.</p><p class="calibre13">“I love you, too. No maybe or mistake about it.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Thank God,” she said, and snuggled close.</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">11</span></span></p><p class="calibre21">On our second visit to the Candlewood Bungalows, she was ready to talk about Johnny Clayton. “But turn out the light, would you?”</p><p class="calibre13">I did as she asked. She smoked three cigarettes during the telling. Toward the end, she cried hard, probably not from remembered pain so much as simple embarrassment. For most of us, I think it’s easier to admit doing wrong than being stupid. Not that she had been. There’s a world of difference between stupidity and naïveté, and like most good middle-class girls who came to maturity in the nineteen-forties and-fifties, Sadie knew almost nothing about sex. She said she had never actually looked at a penis until she had looked at mine. She’d had glimpses of Johnny’s, but she said if he caught her looking, he would take hold of her face and turn it away with a grip that stopped just short of painful.</p><p class="calibre13">“But it always <span class="italic">did</span> hurt,” she said. “You know?”</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">John Clayton came from a conventionally religious family, nothing nutty about them. He was pleasant, attentive, reasonably attractive. He didn’t have the world’s greatest sense of humor (almost none might have been closer to the mark), but he seemed to adore her. Her parents adored <span class="italic">him.</span> Claire Dunhill was especially crazy about Johnny Clayton. And, of course, he was taller than Sadie, even when she was in heels. After years of beanpole jokes, that was important.</p><p class="calibre13">“The only troubling thing before the marriage was his compulsive neatness,” Sadie said. “He had all his books alphabetized, and he got very upset if you moved them around. He was nervous if you took even one off the shelf—you could feel it, a kind of tensing. He shaved three times a day and washed his hands all the time. If someone shook with him, he’d make an excuse to rush off to the lav and wash just as soon as he could.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Also color-coordinated clothes,” I said. “On his body and in the closet, and woe to the person who moved them around. Did he alphabetize the stuff in the pantry? Or get up sometimes in the night to check that the stove burners were off and the doors were locked?”</p><p class="calibre13">She turned to me, her eyes wide and wondering in the dark. The bed squeaked companionably; the wind gusted; a loose windowpane rattled. “How do you know that?”</p><p class="calibre13">“It’s a syndrome. Obsessive-compulsive disorder. OCD, for short. Howard—” I stopped. <span class="italic">Howard Hughes has a bad case of it,</span> I’d started to say, but maybe that wasn’t true yet. Even if it was, people probably didn’t know. “An old friend of mine had it. Howard Temple. Never mind. Did he hurt you, Sadie?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Not really, no beating or punching. He slapped me once, that’s all. But people hurt people in other ways, don’t they?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Yes.”</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">“I couldn’t talk to anyone about it. Certainly not my mother. Do you know what she told me on my wedding day? That if I said half a prayer before and half a prayer during, everything would be fine. <span class="italic">During</span> was as close as she could come to the word <span class="italic">intercourse.</span> I tried to talk to my friend Ruthie about it, but only once. This was after school, and she was helping me pick up the library. ‘What goes on behind the bedroom door is none of my business,’ she said. I stopped, because I didn’t really <span class="italic">want</span> to talk about it. I was so ashamed.”</p><p class="calibre13">Then it came in a rush. Some of what she said was blurred by tears, but I got the gist. On certain nights—maybe once a week, maybe twice—he would tell her he needed to “get it out.” They would be lying side by side in bed, she in her nightgown (he insisted she wear ones that were opaque), he in a pair of boxer shorts. Boxers were the closest she ever came to seeing him naked. He would push the sheet down to his waist, and she would see his erection tenting them.</p><p class="calibre13">“Once he looked at that little tent himself. Only once that I remember. And do you know what he said?”</p><p class="calibre13">“No.”</p><p class="calibre13">“‘How disgusting we are.’ Then he said, ‘Get it over with so I can get some sleep.’”</p><p class="calibre13">She would reach beneath the sheet and masturbate him. It never took long, sometimes only seconds. On a few occasions he touched her breasts as she performed this function, but mostly his hands remained knotted high on his chest. When it was over, he would go into the bathroom, wash himself off, and come back in wearing his pajamas. He had seven pairs, all blue.</p><p class="calibre13">Then it was her turn to go into the bathroom and wash her hands. He insisted that she do this for at least three minutes, and under water hot enough to turn her skin red. When she came back to bed, she held her palms out to his face. If the smell of Lifebuoy wasn’t strong enough to satisfy him, she would have to do it again.</p><p class="calibre13">“And when I came back, the broom would be there.”</p><p class="calibre13">He would put it on top of the sheet if it was summer, on the blankets if it was winter. Running straight down the middle of the bed. His side and her side.</p><p class="calibre13">“If I was restless and happened to move it, he’d wake up. No matter how fast asleep he was. And he’d push me back to my side. Hard. He called it ‘transgressing the broom.’”</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">The time he slapped her was when she asked how they would ever have children if he never put it in her. “He was furious. That’s why he slapped me. He apologized later, but what he said right then was, ‘Do you think I’d put myself in your germy womanhole and bring children into this filthy world? It’s all going to blow up anyway, anyone who reads the paper can see that coming, and the radiation will kill us. We’ll die with sores all over our bodies, and coughing up our lungs. It could happen any day.’”</p><p class="calibre13">“Jesus. No wonder you left him, Sadie.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Only after four wasted years. It took me that long to convince myself that I deserved more from life than color-coordinating my husband’s sock drawer, giving him handjobs twice a week, and sleeping with a goddam broom. That was the most humiliating part, the part I was sure I could never talk about to anyone . . . because it was <span class="italic">funny.</span>”</p><p class="calibre13">I didn’t think it was funny. I thought it was somewhere in the twilight zone between neurosis and outright psychosis. I also thought I was listening to the perfect Fifties Fable. It was easy to imagine Rock Hudson and Doris Day sleeping with a broom between them. If Rock hadn’t been gay, that was.</p><p class="calibre13">“And he hasn’t come looking for you?”</p><p class="calibre13">“No. I applied to a dozen different schools and had the answers sent to a post office box. I felt like a woman having an affair, sneaking around. And that’s how my mother and father treated me when they found out. My dad has come around a little—I think he suspects how bad it was, although of course he doesn’t want to know any of the details—but my mother? Not her. She’s furious with me. She had to change churches and quit the Sewing Bee. Because she couldn’t hold her head up, she says.”</p><p class="calibre13">In a way, this seemed as cruel and crazy as the broom, but I didn’t say so. A different aspect of the matter interested me more than Sadie’s conventional Southern parents. “<span class="italic">Clayton</span> didn’t tell them you were gone? Have I got that right? Never came to see them?”</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">“No. My mother understood, of course.” Sadie’s ordinarily faint Southern accent deepened. “I just shamed that poor boy so bad that he didn’t want to tell <span class="italic">anyone.</span>” She dropped the drawl. “I’m not being sarcastic, either. She understands shame, and she understands covering up. On those two things, Johnny and my mama are in perfect harmony.<span class="italic"> She’s</span> the one he should have married.” She laughed a little hysterically. “Mama probably would have <span class="italic">loved</span> that old broom.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Never a word from him? Not even a postcard saying, ‘Hey Sadie, let’s tie up the loose ends so we can get on with our lives?’”</p><p class="calibre13">“How could there be? He doesn’t know where I am, and I’m sure he doesn’t care.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Is there anything you want from him? Because I’m sure a lawyer—”</p><p class="calibre13">She kissed me. “The only thing I want is here in bed with me.”</p><p class="calibre13">I kicked the sheets down to our ankles. “Look at me, Sadie. No charge.”</p><p class="calibre13">She looked. And then she touched.</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">12</span></span></p><p class="calibre21">I drowsed afterward. Not deep—I could still hear the wind and that one rattling windowpane—but I got far enough down to dream. Sadie and I were in an empty house. We were naked. Something was moving around upstairs—it made thudding, unpleasant noises. It might have been pacing, but it seemed as if there were too many feet. I didn’t feel guilty that we were going to be discovered with our clothes off. I felt scared. Written in charcoal on the peeling plaster of one wall were the words I WILL KILL THE PRESIDENT SOON. Below it, someone had added NOT SOON ENOUGH HES FULL OF DISEEZE. This had been printed in dark lipstick. Or maybe it was blood.</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="italic">Thud, clump, thud.</span></p><p class="calibre13">From overhead.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">“I think it’s Frank Dunning,” I whispered to Sadie. I gripped her arm. It was very cold. It was like gripping the arm of a dead person. A woman who had been beaten to death with a sledgehammer, perhaps.</p><p class="calibre13">Sadie shook her head. She was looking up at the ceiling, her mouth trembling.</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="italic">Clud, thump, clud.</span></p><p class="calibre13">Plaster-dust sifting down.</p><p class="calibre13">“Then it’s John Clayton,” I whispered.</p><p class="calibre13">“No,” she said. “I think it’s the Yellow Card Man. He brought the Jimla.”</p><p class="calibre13">Above us, the thudding stopped abruptly.</p><p class="calibre13">She took hold of my arm and began to shake it. Her eyes were eating up her face. “It is! It’s the Jimla! And it heard us! <span class="italic">The Jimla knows we’re here!</span>”</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">13</span></span></p><p class="calibre21">“Wake up, George! Wake up!”</p><p class="calibre13">I opened my eyes. She was propped on one elbow beside me, her face a pale blur. “What? What time is it? Do we have to go?” But it was still dark and the wind was still high.</p><p class="calibre13">“No. It isn’t even midnight. You were having a bad dream.” She laughed, a little nervously. “Maybe about football? Because you were saying ‘Jimla, Jimla.’”</p><p class="calibre13">“Was I?” I sat up. There was the scrape of a match and her face was momentarily illuminated as she lit a cigarette.</p><p class="calibre13">“Yes. You were. You said all kinds of stuff.”</p><p class="calibre13">That was not good. “Like what?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Most of it I couldn’t make out, but one thing was pretty clear. ‘Derry is Dallas,’ you said. Then you said it backwards. ‘Dallas is Derry.’ What was <span class="italic">that</span> about? Do you remember?”</p><p class="calibre13">“No.” But it’s hard to lie convincingly when you’re fresh out of sleep, even a shallow doze, and I saw skepticism on her face. Before it could deepen into disbelief, there was a knock at the door. At quarter to midnight, a knock.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">We stared at each other.</p><p class="calibre13">The knock came again.</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="italic">It’s the Jimla.</span> This thought was very clear, very certain.</p><p class="calibre13">Sadie put her cigarette in the ashtray, gathered the sheet around her, and ran to the bathroom without a word. The door shut behind her.</p><p class="calibre13">“Who is it?” I asked.</p><p class="calibre13">“It’s Mr. Yorrity, sir—Bud Yorrity?”</p><p class="calibre13">One of the gay retired teachers who ran the place.</p><p class="calibre13">I got out of bed and pulled on my pants. “What is it, Mr. Yorrity?”</p><p class="calibre13">“I have a message for you, sir. Lady said it was urgent.”</p><p class="calibre13">I opened the door. He was a small man in a threadbare bathrobe. His hair was a sleep-frizzed cloud around his head. In one hand he held a piece of paper.</p><p class="calibre13">“What lady?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Ellen Dockerty.”</p><p class="calibre13">I thanked him for his trouble and closed the door. I unfolded the paper and read the message.</p><p class="calibre13">Sadie came out of the bathroom, still clutching the sheet. Her eyes were wide and frightened. “What is it?”</p><p class="calibre13">“There’s been an accident,” I said. “Vince Knowles rolled his pickup truck outside of town. Mike Coslaw and Bobbi Jill were with him. Mike was thrown clear. He has a broken arm. Bobbi Jill has a nasty cut on her face, but Ellie says she’s okay otherwise.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Vince?”</p><p class="calibre13">I thought of the way everyone said Vince drove—as if there were no tomorrow. Now there wasn’t. Not for him. “He’s dead, Sadie.”</p><p class="calibre13">Her mouth dropped open. “He can’t be! <span class="italic">He’s only eighteen years old!</span>”</p><p class="calibre13">“I know.”</p><p class="calibre13">The sheet fell free of her relaxing arms and puddled around her feet. She put her hands over her face.</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">14</span></span></p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre21">My revised version of <span class="italic">Twelve Angry Men</span> was canceled. What took its place was <span class="italic">Death of a Student,</span> a play in three acts: the viewing at the funeral parlor, the service at Grace Methodist Church, the graveside service at West Hill Cemetery. This mournful show was attended by the whole town, or near enough to make no difference.</p><p class="calibre13">The parents and Vince’s stunned kid sister starred at the viewing, sitting in folding chairs beside the coffin. When I approached them with Sadie at my side, Mrs. Knowles rose and put her arms around me. I was almost overwhelmed by the odors of White Shoulders perfume and Yodora antiperspirant.</p><p class="calibre13">“You changed his life,” she whispered in my ear. “He told me so. For the first time he made his grades, because he wanted to act.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Mrs. Knowles, I’m so, so sorry,” I said. Then a terrible thought crossed my mind and I hugged her tighter, as if hugging could make it go away: <span class="italic">Maybe it’s the butterfly effect. Maybe Vince is dead because I came to Jodie.</span></p><p class="calibre13">The coffin was flanked by photomontages of Vince’s too-brief life. On an easel in front of it, all by itself, was a picture of him in his <span class="italic">Of Mice and Men</span> costume and that battered old felt hat from props. His ratty, intelligent face peered out from beneath. Vince really hadn’t been much of an actor, but that photo caught him wearing an absolutely perfect wiseass smile. Sadie began to sob, and I knew why. Life turns on a dime. Sometimes toward us, but more often it spins away, flirting and flashing as it goes: <span class="italic">so long, honey, it was good while it lasted, wasn’t it?</span></p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">And Jodie <span class="italic">was</span> good—good for me. In Derry I was an outsider, but Jodie was home. Here’s home: the smell of the sage and the way the hills flush orange with Indian blanket in the summer. The faint taste of tobacco on Sadie’s tongue and the squeak of the oiled wood floorboards in my homeroom. Ellie Dockerty caring enough to send us a message in the middle of the night, perhaps so we could get back to town undiscovered, probably just so we’d know. The nearly suffocating mixture of perfume and deodorant as Mrs. Knowles hugged me. Mike putting his arm—the one not buried in a cast—around me at the cemetery, then pressing his face against my shoulder until he could get himself under control again. The ugly red slash on Bobbi Jill’s face is home, too, and thinking that unless she had plastic surgery (which her family could not afford), it would leave a scar that would remind her for the rest of her life of how she had seen a boy from just down the road dead at the side of the road, his head mostly torn off his shoulders. Home is the black armband that Sadie wore, that I wore, that the whole faculty wore for a week after. And Al Stevens posting Vince’s photo in the window of his diner. And Jimmy LaDue’s tears as he stood up in front of the whole school and dedicated the undefeated season to Vince Knowles.</p><p class="calibre13">Other things, too. People saying howdy on the street, people giving me a wave from their cars, Al Stevens taking Sadie and me to the table at the back that he had started calling “our table,” playing cribbage on Friday afternoons in the teachers’ room with Danny Laverty for a penny a point, arguing with elderly Miss Mayer about who gave the better newscast, Chet Huntley and David Brinkley, or Walter Cronkite. My street, my shotgun house, getting used to using a typewriter again. Having a best girl and getting S&amp;H Green Stamps with my groceries and real butter on my movie popcorn.</p><p class="calibre13">Home is watching the moon rise over the open, sleeping land and having someone you can call to the window, so you can look together. Home is where you dance with others, and dancing is life.</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">15</span></span></p><p class="calibre21">The Year of Our Lord 1961 was winding down. On a drizzly day about two weeks before Christmas, I came into my house after school, once more bundled into my rawhide ranch coat, and heard the phone ringing.</p><p class="calibre13">“This is Ivy Templeton,” a woman said. “You prob’ly don’t even remember me, do you?”</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">“I remember you very well, Miz Templeton.”</p><p class="calibre13">“I dunno why I even bothered to call, that goddam ten bucks is long since spent. Just somethin about you stuck in my head. Rosette, too. She calls you ‘the man who cotched my ball.’”</p><p class="calibre13">“You’re moving out, Miz Templeton?”</p><p class="calibre13">“That’s one hunderd percent goddam right. My mama’s comin up from Mozelle tomorrow in the truck.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Don’t you have a car? Or did it break down?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Car’s runnin okay for a junker, but Harry ain’t goan be ridin in it. Or drivin it ever again. He was workin one of those goddam Manpower jobs last month. Fell in a ditch and a gravel truck run over him while it was backin up. Broke his spine.”</p><p class="calibre13">I closed my eyes and saw the smashed remains of Vince’s truck being hauled down Main Street behind the wrecker from Gogie’s Sunoco. Blood all over the inside of the cracked windshield. “I’m sorry to hear that, Miz Templeton.”</p><p class="calibre13">“He goan live but he ain’t never goan walk again. He goan sit in a wheelchair and pee in a bag, that’s what <span class="italic">he</span> goan do. But first he’s goan ride down Mozelle in the back of my mama’s truck. We’ll steal the mattress out’n the bedroom for him to lay on. Be like takin your dog on vacation, won’t it?”</p><p class="calibre13">She started to cry.</p><p class="calibre13">“I’m runnin out on two months’ back rent, but that don’t confront me none. You know what <span class="italic">does</span> confront me, Mr. Puddentane, Ask Me Again and I’ll Tell You the Same? I got thirty-five goddam dollars and that’s the end of it. Goddam asshole Harry, if he could’ve kep his feet I wouldn’t be in this fix. I thought I was in one before, but now looka this!”</p><p class="calibre13">There was a long, watery snork in my ear.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">“You know what? The mailman been givin me the glad eye, and I think for twenty dollars I’d roll him a fuck on the goddam livin room floor. If the goddam neighbors across the street couldn’t watch us while we ’us goin at it. Can’t very well take him in the bedroom, can I? That’s where my brokeback husband is.” She rasped out a laugh. “Tell you what, why don’t you come on over in your fancy convertible? Take me to a motel sommers. Spend a little extra, get one with a settin-room. Rosette can watch TV and I’ll roll <span class="italic">you</span> a fuck. You looked like you ’us doing okay.”</p><p class="calibre13">I said nothing. I’d just had an idea that was as bright as a flashbulb.</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="italic">If the goddam neighbors across the street couldn’t watch us goin at it.</span></p><p class="calibre13">There was a man <span class="italic">I</span> was supposed to be watching for. Besides Oswald himself, that was. A man whose name also happened to be George, and who was going to become Oswald’s only friend.</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="italic">Don’t trust him,</span> Al had written in his notes.</p><p class="calibre13">“You there, Mr. Puddentane? No? If not, fuck you and goodb—”</p><p class="calibre13">“Don’t hang up, Miz Templeton. Suppose I were to pay your back rent and throw in a hundred bucks on top of that?” It was far more than I needed to pay for what I wanted, but I had it and she needed it.</p><p class="calibre13">“Mister, right now I’d do you with my <span class="italic">father</span> watchin for two hundred bucks.”</p><p class="calibre13">“You don’t have to do me at all, Miz Templeton. All you have to do is meet me in that parking lot at the end of the street. And bring me something.”</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">16</span></span></p><p class="calibre21">It was dark by the time I got to the parking lot of the Montgomery Ward warehouse, and the rain had started to thicken a little, the way it does when it’s trying to be sleet. That doesn’t happen often in the hill country south of Dallas, but sometimes isn’t never. I hoped I could make it back to Jodie without sliding off the road.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">Ivy was sitting behind the wheel of a sad old sedan with rusty rocker panels and a cracked rear window. She got into my Ford and immediately leaned toward the heater vent, which was going full blast. She was wearing two flannel shirts instead of a coat, and shivering.</p><p class="calibre13">“Feels good. That Chev’s colder’n a witch’s tit. Heater’s bust. You bring the money, Mr. Puddentane?”</p><p class="calibre13">I gave her an envelope. She opened it and riffled through some of the twenties that had been sitting on the top shelf of my closet ever since I’d collected on my World Series bet at Faith Financial over a year before. She lifted her substantial bottom off the seat, shoved the envelope into the back pocket of her jeans, then fumbled in the breast pocket of the shirt closer to her body. She brought out a key and slapped it into my hand.</p><p class="calibre13">“That do you?”</p><p class="calibre13">It did me very well. “It’s a dupe, right?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Just like you told me. I had it made at the hardware store on McLaren Street. Why you want a key to that glorified shithouse? For two hundred, you could rent it for four months.”</p><p class="calibre13">“I’ve got my reasons. Tell me about the neighbors across the street. The ones that could watch you and the mailman doing it on the living room floor.”</p><p class="calibre13">She shifted uneasily and pulled her shirts a little closer across her equally substantial bosom. “I was just jokin about that.”</p><p class="calibre13">“I know.” I didn’t, and I didn’t care. “I just want to know if the neighbors can really see into your living room.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Course they can, and I could see into theirs, if they didn’t have curtains. Which I woulda bought for our place, could I afford em. When it comes to privacy, we all might as well be livin outside. I s’pose I coulda put up burlap, scavenged it from right over there”—she pointed to the trash bins lined up against the east side of the warehouse—“but it looks so slutty.”</p><p class="calibre13">“The neighbors with the view live at what? Twenty-seven-oh-four?”</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">“Twenty-seven-oh-six. It used to be Slider Burnett n his fambly, but they moved out just after Halloween. He was a substitute rodeo clown, do you believe it? Who knew there was such a job? Now it’s some fella named Hazzard and his two kids and I think his mother. Rosette won’t play with the kids, says they’re dirty. Which is a newsflash comin from <span class="italic">that</span> little pigpen. Ole grammy tries to talk and it comes out all mush. Side of her face won’t move. Dunno what help she can be to him, draggin around like she does. If I get like that, just shoot me. Eeee, doggies!” She shook her head. “Tell you one thing, they won’t be there long. No one stays on ’Cedes Street. Got a cigarette? I had to give em up. When you can’t afford a quarter for fags, that’s when you know for sure you’re on your goddam uppers.”</p><p class="calibre13">“I don’t smoke.”</p><p class="calibre13">She shrugged. “What the hell. I can afford my own now, can’t I? I’m goddam rich. You ain’t married, are you?”</p><p class="calibre13">“No.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Got a girlfriend, though. I can smell perfume on this side of the car. The nice stuff.”</p><p class="calibre13">That made me smile. “Yes, I’ve got a girlfriend.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Good for you. Does she know you’re sneakin around the south side of Fort Worth after dark, doin funny business?”</p><p class="calibre13">I said nothing, but sometimes that’s answer enough.</p><p class="calibre13">“Nev’ mind. That’s between you n her. I’m warm now, so I’ll go on back. If it’s still rainy n cold like this tomorrow, I don’t know what we’re goan do about Harry in the back of my ma’s truck.” She looked at me, smiling. “When I was a kid I used to think I was gonna grow up to be Kim Novak. Now Rosette, she thinks she’s goan replace Darlene on the Mouseketeers. Hidey-fuckin-ho.”</p><p class="calibre13">She started to open the door and I said, “Wait.”</p><p class="calibre13">I raked the crap out of my pockets—Life Savers, Kleenex, a book of matches Sadie had tucked in there, notes for a freshman English test I meant to give before the Christmas break—and then gave her the ranch coat. “Take this.”</p><p class="calibre13">“I ain’t takin your goddam coat!” She looked shocked.</p><p class="calibre13">“I’ve got another one at home.” I didn’t, but I could buy one, and that was more than she could do.</p><p class="calibre13">“What’m I gonna tell Harry? That I found it under a goddam cabbage leaf ?”</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">I grinned. “Tell him you rolled the mailman a fuck and bought it with the proceeds. What’s he going to do, chase you down the driveway and beat you up?”</p><p class="calibre13">She laughed, a harsh rainbird caw that was strangely charming. And took the coat.</p><p class="calibre13">“Regards to Rosette,” I said. “Tell her I’ll see her in her dreams.”</p><p class="calibre13">She stopped smiling. “I hope not, mister. That one she had about you was a nightmare. Bout screamed the house down, she did. Woke me out of a dead sleep at two in the morning. She said the man who cotched her ball had a monster in the backseat of his car, and she was afraid it would eat her up. Scared the life out of me, she did, screamin like that.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Did the monster have a name?” Of course it did.</p><p class="calibre13">“She said it was a jimla. Prob’ly meant a jinny, like in those stories about Aladdin and the Seven Veils. Anyway, I gotta go. You take care of yourself.”</p><p class="calibre13">“You too, Ivy. Merry Christmas.”</p><p class="calibre13">She cawed her rainbird laugh again. “Almost forgot about that. You have one, too. Don’t forget to give your girl a present.”</p><p class="calibre13">She trotted to her old car with my coat—her coat, now—thrown over her shoulders. I never saw her again.</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">17</span></span></p><p class="calibre21">The rain only froze on the bridges, and I knew from my other life—the one in New England—to be careful on those, but it was still a long drive back to Jodie. I had no more than put the water on for a cup of tea when the phone rang. This time it was Sadie.</p><p class="calibre13">“I’ve been trying to get you since suppertime to ask you about Coach Borman’s Christmas Eve bash. It starts at three. I’ll go if you want to take me, because then we can get away early. Say we’ve got dinner reservations at The Saddle, or something. I need to RSVP, though.”</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">I saw my own invitation lying next to my typewriter, and felt a little twinge of guilt. It had been there for three days, and I hadn’t even opened it.</p><p class="calibre13">“Do you want to go?” I asked.</p><p class="calibre13">“I wouldn’t mind making an appearance.” There was a pause. “Where have you been all this time?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Fort Worth.” I almost added, <span class="italic">Christmas shopping.</span> But I didn’t. The only thing I’d bought in Fort Worth was some information. And a housekey.</p><p class="calibre13">“Were you shopping?”</p><p class="calibre13">Again I had to fight not to lie. “I . . . Sadie, I really can’t say.”</p><p class="calibre13">There was a long, long pause. I found myself wishing I smoked. Probably I had developed a contact addiction. God knew I was smoking by proxy all day, every day. The teachers’ room was a constant blue haze.</p><p class="calibre13">“Is it a woman, George? Another woman? Or am I being nosy?”</p><p class="calibre13">Well, there was Ivy, but that wasn’t the kind of woman she was talking about.</p><p class="calibre13">“In the woman department, there’s only you.”</p><p class="calibre13">Another of those long, long pauses. In the world, Sadie could move carelessly; in her head, she never did. At last she said, “You know a lot about me, things I never thought I could tell anyone, but I know almost nothing about you. I guess I just realized that. Sadie can be stupid, George, can’t she?”</p><p class="calibre13">“You’re not stupid. And one thing you <span class="italic">do</span> know is that I love you.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Yes . . .” She sounded doubtful. I remembered the bad dream I’d had that night at the Candlewood Bungalows, and the caution I’d seen in her face when I told her I didn’t remember it. Was that same look on her face now? Or perhaps an expression a little deeper than mere caution?</p><p class="calibre13">“Sadie? Are we all right?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Yes.” Sounding a little more sure now. “Sure we are. Except for Coach’s party. What do you want to do about it? Remember that the whole darn School Department will be there, and most of them will be drunk on their fannies by the time Mrs. Coach puts on the buffet.”</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">“Let’s go,” I said, too heartily. “Party down and kick out the jams.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Kick out the <span class="italic">what</span>?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Have some fun. That’s all I meant. We’ll pop in for an hour, maybe an hour and a half, then pop back out. Dinner at The Saddle. That work for you?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Fine.” We were like a couple negotiating for a second date after the first one had been inconclusive. “We’ll enjoy ourselves.”</p><p class="calibre13">I thought about Ivy Templeton smelling the ghost of Sadie’s perfume and asking if my girl knew I was sneaking around south Fort Worth after dark, doing funny business. I thought about Deke Simmons saying there was one person who deserved to know the truth about where I’d been and what I’d done. But was I going to tell Sadie I’d killed Frank Dunning in cold blood so he wouldn’t murder his wife and three of his four children? That I had come to Texas to prevent an assassination and change the course of history? That I knew I could do that because I came from a future where we could have been IM’ing this conversation via computer?</p><p class="calibre13">“Sadie, this is going to work out. I promise you that.”</p><p class="calibre13">Again she said, “Fine.” Then she said, “I’ll see you tomorrow, George, in school.” And hung up, very gently and politely.</p><p class="calibre13">I held the telephone in my hand for several seconds, staring straight ahead at nothing. A rattling began on the windows facing my backyard. The rain had turned to sleet after all.</p><div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_30"></div></body>
