<a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">CHAPTER 30</span></span></p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">1</span></span></p><p class="calibre21">I stepped off my final Greyhound at the Minot Avenue station in Auburn, Maine, at a little past noon on the twenty-sixth of November. After more than eighty hours of almost nonstop riding, relieved only by short intervals of sleep, I felt like a figment of my own imagination. It was cold. God was clearing His throat and spitting casual snow from a dirty gray sky. I had bought some jeans and a couple of blue chambray workshirts to replace the kitchen-whites, but such clothes weren’t nearly enough. I had forgotten the Maine weather during my time in Texas, but my body remembered in a hurry and started to shiver. I made Louie’s for Men my first stop, where I found a sheepskin-lined coat in my size and took it to the clerk.</p><p class="calibre13">He put down his copy of the Lewiston <span class="italic">Sun</span> to wait on me, and I saw my picture—yes, the one from the DCHS yearbook—on the front page. WHERE IS GEORGE AMBERSON? the headline demanded. The clerk rang up the sale and scribbled me a receipt. I tapped my picture. “What in the world do you suppose is up with that guy?”</p><p class="calibre13">The clerk looked at me and shrugged. “He doesn’t want the publicity and I don’t blame him. I love my wife a whole darn bunch, and if she died sudden, I wouldn’t want people taking my picture for the papers or putting my weepy mug on TV. Would you?”</p><p class="calibre13">“No,” I said, “I guess not.”</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">“If I were that guy, I wouldn’t come up for air until 1970. Let the ruckus die down. How about a nice cap to go with that coat? I got some flannel ones that just came in yesterday. The earflaps are good and thick.”</p><p class="calibre13">So I bought a cap to go with my new coat. Then I limped the two blocks back to the bus station, swinging my suitcase at the end of my good arm. Part of me wanted to go to Lisbon Falls right that minute and make sure the rabbit-hole was still there. But if it was, I’d use it, I wouldn’t be able to resist, and after five years in the Land of Ago, the rational part of me knew I wasn’t ready for the full-on assault of what had become, in my mind, the Land of Ahead. I needed some rest first. Real rest, not dozing in a bus seat while little kids wailed and tipsy men laughed.</p><p class="calibre13">There were four or five taxis parked at the curb, in snow that was now swirling instead of just spitting. I got into the first one, relishing the warm breath from the heater. The cabbie turned around, a fat guy with a badge reading LICENSED LIVERY on his battered cap. He was a complete stranger to me, but I knew that when he turned on the radio, it would be tuned to WJAB out of Portland, and when he dragged his ciggies out of his breast pocket, they would be Lucky Strikes. What goes around comes around.</p><p class="calibre13">“Where to, chief?”</p><p class="calibre13">I told him to take me to the Tamarack Motor Court, out on 196.</p><p class="calibre13">“You got it.”</p><p class="calibre13">He turned on the radio and got the Miracles, singing “Mickey’s Monkey.”</p><p class="calibre13">“These modern dances!” he grunted, grabbing his smokes. “They don’t do nothing but teach the kids how to bump n wiggle.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Dancing is life,” I said.</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">2</span></span></p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre21">It was a different desk clerk, but she gave me the same room. Of course she did. The rate was a little higher and the old TV had been replaced by a newer one, but the same sign was propped against the rabbit ears on top:<span class="italic"> DO NOT USE “TINFOIL!”</span> The reception was still shitty. There was no news, only soap operas.</p><p class="calibre13">I turned it off. I put the DO NOT DISTURB sign on the door. I drew the curtains. Then I stripped and crawled into bed, where—aside from a dreamlike stumble to the bathroom to relieve my bladder—I slept for twelve hours. When I woke up, it was the middle of the night, the power was off, and a strong northwest wind was blowing outside. A brilliant crescent moon rode high in the sky. I got the extra blanket from the closet and slept for another five hours.</p><p class="calibre13">When I woke up, dawn lit the Tamarack Motor Court with the clear hues and shadows of a <span class="italic">National Geographic</span> photograph. There was frost on the cars pulled up in front of a scattering of units, and I could see my breath. I tried the phone, expecting nothing, but a young man in the office answered promptly, although he sounded as if he were still half-asleep. Sure, he said, the phones were fine and he’d be happy to call me a taxi—where did I want to go?</p><p class="calibre13">Lisbon Falls, I told him. Corner of Main Street and the Old Lewiston Road.</p><p class="calibre13">“The Fruit?” he asked.</p><p class="calibre13">I’d been away so long that for a moment it seemed like a total non sequitur. Then it clicked. “That’s right. The Kennebec Fruit.”</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="italic">Going home,</span> I told myself. <span class="italic">God help me, I’m going home.</span></p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">Only that was wrong—2011 wasn’t home, and I would only be staying there a short time—assuming, that was, I could get there at all. Perhaps only minutes. Jodie was home now. Or would be, once Sadie arrived there. Sadie the virgin. Sadie with her long legs and long hair and her propensity to trip over anything that might be in the way . . . only at the critical moment, I was the one who had taken the fall.</p><p class="calibre13">Sadie, with her unmarked face.</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="italic">She</span> was home.</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">3</span></span></p><p class="calibre21">That morning’s taxi driver was a solidly built woman in her fifties, bundled into an old black parka and wearing a Red Sox hat instead of one with a badge reading LICENSED LIVERY. As we turned left onto 196, in the direction of The Falls, she said: “D’ja hear the news? I bet you didn’t—the power’s off up this way, ennit?”</p><p class="calibre13">“What news is that?” I asked, although a dreadful certainty had already stolen into my bones: Kennedy was dead. I didn’t know if it had been an accident, a heart attack, or an assassination after all, but he was dead. The past was obdurate and Kennedy was dead.</p><p class="calibre13">“Earthquake in Los Angeles.” She pronounced it <span class="italic">Las Angle-ees.</span> “People been sayin for years that California was just gonna drop off into the ocean, and it seems like maybe they’re gonna turn out to be right.” She shook her head. “I ain’t gonna say it’s because of the loose way they live—those movie stars and all—but I’m a pretty good Baptist, and I ain’t gonna say it’s not.”</p><p class="calibre13">We were passing the Lisbon Drive-In now. CLOSED FOR THE SEASON, the marquee read. SEE YOU WITH LOTS MORE IN ’64!</p><p class="calibre13">“How bad was it?”</p><p class="calibre13">“They’re saying seven thousand dead, but when you hear a number like that, you know it’ll go higher. Most of the damn bridges fell down, the freeways are in pieces, and there’s fires everywhere. Seems like the part of town where the Negroes live has pretty much burnt flat. Warts! Ain’t that a hell of a name for a part of a town? I mean, even one where black folks live? Warts! Huh!”</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">I didn’t reply. I was thinking of Rags, the puppy we’d had when I was nine, and still living in Wisconsin. I was allowed to play with him in the backyard on school mornings until the bus came. I was teaching him to sit, fetch, roll over, stuff like that, and he was learning—smart puppy! I loved him a lot.</p><p class="calibre13">When the bus came, I was supposed to close the backyard gate before I ran to get on board. Rags always lay down on the kitchen stoop. My mother would call him in and feed him breakfast after she got back from taking my dad to the local train station. I always remembered to close the gate—or at least, I don’t remember ever <span class="italic">forgetting</span> to do it—but one day when I came home from school, my mother told me Rags was dead. He’d been in the street and a delivery truck had run him down. She never reproached me with her mouth, not once, but she reproached me with her eyes. Because <span class="italic">she</span> had loved Rags, too.</p><p class="calibre13">“I closed him in like always,” I said through my tears, and—as I say—I believe that I did. Maybe because I always <span class="italic">had.</span> That evening my dad and I buried him in the backyard. <span class="italic">Probably not legal,</span> Dad said, <span class="italic">but I won’t tell if you won’t.</span></p><p class="calibre13">I lay awake for a long, long time that night, haunted by what I couldn’t remember and terrified of what I might have done. Not to mention guilty. That guilt lingered a long time, a year or more. If I could have remembered for sure, one way or the other, I’m positive it would have left me more quickly. But I couldn’t. Had I shut the gate, or hadn’t I? Again and again I cast my mind to my puppy’s final morning and could remember nothing clearly except heaving his rawhide strip and yelling, “Fetch, Rags, fetch!”</p><p class="calibre13">It was like that on my taxi ride to The Falls. First I tried to tell myself that there always <span class="italic">had</span> been an earthquake in late November of 1963. It was just one of those factoids—like the attempted assassination of Edwin Walker—that I had missed. As I’d told Al Templeton I majored in English, not history.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">It wouldn’t wash. If an earthquake like that had happened in the America I’d lived in before going down the rabbit-hole, I would have known. There were far bigger disasters—the Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004 killed over two hundred thousand—but seven thousand was a big number for America, more than twice as many fatalities as had occurred on 9/11.</p><p class="calibre13">Next I asked myself how what I’d done in Dallas could possibly have caused what this sturdy woman claimed had happened in LA. The only answer I could come up with was the butterfly effect, but how could it kick into gear so <span class="italic">soon</span>? No way. Absolutely not. There was no conceivable chain of cause and effect between the two events.</p><p class="calibre13">And still a deep part of my mind whispered, <span class="italic">You did this. You caused Rags’s death by either leaving the backyard gate open or not closing it firmly enough to latch . . . and you caused this. You and Al spouted a lot of noble talk about saving thousands of lives in Vietnam, but this is your first real contribution to the New History: seven thousand dead in LA.</span></p><p class="calibre13">It simply couldn’t be. Even if it was. . . .</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="italic">There’s no downside,</span> Al had said. <span class="italic">If things turn to shit, you just take it all back. Easy as erasing a dirty word off a chalkb—</span></p><p class="calibre13">“Mister?” my driver said. “We’re here.” She turned to look at me curiously. “We’ve been here for almost three minutes. Little early for shopping, though. Are you sure this is where you want to be?”</p><p class="calibre13">I only knew this was where I <span class="italic">had</span> to be. I paid what was on the meter, added a generous tip (it was the FBI’s money, after all), wished her a nice day, and got out.</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">4</span></span></p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre21">Lisbon Falls was as stinky as ever, but at least the power was on; the blinker at the intersection was flashing as it swung in the northwest wind. The Kennebec Fruit was dark, the front window still empty of the apples, oranges, and bananas that would be displayed there later on. The sign hanging in the door of the greenfront read WILL OPEN AT 10 A.M. A few cars moved on Main Street and a few pedestrians scuttled along with their collars turned up. Across the street, however, the Worumbo mill was fully operational. I could hear the <span class="italic">shat-HOOSH, shat-HOOSH</span> of the weaving flats even from where I was standing. Then I heard something else: someone was calling me, although not by either of my names.</p><p class="calibre13">“Jimla! Hey, Jimla!”</p><p class="calibre13">I turned toward the mill, thinking: <span class="italic">He’s back. The Yellow Card Man is back from the dead, just like President Kennedy.</span></p><p class="calibre13">Only it wasn’t the Yellow Card Man any more than the taxi driver who’d picked me up at the bus station was the same one who’d taken me from Lisbon Falls to the Tamarack Motor Court in 1958. Except the two drivers were <span class="italic">almost</span> the same, because the past harmonizes, and the man across the street was similar to the one who’d asked me for a buck because it was double-money day at the greenfront. He was a lot younger than the Yellow Card Man, and his black overcoat was newer and cleaner . . . but it was <span class="italic">almost</span> the same coat.</p><p class="calibre13">“Jimla! Over here!” He beckoned. The wind flapped the hem of the overcoat; it made the sign to his left swing on its chain the way the blinker was swinging on its wire. I could still read it, though: <span class="bold">NO ADMITTANCE BEYOND THIS POINT UNTIL SEWER PIPE IS REPAIRED</span>.</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="italic">Five years,</span> I thought, <span class="italic">and that pesky sewer pipe’s still busted.</span></p><p class="calibre13">“Jimla! Don’t make me come over there and get you!”</p><p class="calibre13">He probably could; his suicidal predecessor had been able to make it all the way to the greenfront. But I felt sure that if I went limping down the Old Lewiston Road fast enough, this new version would be out of luck. He might be able to follow me to the Red &amp; White Supermarket, where Al had bought his meat, but if I made it as far as Titus Chevron, or the Jolly White Elephant, I could turn around and thumb my nose at him. He was stuck near the rabbit-hole. If he hadn’t been, I would have seen him in Dallas. I knew it as surely as I knew that gravity keeps folks from floating into outer space.</p><p class="calibre13">As if to confirm this, he called, “Jimla, <span class="italic">please</span>!” The desperation I saw in his face was like the wind: thin but somehow relentless.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">I looked both ways for traffic, saw none, and crossed the street to where he stood. As I approached, I saw two other differences. Like his predecessor, he was wearing a fedora, but it was clean instead of filthy. And as with his predecessor, a colored card was poking up from the hatband like an old-fashioned reporter’s press pass. Only this one wasn’t yellow, or orange, or black.</p><p class="calibre13">It was green.</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">5</span></span></p><p class="calibre21">“Thank God,” he said. He took one of my hands in both of his and squeezed it. The flesh of his palms was almost as cold as the air. I pulled back from him, but gently. I sensed no danger about him, only that thin and insistent desperation. Although that in itself might be dangerous; it might be as keen as the blade of the knife John Clayton had used on Sadie’s face.</p><p class="calibre13">“Who are you?” I asked. “And why do you call me Jimla? Jim LaDue is a long way from here, mister.”</p><p class="calibre13">“I don’t know who Jim LaDue is,” the Green Card Man said. “I’ve stayed away from your string as much as—”</p><p class="calibre13">He stopped. His face contorted. The sides of his hands rose to his temples and pressed there, as if to hold his brains in. But it was the card stuck in the band of his hat that captured most of my attention. The color wasn’t entirely fixed. For a moment it swirled and swam, reminding me of the screensaver that takes over my computer after it’s been idle for fifteen minutes or so. The green swirled into a pale canary yellow. Then, as he slowly lowered his hands, it returned to green. But maybe not as bright a green as when I’d first noticed it.</p><p class="calibre13">“I’ve stayed away from your string as much as possible,” the man in the black overcoat said, “but it hasn’t been <span class="italic">entirely</span> possible. Besides, there are so <span class="italic">many</span> strings now. Thanks to you and your friend the cook, there’s so much <span class="italic">crap.</span>”</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">“I don’t understand any of this,” I said, but that wasn’t quite true. I could at least figure out the card this man (and his wet-brain forerunner) carried. They were like the badges worn by people who worked in nuclear power plants. Only instead of measuring radiation, the cards monitored . . . what? Sanity? Green, your bag of marbles was full. Yellow, you’d started to lose them. Orange, call for the men in the white coats. And when your card turned black . . .</p><p class="calibre13">The Green Card Man was watching me carefully. From across the street he’d looked no older than thirty. Over here, he looked closer to forty-five. Only, when you got close enough to look into his eyes, he looked older than the ages and not right in the head.</p><p class="calibre13">“Are you some kind of guardian? Do you guard the rabbit-hole?”</p><p class="calibre13">He smiled . . . or tried to. “That’s what your friend called it.” From his pocket he took a pack of cigarettes. There was no label on them. That was something I’d never seen before, either here in the Land of Ago or in the Land of Ahead.</p><p class="calibre13">“Is this the only one?”</p><p class="calibre13">He produced a lighter, cupped it to keep the wind from blowing the flame out, then set fire to the end of his cigarette. The smell was sweet, more like marijuana than tobacco. But it wasn’t marijuana. Although he never said, I believe it was something medicinal. Perhaps not so different from my Goody’s Headache Powder.</p><p class="calibre13">“There are a few. Think of a glass of ginger ale that’s been left out and forgotten.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Okay . . .”</p><p class="calibre13">“After two or three days, almost all the carbonation is gone, but there are still a few bubbles left. What you call the rabbit-hole isn’t a hole at all. It’s a bubble. As far as guarding . . . no. Not really. It would be nice, but there’s very little we could do that wouldn’t make things worse. That’s the trouble with traveling in time, Jimla.”</p><p class="calibre13">“My name is Jake.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Fine. What we do, Jake, is watch. Sometimes we warn. As Kyle tried to warn your friend the cook.”</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">So the crazy guy had a name. A perfectly normal one. Kyle, for God’s sake. It made things worse because it made them more real.</p><p class="calibre13">“He <span class="italic">never</span> tried to warn Al! All he ever did was ask for a buck to buy cheap wine with!”</p><p class="calibre13">The Green Card Man dragged on his cigarette and looked down at the cracked concrete, frowning as if something were written there. <span class="italic">Shat-HOOSH, shat-HOOSH</span> said the weaving flats. “He did at first,” he said. “In his way. Your friend was too excited by the new world he’d found to pay attention. And by then Kyle was already tottering. It’s a . . . how would you put it? An occupational hazard. What we do puts us under enormous mental strain. Do you know why?”</p><p class="calibre13">I shook my head.</p><p class="calibre13">“Think a minute. How many little explorations and shopping trips did your cook friend make even <span class="italic">before</span> he got the idea of going to Dallas to stop Oswald? Fifty? A hundred? Two hundred?”</p><p class="calibre13">I tried to remember how long Al’s Diner had stood in the mill courtyard and couldn’t. “Probably even more than that.”</p><p class="calibre13">“And what did he tell you? Each trip was the first time?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Yes. A complete reset.”</p><p class="calibre13">He laughed wearily. “Sure he did. People believe what they see. And still, he should have known better. <span class="italic">You</span> should have known better. Each trip creates its own string, and when you have enough strings, they always get snarled. Did it ever cross your friend’s mind to wonder how he could buy the same meat over and over? Or why things he brought from 1958 never disappeared when he made the next trip?”</p><p class="calibre13">“I asked him about that. He didn’t know, so he dismissed it.”</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">He started to smile, but it turned into a wince. The green once more started to fade out of the card stuck in his hat. He dragged deep on his sweet-smelling cigarette. The color returned and steadied. “Yeah, ignoring the obvious. It’s what we all do. Even after his sanity began to totter, Kyle undoubtedly knew that his trips to yonder liquor store were making his condition worse, but he went on, regardless. I don’t blame him; I’m sure the wine eased his pain. Especially toward the end. Things might have been better if he hadn’t been able to get to the liquor store—if it was outside the circle—but it wasn’t. And really, who can say? There is no blaming here, Jake. No condemnation.”</p><p class="calibre13">That was good to hear, but only because it meant we could converse about this lunatic subject like halfway rational men. Not that his feelings mattered much to me, either way; I still had to do what I had to do. “What’s your name?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Zack Lang. From Seattle, originally.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Seattle <span class="italic">when</span>?”</p><p class="calibre13">“It’s a question with no relevance to the current discussion.”</p><p class="calibre13">“It hurts you to be here, doesn’t it?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Yes. My own sanity won’t last much longer, if I don’t get back. And the residual effects will be with me forever. High suicide rate among our kind, Jake. Very high. Men—and we <span class="italic">are</span> men, not aliens or supernatural beings, if that’s what you were thinking—aren’t made to hold multiple reality-strings in their heads. It’s not like using your imagination. It’s not like that at all. We have training, of course, but you can still feel it eating into you. Like acid.”</p><p class="calibre13">“So every trip <span class="italic">isn’t</span> a complete reset.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Yes and no. It leaves <span class="italic">residue.</span> Every time your cook friend—”</p><p class="calibre13">“His name was Al.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Yes, I suppose I knew that, but my memory has started to break down. It’s like Alzheimer’s, only it’s <span class="italic">not</span> Alzheimer’s. It’s because the brain can’t help trying to reconcile all those thin overlays of reality. The strings create multiple images of the future. Some are clear, most are hazy. That’s probably why Kyle thought your name was Jimla. He must have heard it along one of the strings.”</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="italic">He didn’t hear it,</span> I thought. <span class="italic">He saw it on some kind of String-O-Vision. On a billboard in Texas. Maybe even through my eyes.</span></p><p class="calibre13">“You don’t know how lucky you are, Jake. For you, time-travel is simple.”</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="italic">Not all</span> that <span class="italic">simple,</span> I thought.</p><p class="calibre13">“There <span class="italic">were</span> paradoxes,” I said. “All kinds of them. Weren’t there?”</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">“No, that’s the wrong word. It’s <span class="italic">residue.</span> Didn’t I just tell you that?” He honestly didn’t seem sure. “It gums up the machine. Eventually a point will come where the machine simply . . . stops.”</p><p class="calibre13">I thought of how the engine had blown in the Studebaker Sadie and I had stolen.</p><p class="calibre13">“Buying meat over and over again in 1958 wasn’t so bad,” Zack Lang said. “Oh, it was causing trouble down the line, but it was bearable. Then the <span class="italic">big</span> changes started. Saving Kennedy was the biggest of all.”</p><p class="calibre13">I tried to speak and couldn’t.</p><p class="calibre13">“Are you beginning to understand?”</p><p class="calibre13">Not entirely, but I could see the general outline, and it scared the living hell out of me. The future was on strings. Like a puppet. Good God.</p><p class="calibre13">“The earthquake . . . I <span class="italic">did</span> cause it. When I saved Kennedy, I . . . what? Ripped the time-space continuum?” That should have come out sounding stupid, but it didn’t. It sounded very grave. My head began to throb.</p><p class="calibre13">“You need to go back now, Jake.” He spoke gently. “You need to go back and see exactly what you’ve done. What all your hard and no doubt well-meaning work has accomplished.”</p><p class="calibre13">I said nothing. I had been worried about going back, but now I was afraid, as well. Is there any phrase more ominous than <span class="italic">you need to see exactly what you’ve done</span>? I couldn’t think of one offhand.</p><p class="calibre13">“Go. Have a look. Spend a little time. But only a little. If this isn’t put right soon, there’s going to be a catastrophe.”</p><p class="calibre13">“How big?”</p><p class="calibre13">He spoke calmly. “It could destroy everything.”</p><p class="calibre13">“The world? The solar system?” I had to put my hand on the side of the drying shed to hold myself up. “The galaxy? The universe?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Bigger than that.” He paused, wanting to make sure I understood. The card in his hatband swirled, turned yellow, swirled back toward green. “Reality itself.”</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">6</span></span></p><p class="calibre21">I walked to the chain. The sign reading <span class="bold">NO ADMITTANCE BEYOND THIS POINT UNTIL SEWER PIPE IS REPAIRED</span> squeaked in the wind. I looked back at Zack Lang, that traveler from who knew when. He looked at me without expression, the hem of his black overcoat flapping around his shins.</p><p class="calibre13">“Lang! The harmonies . . . I caused them all. Didn’t I?”</p><p class="calibre13">He might have nodded. I’m not sure.</p><p class="calibre13">The past fought change because it was destructive to the future. Change created—</p><p class="calibre13">I thought of an old ad for Memorex audiotape. It showed a crystal glass being shattered by sound vibrations. By pure harmonics.</p><p class="calibre13">“And with every change I succeeded in making, those harmonies increased. <span class="italic">That’s</span> the real danger, isn’t it? Those fucking harmonies.”</p><p class="calibre13">No answer. Perhaps he had known and forgotten; perhaps he had never known at all.</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="italic">Easy,</span> I told myself . . . as I had five years before, when the first strands of gray had yet to show up in my hair. <span class="italic">Just take it easy.</span></p><p class="calibre13">I ducked under the chain, my left knee yipping, then stood for a second with the high green side of the drying shed on my left. This time there was no chunk of concrete to mark the spot where the invisible stairs began. How far away from the chain had they been? I couldn’t remember.</p><p class="calibre13">I walked slowly, slowly, my shoes gritting on the cracked concrete. <span class="italic">Shat-HOOSH, shat-HOOSH,</span> said the weaving flats . . . and then, as I took my sixth step, and the seventh, the sound changed to <span class="italic">too-FAR, too-FAR.</span> I took another step. Then another. Soon I’d reach the end of the drying shed and be in the courtyard beyond. It was gone. The bubble had burst.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">I took one more step, and although there was no stair riser, for just a moment I saw my shoe as a double exposure. It was on the concrete, but it was also on dirty green linoleum. I took another step, and <span class="italic">I</span> was a double exposure. Most of my body was standing beside the Worumbo mill drying shed in late November of 1963, but part of me was somewhere else, and it wasn’t the pantry of Al’s Diner.</p><p class="calibre13">What if I came out not in Maine, not even on earth, but in some strange other dimension? Some place with a crazy red sky and air that would poison my lungs and stop my heart?</p><p class="calibre13">I looked back again. Lang stood there with his coat whipping in the wind. There was still no expression on his face. <span class="italic">You’re on your own,</span> that empty face seemed to say. <span class="italic">I can’t make you do anything.</span></p><p class="calibre13">It was true, but unless I went through the rabbit-hole into the Land of Ahead, I wouldn’t be able to come back to the Land of Ago. And Sadie would stay dead forever.</p><p class="calibre13">I closed my eyes and managed one more step. Suddenly I could smell faint ammonia and some other, more unpleasant, odor. After you’d crossed the country at the rear of a lot of Greyhound buses, that second smell was unmistakable. It was the unlovely aroma of a toilet cubicle that needed a lot more than a Glade air-freshener on the wall to sweeten it up.</p><p class="calibre13">Eyes closed, I took one more step, and heard that weird popping sound inside my head. I opened my eyes. I was in a small, filthy bathroom. There was no toilet; it had been removed, leaving nothing but the dirty shadow of its footing. An ancient urine-cake, faded from its bright blue operating color to a listless gray, lay in the corner. Ants marched back and forth over it. The corner I’d come out in was blocked off by cartons filled with empty bottles and cans. It reminded me of Lee’s shooter’s nest.</p><p class="calibre13">I pushed a couple of the boxes aside and eased my way into the little room. I started for the door, then restacked the cartons. No sense making it easy for anyone to stumble down the rabbit-hole by mistake. Then I stepped outside and back into 2011.</p><p class="calibre17"><span class="calibre16"><span class="bold">7</span></span></p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre21">It had been dark the last time I’d gone down the rabbit-hole, so of course it was dark now, because it was only two minutes later. A lot had changed in those two minutes, though. I could see that even in the gloom. At some point in the last forty-eight years, the mill had burned down. All that remained were a few blackened walls, a fallen stack (that reminded me, inevitably, of the one I’d seen at the site of the Kitchener Ironworks in Derry), and several piles of rubble. There was no sign of Your Maine Snuggery, L.L. Bean Express, or any other upscale shops. Here was a wrecked mill standing on the banks of the Androscoggin. Nothing else.</p><p class="calibre13">On the June night when I’d left on my five-year mission to save Kennedy, the temperature had been pleasantly mild. Now it was beastly hot. I took off the sheepskin-lined coat I’d bought in Auburn and tossed it into the ill-smelling bathroom. When I closed the door again, I saw the sign on it: <span class="bold">BATHROOM OUT OF ORDER! NO TOILET!!! SEWER PIPE IS BROKEN!!!</span></p><p class="calibre13">Beautiful young presidents died and beautiful young presidents lived, beautiful young women lived and then they died, but the broken sewer pipe beneath the courtyard of the old Worumbo mill was apparently eternal.</p><p class="calibre13">The chain was still there, too. I walked to it along the flank of the dirty old cinderblock building that had replaced the drying shed. When I ducked under the chain and went around to the front of the building, I saw it was an abandoned convenience store called Quik-Flash. The windows were shattered and all the shelves had been taken away. The place was nothing but a shell where one emergency light, its battery almost dead, buzzed like a dying fly against a winter windowpane. There was graffiti spray-painted on the remains of the floor, and just enough light to read it: GET OUT OF TOWN YOU PAKI BASTARD.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">I walked across the broken concrete of the courtyard. The lot where the millworkers had once parked was gone. Nothing had been built there; it was just a vacant rectangle filled with smashed bottles, jigsaw chunks of old asphalt, and listless clumps of trash grass. Used condoms hung from some of these like ancient party-streamers. I looked up for stars and saw none. The sky was covered with low-hanging clouds just thin enough to allow a little vague moonlight to seep through. The blinker at the intersection of Main Street and Route 196 (once known as the Old Lewiston Road) had been replaced at some point by a traffic light, but it was dark. That was all right; there was no traffic in either direction.</p><p class="calibre13">The Fruit was gone. There was a cellar-hole where it had stood. Across from it, where the greenfront had been in 1958 and where a bank should have been standing in 2011, was something called Province of Maine Food Cooperative. Except these windows were also broken, and any goods that might have been inside were long gone. The place was as gutted as the Quik-Flash.</p><p class="calibre13">Halfway across the deserted intersection, I was frozen in place by a great watery ripping sound. The only thing I could imagine making a noise like that was some kind of exotic ice-plane, melting even as it broke the sound barrier. The ground beneath my feet briefly trembled. A car alarm blurped, then quit. Dogs barked, then fell silent, one by one.</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="italic">Earthquake in Los Angle-ees,</span> I thought. <span class="italic">Seven thousand dead.</span></p><p class="calibre13">Headlights splashed down Route 196, and I made it to the far sidewalk in a hurry. The vehicle turned out to be a little square bus with ROUNDABOUT in its lighted destination window. That rang a faint bell, but I don’t know why. Some harmony or other, I suppose. On the roof of the bus were several revolving gadgets that looked like heat-ventilators. Wind turbines, maybe? Was that possible? There was no combustion engine sound, only a faint electrical hum. I watched until the wide crescent of its single taillight was out of sight.</p><p class="calibre13">Okay, so gas engines were being phased out in this version of the future—this <span class="italic">string,</span> to use Zack Lang’s term. That was a good thing, wasn’t it?</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">Possibly, but the air had a heavy, somehow dead feel as I pulled it into my lungs, and there was a kind of olfactory afterscent that reminded me of how my Lionel train transformer smelled when, as a kid, I pushed it too hard. <span class="italic">Time to turn it off and let it rest awhile,</span> my father would say.</p><p class="calibre13">There were a few businesses on Main Street that looked like half-going concerns, but mostly it was a shambles. The sidewalk was cracked and littered with rubbish. I saw half a dozen parked cars, and every one was either a gas-electric hybrid or equipped with the roof-spinner devices. One of them was a Honda Zephyr; one was a Takuro Spirit; another a Ford Breeze. They looked old, and a couple had been vandalized. All had pink stickers on the windshields, the black letters big enough to read even in the gloom: <span class="italic">PROVINCE OF MAINE “A” STICKER ALWAYS PRODUCE RATION BOOK</span>.</p><p class="calibre13">A gang of kids was idling up the other side of the street, laughing and talking. “Hey!” I called across to them. “Is the library still open?”</p><p class="calibre13">They looked over. I saw the firefly wink of cigarettes . . . except the smell that drifted across to me was almost surely pot. “Fuck off, man!” one of them shouted back.</p><p class="calibre13">Another turned, dropped his pants, and mooned me. “You find any books up there, they’re all yours!”</p><p class="calibre13">There was general laughter and they walked on, talking in lower voices and looking back.</p><p class="calibre13">I didn’t mind being mooned—it wasn’t the first time—but I didn’t like those looks, and I liked the low voices even less. There might be something conspiratorial there. Jake Epping didn’t exactly believe that, but George Amberson did; George had been through a lot, and it was George who bent down, grabbed two fist-sized chunks of concrete, and stuffed them into his front pockets, just for good luck. Jake thought he was being silly but didn’t object.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">A block farther up, the business district (such as it was) came to an abrupt end. I saw an elderly woman hurrying along and glancing nervously at the boys, who were now a little farther up on the other side of Main. She was wearing a kerchief and what looked like a respirator—the kind of thing people with COPD or advanced emphysema use.</p><p class="calibre13">“Ma’am, do you know if the library—”</p><p class="calibre13">“Leave me alone!” Her eyes were large and scared. The moon shone briefly through a rift in the clouds, and I saw that her face was covered with sores. The one below her right eye appeared to have eaten right down to the bone. “I have a paper that says I can be out, it’s got a Council stamp, so leave me alone! I’m going to see my sister! Those boys are bad enough, and soon they’ll start their wilding. If you touch me, I’ll buzz my beezer and a constable will come!”</p><p class="calibre13">I somehow doubted that.</p><p class="calibre13">“Ma’am, I just want to know if the library is still—”</p><p class="calibre13">“It’s been closed for years and all the books are gone! They have Hate Meetings there now. Leave me alone, I say, or I’ll buzz for a constable!”</p><p class="calibre13">She scuttled away, looking back over her shoulder every few seconds to make sure I wasn’t coming after her. I let her put enough distance between us to make her feel comfy, then continued up Main Street. My knee was recovering a bit from my stair-climbing exertions in the Book Depository, but I was still limping, and would be for some time to come. Lights burned behind drawn curtains in a few houses, but I was pretty sure it wasn’t produced by Central Maine Power. Those were Coleman lanterns and in some cases kerosene lamps. Most of the houses were dark. Some were charred wrecks. There was a Nazi swastika on one of the wrecks and the words JEW RAT spray-painted on another.</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="italic">Those boys are bad enough and soon they’ll start their wilding.</span></p><p class="calibre13">And . . . had she really said Hate Meetings?</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">In front of one of the few houses that looked in good shape—it was a mansion compared to most of them—I saw a long hitching rail, like in a western movie. And actual horses had been tied up there. When the sky lightened in another of those diffuse spasms, I could see horsepucky pats, some of them fresh. The driveway was gated. The moon had gone in again, so I couldn’t read the sign on the iron slats, but I didn’t need to read it to know it said KEEP OUT.</p><p class="calibre13">Now, from up ahead, I heard someone enunciate a single word: “Cunt!”</p><p class="calibre13">It didn’t sound young, like one of the wild boys, and it was coming from my side of the street rather than theirs. The guy sounded pissed off. He also sounded like he might be talking to himself. I walked toward his voice.</p><p class="calibre13">“Mother-<span class="italic">fucker</span>!” the voice cried, exasperated. “<span class="italic">Shit</span>-ass!”</p><p class="calibre13">He was maybe a block up. Before I got there, I heard a loud metallic bonk and the male voice cried: “Get on with you! Goddam little wetnosed sonsabitches! Get on with you before I pull my pistol!”</p><p class="calibre13">Mocking laughter greeted this. It was the pot-smoking wild boys, and the voice that replied certainly belonged to the one who had mooned me. “Only pistol you got is the one in your pants, and I bet it’s got a mighty limp barrel!”</p><p class="calibre13">More laughter. It was followed by a high metallic <span class="italic">spannng</span> sound.</p><p class="calibre13">“You fucks, you broke one of my spokes!” When the man yelled at them again, his voice was tinged with reluctant fear. “Nah, nah, stay on your own goddam side!”</p><p class="calibre13">The clouds rifted. The moon peeked through. By its chancy light I saw an old man in a wheelchair. He was halfway across one of the streets intersecting Main—Goddard, if the name hadn’t changed. One of his wheels had gotten stuck in a pothole, causing the chair to cant drunkenly to the left. The boys were crossing toward him. The kid who had told me to fuck off was holding a slingshot with a good-sized rock in it. That explained the bonk and the spang.</p><p class="calibre13">“Got any oldbucks, grampy? For that matter, you got any newbucks or canned goods?”</p><p class="calibre13">“No! If you don’t have the goddam decency to push me out of the hole I’m in, at least go away and leave me alone!”</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">But they were wilding, and they weren’t going to do that. They were going to rob him of whatever small shit he might happen to have, maybe beat him up, tip him over for sure.</p><p class="calibre13">Jake and George came together, and both of them saw red.</p><p class="calibre13">The attention of the wild boys was fixed on the wheelchair-geezer and they didn’t see me cutting toward them on a diagonal—just as I’d cut across the sixth floor of the School Book Depository. My left arm still wasn’t much good, but my right was fine, toned up by three months of physical therapy, first in Parkland and then at Eden Fallows. And I still had some of the accuracy that had made me a varsity third baseman in high school. I pegged the first chunk of concrete from thirty feet away and caught Moon Man in the center of the chest. He screamed with pain and surprise. All the boys—there were five of them—turned toward me. When they did, I saw that their faces were as disfigured as the frightened woman’s had been. The one with the slingshot, young Master Fuck Off, was the worst. There was nothing but a hole where his nose should have been.</p><p class="calibre13">I transferred my second chunk of concrete from my left hand to my right, and threw it at the tallest of the boys, who was wearing a huge pair of loose pants with the waistband drawn up nearly to his sternum. He raised a blocking arm. The concrete struck it, knocking the joint he was holding into the street. He took one look at my face, then wheeled and ran. Moon Man followed him. That left three.</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="italic">“Walk it to em, son!”</span> the old man in the wheelchair shrilled. <span class="italic">“They got it coming, by Christ!”</span></p><p class="calibre13">I was sure they did, but they had me outnumbered and my ammo was gone. When you’re dealing with teenagers, the only possible way to win in such a situation is to show no fear, only genuine adult outrage. You just keep coming, and that was what I did. I seized young Master Fuck Off by the front of his ragged tee-shirt with my right hand and snatched the slingshot away from him with the left. He stared at me, wide-eyed, and put up no resistance.</p><a class="calibre8"></a><p class="calibre13">“You chickenshit,” I said, getting my face right up into his . . . and never mind the nose that wasn’t. He smelled sweaty and pot-smoky and deeply dirty. “How chickenshit do you have to be to go after an old man in a wheelchair?”</p><p class="calibre13">“Who are y—”</p><p class="calibre13">“Charlie Fucking Chaplin. I went to France just to see the ladies dance. Now get out of here.”</p><p class="calibre13">“Give me back my—”</p><p class="calibre13">I knew what he wanted and bonked the center of his forehead with it. It started one of his sores trickling and must have hurt like hell, because his eyes filled with tears. This disgusted me and filled me with pity, but I tried to show neither. “You get nothing, chickenshit, except a chance to get out of here before I rip your worthless balls off your no doubt diseased scrote and stuff them into the hole where your nose used to be. One chance. Take it.” I drew in breath, then screamed it out at his face in a spray of noise and spit: <span class="italic">“Run!”</span></p><p class="calibre13">I watched them go, feeling shame and exultation in roughly equal parts. The old Jake had been great at quelling rowdy study halls on Friday afternoons before vacations, but that was about as far as his skills went. The new Jake, however, was part George. And George had been through a lot.</p><p class="calibre13">From behind me came a heavy bout of coughing. It made me think of Al Templeton. When it stopped, the old man said, “Fella, I would have pissed five years’ worth of kidney rocks just to see those vile dinks take to their heels like that. I don’t know who you are, but I’ve got a little Glenfiddich left in my pantry—the real stuff—and if you push me out of this goddam hole in the road and roll me home, I’ll share it with you.”</p><p class="calibre13">The moon had gone in again, but as it came back out through the ragged clouds, I saw his face. He was wearing a long white beard and had a cannula stuffed up his nose, but even after five years, I had no trouble at all recognizing the man who had gotten me into this mess.</p><p class="calibre13">“Hello, Harry,” I said.</p><div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_47"></div></body>
