<p class="dl"><em class="calibre5">October 26th</em></p>
<p class="calibre7">I don’t trust him. He’s bought this house. If he lets me go he’ll have to trust me. Or he’ll have to sell it and disappear before I can (could) get to the police. Either way it would be unlike him.</p>
<p class="calibre7">It’s too depressing, I <em class="calibre5">have</em> to believe he’ll keep his word.</p>
<p class="calibre7">He spends pounds and pounds on me. It must be nearly two hundred already. Any book, any record, any clothes. He has all my sizes. I sketch what I want, I mix up the colours as a guide. He even buys all my underwear. I can’t put on the black and peach creations he bought before, so I told him to go and get something sensible at Marks and Spencer. He said, can I buy a lot together? Of course it must be agony for him to go shopping for me (what does he do at the chemist’s?), so I suppose he prefers to get it all over in one go. But what can they think of him? One dozen pants and three slips and vests and bras. I asked him what they said when he gave the order and he went red. I think they think I’m a bit peculiar, he said. It was the first time I’ve really laughed since I came here.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Every time he buys me something I think it is proof that he’s not going to kill me or do anything else unpleasant.</p>
<p class="calibre7">I shouldn’t, but I like it when he comes in at lunch-time from wherever he goes. There are always parcels. It’s like having a perpetual Christmas Day and not even having to thank Santa Claus. Sometimes he brings things I haven’t asked for. He always brings flowers, and that is nice. Chocolates, but he eats more of them than I do. And he keeps on asking me what I’d like him to buy.</p>
<p class="calibre7">I know he’s the Devil showing me the world that can be mine. So I don’t sell myself to him. I cost him a lot in little things, but I know he wants me to ask for something big. He’s dying to make me grateful. But he shan’t.</p>
<p class="calibre7">An awful thought that came to me today: they will have suspected G.P. Caroline is bound to give the police his name. Poor man. He will be sarcastic and they won’t like it.</p>
<p class="calibre7">I’ve been trying to draw him today. Strange. It is hopeless. Nothing like him.</p>
<p class="calibre7">I know he is short, only an inch or two more than me. (I’ve always dreamed tall men. Silly.)</p>
<p class="calibre7">He is going bald and he has a nose like a Jew’s, though he isn’t (not that I’d mind if he was). And the face is too broad. Battered, worn; battered and worn and pitted into a bit of a mask, so that I never quite believe whatever expression it’s got on. I glimpse things I think must come from behind; but I’m never very sure. He puts on a special dry face for me sometimes. I see it go on. It doesn’t seem dishonest, though, it seems just G.P. Life is a bit of a joke, it’s silly to take it seriously. Be serious about art, but joke a little about everything else. Not the day when the H-bombs drop, but the “day of the great fry-up.” “When the great fry-up takes place.” Sick, sick. It’s his way of being healthy.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Short and broad and broad-faced with a hook-nose; even a bit Turkish. Not really English-looking at all.</p>
<p class="calibre7">I have this silly notion about English good looks. Advertisement men.</p>
