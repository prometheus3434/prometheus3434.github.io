<p class="dl"><em class="calibre5">October 31st</em></p>
<p class="calibre7">Nothing. I psycho-analyzed him this evening.</p>
<p class="calibre7">He would sit so stiffly beside me.</p>
<p class="calibre7">We were looking at Goya’s etchings. Perhaps it was the etchings themselves, but he sat and I thought he wasn’t really looking at them. But thinking only of being so close to me.</p>
<p class="calibre7">His inhibition. It’s absurd. I talked at him as if he could easily be normal. As if he wasn’t a maniac keeping me prisoner here. But a nice young man who wanted a bit of chivvying from a jolly girl-friend.</p>
<p class="calibre7">It’s because I never see anyone else. He becomes the norm. I forget to compare.</p>
<p class="space-break">Another time G.P. It was soon after the icy douche (what he said about my work). I was restless one evening. I went round to his flat. About ten. He had his dressing-gown on.</p>
<p class="calibre7">I was just going to bed, he said.</p>
<p class="calibre7">I wanted to hear some music, I said. I’ll go away. But I didn’t.</p>
<p class="calibre7">He said, it’s late.</p>
<p class="calibre7">I said I was depressed. It had been a beastly day and Caroline had been so silly at supper.</p>
<p class="calibre7">He let me go up and made me sit on the divan and he put on some music and turned out the lights and the moon came through the window. It fell on my legs and lap through the skylight, a lovely slow silver moon. Sailing. And he sat in the armchair on the other side of the room, in the shadows.</p>
<p class="calibre7">It was the music.</p>
<p class="calibre7">The <em class="calibre5">Goldberg Variations</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre7">There was one towards the end that was very slow, very simple, <em class="calibre5">very</em> sad, but so beautiful beyond words or drawing or anything but music, beautiful there in the moonlight. Moon-music, so silvery, so far, so noble.</p>
<p class="calibre7">The two of us in that room. No past, no future. All intense deep that-time-only. A feeling that everything must end, the music, ourselves, the moon, everything. That if you get to the heart of things you find sadness for ever and ever, everywhere; but a beautiful silver sadness, like a Christ face.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Accepting the sadness. Knowing that to pretend it was all gay was treachery. Treachery to everyone sad at that moment, everyone ever sad, treachery to such music, such truth.</p>
<p class="calibre7">In all the fuss and anxiety and the shoddiness and the business of London, making a career, getting pashes, art, learning, grabbing frantically at experience, suddenly this silent silver room full of that music.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Like lying on one’s back as we did in Spain when we slept out looking up between the fig-branches into the star-corridors, the great seas and oceans of stars. Knowing what it was to be <em class="calibre5">in</em> a universe.</p>
<p class="calibre7">I cried. In silence.</p>
<p class="calibre7">At the end he said, now can I go to bed? Gently, making fun of me a little bit, bringing me back to earth. And I went. I don’t think we said anything. I can’t remember. He had his little dry smile, he could see I was moved.</p>
<p class="calibre7">His perfect tact.</p>
<p class="calibre7">I would have gone to bed with him that night. If he had asked. If he had come and kissed me.</p>
<p class="newpage" id="calibre_pb_0">Not for his sake, but for being alive’s.</p>
