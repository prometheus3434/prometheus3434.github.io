<p class="dl"><em class="calibre5">December 5th</em></p>
<p class="calibre7">G.P.</p>
<p class="calibre7">The Rape of Intelligence. By the moneyed masses, the New People.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Things he says. They shock you, but you remember them. They stick. Hard, meant to last.</p>
<p class="calibre7">I’ve been doing skyscapes all day. I just draw a line an inch from the bottom. That’s the earth. Then I think of nothing but the sky. June sky, December, August, spring-rain, thunder, dawn, dusk. I’ve done dozens of skies. Pure sky, nothing else. Just the simple line and the skies above.</p>
<p class="calibre7">A strange thought: I would not want this not to have happened. Because if I escape I shall be a completely different and I think better person. Because if I don’t escape, if something dreadful happened, I shall still know that the person I was and would have stayed if this hadn’t happened was not the person I now want to be.</p>
<p class="calibre7">It’s like firing a pot. You have to risk the cracking and the warping.</p>
<p class="space-break">Caliban’s very quiet. A sort of truce.</p>
<p class="calibre7">I’m going to ask to go up tomorrow. I want to see if he’s actually doing anything.</p>
<p class="space-break-new" id="calibre_pb_26">Today I asked him to bind me and gag me and let me sit at the foot of the cellar steps with the door out open. In the end he agreed. So I could look up and see the sky. A pale grey sky. I saw birds fly across, pigeons, I think. I heard outside sounds. This is the first proper daylight I’ve seen for two months. It lived. It made me cry.</p>
