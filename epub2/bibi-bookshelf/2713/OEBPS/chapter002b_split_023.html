<p class="dl"><em class="calibre5">December 2nd</em></p>
<p class="calibre7">I’m to go upstairs. He’s going to convert a room. He said it would take a week. I said, all right, but if it’s another put-off…</p>
<p class="calibre7">We’ll see.</p>
<p class="space-break">I lay in bed last night and thought of G.P. I thought of being in bed with him. I wanted to be in bed with him. I wanted the marvellous, the fantastic ordinariness of him.</p>
<p class="calibre7">His promiscuity is creative. Vital. Even though it hurts. He creates love and life and excitement around him; he lives, the people he loves remember him.</p>
<p class="calibre7">I’ve always felt like it sometimes. Promiscuous. Anyone I see, even just some boy in the Tube, some man, I think what would he be like in bed. I look at the mouths and their hands, put on a prim expression and think about them having me in bed.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Even Toinette, getting into bed with anyone. I used to think it was messy. But love is beautiful, any love. Even just sex. The only thing that is ugly is this frozen lifeless utter lack-love between Caliban and me.</p>
<p class="space-break">This morning I was imagining I’d escaped and that Caliban was in court. I was speaking for him. I said his case was tragic, he needed sympathy and psychiatry. Forgiveness.</p>
<p class="calibre7">I wasn’t being noble. I despise him too much to hate him.</p>
<p class="calibre7">It’s funny. I probably should speak for him.</p>
<p class="calibre7">I knew we shouldn’t be able to meet again.</p>
<p class="newpage" id="calibre_pb_23">I could never cure him. Because I’m his disease.</p>
