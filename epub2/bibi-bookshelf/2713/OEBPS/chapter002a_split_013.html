<p class="calibre7">The tunnel round the door is my best bet. I feel I <em class="calibre5">must</em> try it soon. I think I’ve worked out a way of getting him away. I’ve been looking very carefully at the door this afternoon. It’s wood faced with iron on this side. Terribly solid. I could never break it down or lever it open. He’s made sure there’s nothing to break and lever with, in any case.</p>
<p class="calibre7">I’ve begun to collect some “tools.” A tumbler I can break. That will be something sharp. A fork and two teaspoons. They’re aluminium, but they might be useful. What I need most is something strong and sharp to pick out the cement between the stones with. Once I can make a hole through them it shouldn’t be too difficult to get round into the outer cellar.</p>
<p class="calibre7">This makes me feel practical. Businesslike. But I haven’t done anything.</p>
<p class="newpage" id="calibre_pb_13">I feel more hopeful. I don’t know why. But I do.</p>
