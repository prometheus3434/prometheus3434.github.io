<p class="dl"><em class="calibre5">November 26th</em></p>
<p class="calibre7">The only unusual thing about him—how he loves me. Ordinary New People couldn’t love anything as he loves me. That is blindly. Absolutely. Like Dante and Beatrice.</p>
<p class="calibre7">He enjoys being hopelessly in love with me. I expect Dante was the same. Mooning around knowing it was all quite hopeless and getting lots of good creative material from the experience.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Though of course Caliban can’t get anything but his own miserable pleasure.</p>
<p class="calibre7">People who don’t <em class="calibre5">make</em> anything. I hate them.</p>
<p class="space-break">How frightened of dying I was in those first days. I don’t want to die because I keep on thinking of the future. I’m <em class="calibre5">desperately</em> curious to know what life will bring to me. What will happen to me, how I’ll develop, what I’ll be in five years’ time, in ten, in thirty. The man I will marry and the places I will live in and get to know. Children. It isn’t just a selfish curiosity. This is the worst possible time in history to die. Space-travel, science, the whole world waking up and stretching itself. A new age is beginning. I know it’s dangerous. But it’s wonderful to be alive in it.</p>
<p class="calibre7">I love, I adore <em class="calibre5">my</em> age.</p>
<p class="space-break">I keep on having thoughts today. One was: uncreative men plus opportunity-to-create equals evil men.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Another one was: killing him was breaking my word to what I believe. Some people would say—you’re only a drop, your word-breaking is only a drop, it wouldn’t matter. But all the evil in the world’s made up of little drops. It’s silly talking about the unimportance of the little drops. The little drops and the ocean are the same thing.</p>
<p class="space-break">I’ve been daydreaming (not for the first time) about living with G.P. He deceives me, he leaves me, he is brutal and cynical with me, I am in despair. In these daydreams there isn’t much sex, it’s just our living together. In rather romantic surroundings. Sea-and-island northern landscapes. White cottages. Sometimes in the Mediterranean. We are together, very close in spirit. All silly magazine stuff, really, in the details. But there is the closeness of spirit. That is something real. And the situations I imagine (where he forsakes me) are real. I mean, it kills me to think of them.</p>
<p class="space-break">Sometimes I’m not very far from utter despair. No one knows I am alive any more. I’m given up for dead by now, I’m accepted for dead. There’s that—the real situation. And there are the future situations I sit on the bed here and think about: my <em class="calibre5">utter</em> love for some man; I know I can’t do things like love by halves, I know I have love pent up in me, I shall throw myself away, lose my heart and my body and my mind and soul to some cad like G.P. Who’ll betray me. I feel it. Everything is tender and rational at first in my daydreams of living with him, but I know it wouldn’t be in fact. It would be all passion and violence. Jealousy. Despair. Sour. Something would be killed in me. He would be hurt, too.</p>
<p class="calibre7">If he really loved me he couldn’t have sent me away.</p>
