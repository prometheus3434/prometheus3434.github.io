<p class="dl"><em class="calibre5">November 27th</em></p>
<p class="calibre7">Midnight.</p>
<p class="calibre7">I’ll never escape. It drives me mad. I must must must do something. I feel as if I’m at the earth’s heart. I’ve got the whole weight of the whole earth pressing in on this little box. It grows smaller smaller smaller. I can feel it contracting.</p>
<p class="calibre7">I want to scream sometimes. Till my voice is raw. To death.</p>
<p class="calibre7">I can’t write it. There aren’t the words.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Utter despair.</p>
<p class="space-break">I’ve been like that all day. A kind of endless panic in slow-motion.</p>
<p class="space-break">What can he have thought when he first got me here?</p>
<p class="calibre7">Something’s gone wrong in his plans. I’m not acting like the girl of his dreams I was. I’m his pig in a poke.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Is that why he keeps me? Hoping the dream Miranda will appear?</p>
<p class="calibre7">Perhaps I should be his dream-girl. Put my arms round him and kiss him. Praise him, pat him, stroke him. Kiss him.</p>
<p class="calibre7">I didn’t mean that. But it’s made me think.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Perhaps I really should kiss him. More than kiss him. Love him. Make Prince Charming step out.</p>
<p class="calibre7">I’m thinking hours between each sentence I write.</p>
<p class="calibre7">I’ve got to make him feel that finally I’ve been touched by his chivalry and so on and so on…</p>
<p class="calibre7">This is extraordinary.</p>
<p class="calibre7">He would have to act.</p>
<p class="calibre7">I am sure I can do it. At least he’s scrupulously clean. He never smells of anything but soap.</p>
<p class="newpage" id="calibre_pb_19">I’m going to sleep on it.</p>
