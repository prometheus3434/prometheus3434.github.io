<p class="dl"><em class="calibre5">November 21st</em></p>
<p class="calibre7">It’s the middle of the night. I can’t sleep.</p>
<p class="calibre7">I hate myself.</p>
<p class="calibre7">I nearly became a murderess tonight.</p>
<p class="calibre7">I shall never be the same again.</p>
<p class="calibre7">It is difficult to write. My hands are bound. I’ve got the gag off.</p>
<p class="calibre7">It all began at lunch. I realized that I was having to struggle not to be nice to him. Because I felt I must talk to someone. Even him. At least he is a human being. When he went away after lunch, I wanted to call him back to talk. What I felt was quite different from what I decided I should feel two days ago. So I made a new decision. I could never hit him with anything down here. I’ve watched him so much with that in mind. And he never turns his back to me. Besides, there’s no weapon. So I thought, I’ve got to get upstairs and find something, some means. I had several ideas.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Otherwise I was afraid I would fall into the old trap of pitying him.</p>
<p class="calibre7">So I was a bit nicer at supper-time and said I needed a bath (which I did). He went away, came back, we went up. And there, it seemed a sign, specially left for me, was a small axe. It was on the kitchen window-sill, which is next to the door. He must have been chopping wood outside and forgotten to hide it. My always being down here.</p>
<p class="calibre7">We passed indoors too quickly for me to do anything then.</p>
<p class="calibre7">But I lay in the bath and thought. I decided it must be done. I had to catch up the axe and hit him with the blunt end, knock him out. I hadn’t the least idea where on the head was the best place to hit or how hard it had to be.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Then I asked to go straight back. As we went out through the kitchen door, I dropped my talcum powder and things and stood to one side, towards the window-sill, as if I was looking to see where they’d gone. He did just what I wanted and bent forward to pick them up. I wasn’t nervous, I picked the axe up very neatly, I didn’t scrape the blade and it was the blunt end. But then… it was like waking up out of a bad dream. I had to hit him and I couldn’t but I had to.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Then he began to straighten up (all this happened in a flash, really) and I did hit him. But he was turning and I didn’t hit straight. Or hard enough. I mean, I lashed out in a panic at the last moment. He fell sideways, but I knew he wasn’t knocked out, he still kept hold of me, I suddenly felt I had to kill him or he would kill me. I hit him again, but he had his arm up, at the same time he kicked out and knocked me off my feet.</p>
<p class="calibre7">It was too horrible. Panting, straining, like animals. Then suddenly I knew it was—I don’t know, undignified. It sounds absurd, but that was it. Like a statue lying on its side. Like a fat woman trying to get up off the grass.</p>
<p class="calibre7">We got up, he pushed me roughly towards the door, keeping a tight hold of me. But that was all. I had a funny feeling it was the same for him—disgusting.</p>
<p class="calibre7">I thought someone may have heard, even though I couldn’t call out. But it was windy. Wet and cold. No one would have been out.</p>
<p class="newpage" id="calibre_pb_13">I’ve been lying on the bed. I soon stopped crying. I’ve been lying for hours in the dark and thinking.</p>
