<p class="dl"><em class="calibre5">November 23rd</em></p>
<p class="calibre7">I’ve just finished <em class="calibre5">Saturday Night and Sunday Morning</em>. It’s shocked me. It’s shocked me in itself and it’s shocked me because of where I am.</p>
<p class="calibre7">It shocked me in the same way as <em class="calibre5">Room at the Top</em> shocked me when I read it last year. I know they’re very clever, it must be wonderful to be able to write like Alan Sillitoe. Real, unphoney. Saying what you mean. If he was a painter it would be wonderful (he’d be like John Bratby, much better) he’d be able to set Nottingham down and it would be wonderful in paint. Because he painted so well, put down what he saw, people would admire him. But it isn’t enough to write well (I mean choose the right words and so on) to be a good writer. Because I think <em class="calibre5">Saturday Night and Sunday Morning</em> is disgusting. I think Arthur Seaton is disgusting. And I think the most disgusting thing of all is that Alan Sillitoe doesn’t show that he’s disgusted by his young man. I think they think young men like that are really rather fine.</p>
<p class="calibre7">I hated the way Arthur Seaton just doesn’t care about anything outside his own little life. He’s mean, narrow, selfish, brutal. Because he’s cheeky and hates his work and is successful with women, he’s supposed to be vital.</p>
<p class="calibre7">The only thing I like about him is the feeling that there is something there that could be used for good if it could be got at.</p>
<p class="calibre7">It’s the inwardness of such people. Their not caring what happens anywhere else in the world. In life.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Their being-in-a-box.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Perhaps Alan Sillitoe wanted to attack the society that produces such people. But he doesn’t make it clear. I know what he’s done, he’s fallen in love with what he’s painting. He started out to paint it as ugly as it is, but then its ugliness conquered him, and he started trying to cheat. To prettify.</p>
<p class="calibre7">It shocked me too because of Caliban. I see there’s something of Arthur Seaton in him, only in him it’s turned upside down. I mean, he has that hate of other things and other people outside his own type. He has that selfishness—it’s not even an honest selfishness, because he puts the blame on life and then enjoys being selfish with a free conscience. He’s obstinate, too.</p>
<p class="calibre7">This has shocked me because I think everyone now except <em class="calibre5">us</em> (and we’re contaminated) has this selfishness and this brutality, whether it’s hidden, mousy, and perverse, or obvious and crude. Religion’s as good as dead, there’s nothing to hold back the New People, they’ll grow stronger and stronger and swamp us.</p>
<p class="calibre7">No, they won’t. Because of David. Because of people like Alan Sillitoe (it says on the back he was the son of a labourer). I mean the intelligent New People will always revolt and come across to our side. The New People destroy themselves because they’re so stupid. They can never keep the intelligent ones with them. Especially the young ones. We want something better than just money and keeping up with the Joneses.</p>
<p class="calibre7">But it’s a battle. It’s like being in a city and being besieged. They’re all around. And we’ve got to hold out.</p>
<p class="calibre7">It’s a battle between Caliban and myself. He is the New People and I am the Few.</p>
<p class="calibre7">I must fight with my weapons. Not his. Not selfishness and brutality and shame and resentment.</p>
<p class="calibre7">He’s worse than the Arthur Seaton kind.</p>
<p class="newpage" id="calibre_pb_15">If Arthur Seaton saw a modern statue he didn’t like, he’d smash it. But Caliban would drape a tarpaulin round it. I don’t know which is worse. But I think Caliban’s way is.</p>
