<p class="calibre7">I’ve been up for a bath and we’ve been looking at the room I shall occupy. He has done some things. He’s going to see if he can’t find an antique windsor chair. I drew it for him.</p>
<p class="calibre7">It’s made me feel happy.</p>
<p class="calibre7">I’m restless. I can’t write here. I feel half-escaped already.</p>
<p class="space-break">The thing that made me feel he was more normal was this little bit of dialogue.</p>

<p class="speaker">M. (<em class="calibre5">we were standing in the room</em>) Why don’t you just let me come and live up here as your guest? If I gave you my word of honour?</p>

<p class="speaker">C. If fifty people came to me, real honest respectable people, and swore blind you wouldn’t escape, I wouldn’t trust them. I wouldn’t trust the whole world.</p>
