<p class="dl"><em class="calibre5">December 3rd</em></p>
<p class="calibre7">I shall go and have an <em class="calibre5">affaire</em> with G.P.</p>
<p class="calibre7">I’ll marry him if he wants.</p>
<p class="calibre7">I want the adventure, the risk of marrying him.</p>
<p class="calibre7">I’m sick of being young. Inexperienced.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Clever at knowing but not at living.</p>
<p class="calibre7">I want his children in me.</p>
<p class="calibre7">My body doesn’t count any more. If he just wants that he can have it. I couldn’t ever be a Toinette. A collector of men.</p>
<p class="space-break">Being cleverer (as I thought) than most men, and cleverer than all the girls I knew. I always thought I knew more, felt more, understood more.</p>
<p class="calibre7">But I don’t even know enough to handle Caliban.</p>
<p class="calibre7">All sorts of bits left over from Ladymont days. From the days when I was a nice little middle-class doctor’s daughter. They’ve gone now. When I was at Ladymont I thought I could manipulate a pencil very nicely. And then when I went to London, I began to find I couldn’t. I was surrounded by people who were just as skilled as I was. More so. I haven’t begun to know how to handle my life—or anyone else’s.</p>
<p class="calibre7">I’m the one who needs lameducking.</p>
<p class="calibre7">It’s like the day you realize dolls are dolls. I pick up my old self and I see it’s silly. A toy I’ve played with too often. It’s a little sad, like an old golliwog at the bottom of the cupboard.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Innocent and used-up and proud and silly.</p>
<p class="space-break">G.P.</p>
<p class="calibre7">I shall be hurt, lost, battered and buffeted. But it will be like being in a gale of light, after this black hole.</p>
<p class="calibre7">It’s simply that. He has the secret of life in him. Something spring-like. Not immoral.</p>
<p class="calibre7">It’s as if I’d only seen him at twilight; and now suddenly I see him at dawn. He is the same, but everything is different.</p>
<p class="calibre7">I looked in the mirror today and I could see it in my eyes. They look much older and younger. It sounds impossible in words. But that’s exactly it. I am older and younger. I am older because I have learnt, I am younger because a lot of me consisted of things older people had taught me. All the mud of their stale ideas on the shoe of me.</p>
<p class="calibre7">The new shoe of me.</p>
<p class="space-break">The power of women! I’ve never felt so full of mysterious power. Men are a joke.</p>
<p class="calibre7">We’re so weak physically, so helpless with things. Still, even today. But we’re stronger than they are. We can stand their cruelty. They can’t stand ours.</p>
<p class="calibre7">I think—I will give myself to G.P. He can have me. And whatever he does to me I shall still have my woman-me he can never touch.</p>
<p class="calibre7">All this is wild talk. But I feel full of urges. New independence.</p>
<p class="calibre7">I don’t think about now. Today. I know I’m going to escape. I feel it. I can’t explain. Caliban can never win against me.</p>
<p class="calibre7">I think of paintings I shall do.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Last night I thought of one, it was a sort of butter-yellow (farm-butter-yellow) field rising to a white luminous sky and the sun just rising. A strange rose-pink, I knew it exactly, full of hushed stillness, the beginning of things, lark-song without larks.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Two strange contradictory dreams.</p>
<p class="calibre7">The first one was very simple. I was walking in the fields, I don’t know who I was with, but it was someone I liked very much, a man. G.P. perhaps. The sun shining on young corn. And suddenly we saw swallows flying low over the corn. I could see their backs gleaming, like dark blue silk. They were very low, twittering all around us, all flying in the same direction, low and happy. And I felt full of happiness. I said, how extraordinary, look at the swallows. It was very simple, the unexpected swallows and the sun and the green corn. I was filled with happiness. The <em class="calibre5">purest</em> spring feeling. Then I woke up.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Later I had another dream. I was at the window on the first floor of a large house (Ladymont?) and there was a black horse below. It was angry, but I felt safe because it was below and outside. But suddenly it turned and galloped at the house and to my horror it leapt gigantically up and straight at me with bared teeth. It came crashing through the window. Even then I thought, it will kill itself, I am safe. But it sprawled and flailed round in the small room and I suddenly realized it was going to attack me. There was nowhere to escape. I woke again, I had to put on the light.</p>
<p class="newpage" id="calibre_pb_24">It was violence. It was all I hate and all I fear.</p>
