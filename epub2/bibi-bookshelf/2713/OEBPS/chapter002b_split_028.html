<p class="dl"><em class="calibre5">December 7th</em></p>
<p class="calibre7">He’s bought the chair. He brought it down. It’s nice. I wouldn’t have it down here. I don’t want anything from down here. A complete change.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Tomorrow I’m going upstairs for good. I asked him afterwards, last night. And he agreed. I haven’t got to wait the whole week.</p>
<p class="calibre7">He’s gone into Lewes to buy more things for the room. We’re going to have a celebration supper.</p>
<p class="calibre7">He’s been much nicer, these last two days.</p>
<p class="calibre7">I’m not going to lose my head and try and rush out at the first chance. He’ll watch me, I know. I can’t imagine what he’ll do. The window will be boarded and he’ll lock the door. But there’ll be ways of seeing daylight. Sooner or later there’ll be a chance (if he doesn’t let me go of his own accord) to run for it.</p>
<p class="calibre7">But I know it will be only one chance. If he caught me escaping he’d put me straight back down here.</p>
<p class="calibre7">So it must be a really good chance. A sure one.</p>
<p class="calibre7">I tell myself I must prepare for the worst.</p>
<p class="calibre7">But something about him makes me feel that this time he will do what he has said.</p>
<p class="space-break">I’ve caught his cold. It doesn’t matter.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Oh my God my God I could kill myself.</p>
<p class="calibre7">He’s going to kill me with despair.</p>
<p class="calibre7">I’m still down here. He never meant it.</p>
<p class="calibre7">He wants to take photographs. That’s his secret. He wants to take my clothes off and… oh God I never knew till now what loathing was.</p>
<p class="calibre7">He said unspeakable things to me. I was a street-woman, I asked for what he suggested.</p>
<p class="calibre7">I went mad with rage. I threw a bottle of ink at him.</p>
<p class="calibre7">He said that if I didn’t do it he’d stop me having baths or going out in the cellar. I’ll be here all the time.</p>
<p class="calibre7">The hate between us. It came seething out.</p>
<p class="calibre7">I’ve caught his wretched cold. I can’t think straight.</p>
<p class="calibre7">I couldn’t kill myself, I’m too angry with him.</p>
<p class="calibre7">He’s always abused me. From the very beginning. That story about the dog. He uses my heart. Then turns and tramples on it.</p>
<p class="calibre7">He hates me, he wants to defile me and break me and destroy me. He wants me to hate myself so much that I destroy myself.</p>
<p class="calibre7">The final meanness. He’s not bringing me any supper. I’m to fast, on top of everything else. Perhaps he’s going to leave me to starve. He’s capable of it.</p>
<p class="calibre7">I’ve got over the shock. He won’t beat me. I won’t give in. I won’t be broken by him.</p>
<p class="calibre7">I’ve got a temperature, I feel sick.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Everything’s against me, but I won’t give in.</p>
<p class="calibre7">I’ve been lying on the bed with G.P.’s picture beside me. Holding the frame in one hand. Like a crucifix.</p>
<p class="calibre7">I will survive. I will escape. I will not give in.</p>
<p class="calibre7">I will not give in.</p>
<p class="calibre7">I hate God. I hate whatever made this world, I hate whatever made the human race, made men like Caliban possible and situations like this possible.</p>
<p class="calibre7">If there is a God he’s a great loathsome spider in the darkness.</p>
<p class="calibre7">He <em class="calibre5">cannot be good</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre7">This pain, this terrible seeing-through that is in me now. It wasn’t necessary. It is all pain, and it buys nothing. Gives birth to nothing.</p>
<p class="calibre7">All in vain. All wasted.</p>
<p class="calibre7">The older the world becomes, the more obvious it is. The bomb and the tortures in Algeria and the starving babies in the Congo. It gets bigger and darker.</p>
<p class="calibre7">More and more suffering for more and more. And more and more in vain.</p>
<p class="calibre7">It’s as if the lights have fused. I’m here in the black truth.</p>
<p class="calibre7">God is impotent. He can’t love us. He hates us because he can’t love us.</p>
<p class="calibre7">All the meanness and the selfishness and the lies.</p>
<p class="calibre7">People won’t admit it, they’re too busy grabbing to see that the lights have fused. They can’t see the darkness and the spider-face beyond and the great web of it all. That there’s always this if you scratch at the surface of happiness and goodness.</p>
<p class="calibre7">The black and the black and the black.</p>
<p class="calibre7">I’ve not only never felt like this before, I never imagined it possible. More than hatred, more than despair. You can’t hate what you cannot touch, I can’t even feel what most people think of as despair. It’s beyond despair. It’s as if I can’t feel any more. I see, but I can’t feel.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Oh God if there is a God.</p>
<p class="calibre7">I hate beyond hate.</p>
<p class="calibre7">He came down just now. I was asleep on top of the bed. Fever.</p>
<p class="calibre7">The air so stuffy. It must be flu.</p>
<p class="calibre7">I felt so rotten I said nothing. No energy to say my hate.</p>
<p class="calibre7">The bed’s damp. My chest hurts.</p>
<p class="calibre7">I didn’t say a word to him. It’s gone beyond words. I wish I was a Goya. Could draw the absolute hate I have in me for him.</p>
<p class="calibre7">I’m so frightened. I don’t know what will happen if I’m really ill. I can’t understand why my chest hurts. As if I’ve had bronchitis for days.</p>
<p class="calibre7">But he’d have to get a doctor. He might kill me, but he couldn’t just let me die.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Oh, God, this is horrible.</p>
<p class="space-break">(Evening.) He brought a thermometer. It was a 100 at lunch, and now it’s a 101. I feel <em class="calibre5">terrible</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre7">I’ve been in bed all day.</p>
<p class="calibre7">He’s not human.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Oh God I’m so lonely so utterly alone.</p>
<p class="calibre7">I can’t write.</p>
<p class="calibre7">(Morning.) A really bad bronchial cold. Shivering.</p>
<p class="calibre7">I haven’t slept properly. Horrid dreams. Weird, very vivid dreams. G.P. was in one. It made me cry. I feel so frightened.</p>
<p class="calibre7">I can’t eat. There’s a pain in my lung when I breathe, and I keep on thinking of pneumonia. But it can’t be.</p>
<p class="calibre7">I won’t die. I won’t die. Not for Caliban.</p>
<p class="space-break">Dream. Extraordinary.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Walking in the Ash Grove at L. I look up through the trees. I see an aeroplane in the blue sky. I know it will crash. Later I see where it has crashed. I am frightened to go on. A girl walks towards me. Minny? I can’t see. She is in peculiar Greek clothes—drapery. White. In sunshine through the still trees. Seems to know me but I do not know her (not Minny). Never close. I want to be close. With her. I wake up.</p>
<p class="calibre7">If I die, no one will ever know.</p>
<p class="calibre7">It puts me in a fever. I can’t write.</p>
<p class="calibre7">(Night.) No pity. No God.</p>
<p class="calibre7">I shouted at him and he went mad. I was too weak to stop him. Bound and gagged me and took his beastly photographs.</p>
<p class="calibre7">I don’t mind the pain. The humiliation.</p>
<p class="calibre7">I did what he wanted. To get it over.</p>
<p class="calibre7">I don’t mind for myself any more.</p>
<p class="calibre7">But oh God the beastliness of it all.</p>
<p class="calibre7">I’m crying I’m crying I can’t write.</p>
<p class="space-break">I will not give in.</p>
<p class="newpage" id="calibre_pb_28">I will not give in.</p>
