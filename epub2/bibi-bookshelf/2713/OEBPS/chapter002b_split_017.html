<p class="dl"><em class="calibre5">November 25th</em></p>
<p class="calibre7">(Afternoon.) This morning I had a talk with him. I got him to sit as a model. Then I asked him what he really wanted me to do. Should I become his mistress? But that shocked him. He went red and said he could buy <em class="calibre5">that</em> in London.</p>
<p class="calibre7">I told him he was a Chinese box. And he is.</p>
<p class="calibre7">The innermost box is that I should love him; in all ways. With my body, with my mind. Respect him and cherish him. It’s so utterly impossible—even if I could overcome the physical thing, how could I ever look in any way but down on him?</p>
<p class="calibre7">Battering his head on a stone wall.</p>
<p class="newpage" id="calibre_pb_17">I don’t want to die. I feel full of endurance. I shall <em class="calibre5">always</em> want to survive. I will survive.</p>
