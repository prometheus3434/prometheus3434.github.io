<p class="noindent">John Fowles (1926–2005) was educated at Oxford and subsequently lectured in English at universities in Greece and the UK. The success of his first novel, <em class="calibre5">The Collector</em>, published in 1963, allowed him to devote all his time to writing. His books include the internationally acclaimed and bestselling novels <em class="calibre5">The Magus, The French Lieutenant’s Woman</em>, and <em class="calibre5">Daniel Martin</em>. Fowles spent the last decades of his life on the southern coast of England in the small harbor town of Lyme Regis.</p>
