<p class="dl"><em class="calibre5">November 7th</em></p>
<p class="calibre7">How the days drag. Today. Intolerably long.</p>
<p class="calibre7">My one consolation is G.P.’s drawing. It grows on me. On one. It’s the only living, unique, created thing here. It’s the first thing I look at when I wake up, the last thing at night. I stand in front of it and stare at it. I know every line. He made a fudge of one of her feet. There’s something slightly unbalanced about the whole composition, as if there’s a tiny bit missing somewhere. But it lives.</p>
<p class="calibre7">After supper (we’re back to normal) Caliban handed me <em class="calibre5">The Catcher in the Rye</em> and said, I’ve read it. I knew at once by his tone that he meant—“and I don’t think much of it.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">I feel awake, I’ll do a dialogue.</p>
<div class="box">
<div class="calibre2">
<p class="speaker">M. Well?</p>
</div>
<div class="calibre2">
<p class="speaker">C. I don’t see much point in it.</p>
</div>
<div class="calibre2">
<p class="speaker">M. You realize this is one of the most brilliant studies of adolescence ever written?</p>
</div>
<div class="calibre2">
<p class="speaker">C. He sounds a mess to me.</p>
</div>
<div class="calibre2">
<p class="speaker">M. Of course he’s a mess. But he realizes he’s a mess, he tries to express what he feels, he’s a human being for all his faults. Don’t you even feel sorry for him?</p>
</div>
<div class="calibre2">
<p class="speaker">C. I don’t like the way he talks.</p>
</div>
<div class="calibre2">
<p class="speaker">M. I don’t like the way you talk. But I don’t treat you as below any serious notice or sympathy.</p>
</div>
<div class="calibre2">
<p class="speaker">C. I suppose it’s very clever. To write like that and all.</p>
</div>
<div class="calibre2">
<p class="speaker">M. I gave you that book to read because I thought you would feel identified with him. You’re a Holden Caulfield. He doesn’t fit anywhere and you don’t.</p>
</div>
<div class="calibre2">
<p class="speaker">C. I don’t wonder, the way he goes on. He doesn’t try to fit.</p>
</div>
<div class="calibre2">
<p class="speaker">M. He tries to construct some sort of reality in his life, some sort of decency.</p>
</div>
<div class="calibre2">
<p class="speaker">C. It’s not realistic. Going to a posh school and his parents having money. He wouldn’t behave like that. In my opinion.</p>
</div>
<div class="calibre2">
<p class="speaker">M. I know what you are. You’re the Old Man of the Sea.</p>
</div>
<div class="calibre2">
<p class="speaker">C. Who’s he?</p>
</div>
<div class="calibre2">
<p class="speaker">M. The horrid old man Sinbad had to carry on his back. That’s what you are. You get on the back of everything vital, everything trying to be honest and free, and you bear it down.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="calibre7">I won’t go on. We argued—no, we don’t argue, I say things and he tries to wriggle out of them.</p>
<p class="calibre7">It’s true. He is the Old Man of the Sea. I can’t stand stupid people like Caliban, with their great deadweight of pettiness and selfishness and meanness of every kind. And the few have to carry it all. The doctors and the teachers and the artists—not that they haven’t their traitors, but what hope there is, is with them—with us.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Because I’m one of them.</p>
<p class="calibre7">I’m one of them. I feel it and I’ve tried to prove it. I felt it during my last year at Ladymont. There were the few of us who cared, and there were the silly ones, the snobbish ones, the would-be debutantes and the daddy’s darlings and the horsophiles and the sex-cats. I’ll never go back to Ladymont. Because I couldn’t stand that suffocating atmosphere of the “done” thing and the “right” people and the “nice” behaviour. (Boadicaea writing “in spite of her weird political views” on my report—how dared she?) I <em class="calibre5">will</em> not be an old girl of such a place.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Why <em class="calibre5">should</em> we tolerate their beastly Calibanity? Why should every vital and creative and good person be martyred by the great universal stodge around?</p>
<p class="calibre7">In this situation I’m a representative.</p>
<p class="calibre7">A martyr. Imprisoned, unable to grow. At the mercy of this resentment, this hateful millstone envy of the Calibans of this world. Because they all hate us, they hate us for being different, for not being them, for their own not being like us. They persecute us, they crowd us out, they send us to Coventry, they sneer at us, they yawn at us, they blindfold themselves and stuff up their ears. They do anything to avoid having to take notice of us and respect us. They go crawling after the great ones among us when they’re dead. They pay thousands and thousands for the Van Goghs and Modiglianis they’d have spat on at the time they were painted. Guffawed at. Made coarse jokes about.</p>
<p class="calibre7">I hate them.</p>
<p class="calibre7">I hate the uneducated and the ignorant. I hate the pompous and the phoney. I hate the jealous and the resentful. I hate the crabbed and the mean and the petty. I hate all ordinary dull little people who aren’t ashamed of being dull and little. I hate what G.P. calls the New People, the new-class people with their cars and their money and their tellies and their stupid vulgarities and their stupid crawling imitation of the bourgeoisie.</p>
<p class="calibre7">I love honesty and freedom and giving. I love making, I love doing. I love being to the full, I love everything which is not sitting and watching and copying and dead at heart.</p>
<p class="calibre7">G.P. was laughing at my being Labour one day (early on). I remember he said, you are supporting the party which brought the New People into existence—do you realize that?</p>
<p class="calibre7">I said (I was shocked, because from what he had said about other things, I thought he must be Labour, I knew he had been a Communist once), I’d rather we had the New People than poor people.</p>
<p class="calibre7">He said, the New People are still the poor people. Theirs is the new form of poverty. The others hadn’t any money and these haven’t any soul.</p>
<p class="calibre7">He suddenly said, have you read <em class="calibre5">Major Barbara</em>?</p>
<p class="calibre7">How it proved people had to be saved financially before you could save their souls.</p>
<p class="calibre7">They forgot one thing, he said. They brought in the Welfare State, but they forgot Barbara herself. Affluence, affluence, and not a soul to see.</p>
<p class="calibre7">I know he’s wrong somewhere (he was exaggerating). One <em class="calibre5">must</em> be on the Left. Every decent person I’ve ever met has been anti-Tory. But I see what he feels, I mean I feel it myself more and more, this awful deadweight of the fat little New People on everything. Corrupting everything. Vulgarizing everything. Raping the countryside, as D says in his squire moods. Everything mass-produced. Mass-everything.</p>
<p class="calibre7">I know we’re supposed to face the herd, control the stampede—it’s like a Wild West film. Work for them and tolerate them. I shall never go to the Ivory Tower, that’s the most despicable thing, to choose to leave life because it doesn’t suit you. But sometimes it is frightening, thinking of the struggle life is if one takes it seriously.</p>
<p class="calibre7">All this is talk. Probably I shall meet someone and fall in love with him and marry him and things will seem to change and I shan’t care any more. I shall become a Little Woman. One of the enemy.</p>
<p class="calibre7">But this <em class="calibre5">is</em> what I feel these days. That I belong to a sort of band of people who have to stand against all the rest. I don’t know who they are—famous men, dead and living, who’ve fought for the right things and created and painted in the right way, and unfamous people I know who don’t lie about things, who try not to be lazy, who try to be human and intelligent. Yes, people like G.P., for all his faults. His Fault.</p>
<p class="calibre7">They’re not even good people. They have weak moments. Sex moments and drink moments. Coward and money moments. They have holidays in the Ivory Tower. But a part of them is one with the band.</p>
