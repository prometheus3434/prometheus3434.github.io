<p class="dl"><em class="calibre5">December 1st</em></p>
<p class="calibre7">He’s been down, I’ve been out in the cellar, and it is absolutely plain. He’s angry with me. He’s never been angry like this before. This isn’t a pet. It’s a deep suppressed anger.</p>
<p class="calibre7">It makes me furious. Nobody could ever understand how much I put into yesterday. The effort of giving, of risking, of understanding. Of pushing back every natural instinct.</p>
<p class="calibre7">It’s him. And it’s this weird male thing. Now I’m no longer nice. They sulk if you don’t give, and hate you when you do. Intelligent men must despise themselves for being like that. Their illogicality.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Sour men and wounded women.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Of course, I’ve discovered his secret. He hates that.</p>
<p class="calibre7">I’ve thought and thought about it.</p>
<p class="calibre7">He must always have known he couldn’t do anything with me. Yet all his talk about loving me. That must mean something.</p>
<p class="calibre7">This is what I think it is. He can’t have any normal pleasure from me. His pleasure is keeping me prisoner. Thinking of all the other men who would envy him if they knew. Having me.</p>
<p class="calibre7">So my being nice to him is ridiculous. I want to be so unpleasant that he gets no pleasure from having me. I’m going to fast again. Have absolutely nothing to do with him.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Strange ideas.</p>
<p class="calibre7">That I’ve done for the first time in my life something original. Something hardly anyone else can have done. I steeled myself when we were naked. I learnt what “to steel oneself” meant.</p>
<p class="calibre7">The last of the Ladymont me. It’s dead.</p>
<p class="calibre7">I remember driving Piers’s car somewhere near Carcassonne. They all wanted me to stop. But I wanted to do eighty. And I kept my foot down until I did. The others were frightened. So was I.</p>
<p class="calibre7">But it proved I could do it.</p>
<p class="space-break">(Late afternoon.) Reading <em class="calibre5">The Tempest</em> again all the afternoon. Not the same at all, now what’s happened has happened. The pity Shakespeare feels for his Caliban, I feel (beneath the hate and disgust) for my Caliban. Half-creatures.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Not honour’d with a human shape.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Caliban my slave, who never yields us kind answer.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Whom stripes may move, not kindness.”</p>
<div class="box">
<div class="calibre2">
<p class="speaker"><span class="small-caps">PROS</span>…. and lodged thee<br class="calibre2"/>In mine own cell, till thou didst seek to violate<br class="calibre2"/>The honour of my child.</p>
</div>
<div class="calibre2">
<p class="speaker"><span class="small-caps">CAL</span>. O ho, O ho!—Would’t had been done!<br class="calibre2"/>Thou didst prevent me; I had peopled else<br class="calibre2"/>This isle with Calibans….</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="calibre7">Prospero’s contempt for him. His knowing that being kind is useless.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Stephano and Trinculo are the football pools. Their wine, the money he won.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Act III, scene 2. “I cried to dream again.” Poor Caliban. But only because <em class="calibre5">he</em> never won the pools.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“I’ll be wise hereafter.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“O brave new world.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">O sick new world.</p>
<p class="calibre7">He’s just gone. I said I would fast unless he let me come upstairs. Fresh air and daylight every day. He hedged. He was beastly. Sarcastic. He actually said I was “forgetting who was boss.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">He’s changed. He frightens me now.</p>
<p class="newpage" id="calibre_pb_22">I’ve given him until tomorrow morning to make up his mind.</p>
