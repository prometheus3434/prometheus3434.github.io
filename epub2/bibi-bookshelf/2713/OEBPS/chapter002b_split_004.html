<p class="dl"><em class="calibre5">November 5th</em></p>
<p class="calibre7">I gave him hell tonight.</p>
<p class="calibre7">I started throwing things around upstairs. First cushions and then plates. I’ve been longing to break them.</p>
<p class="calibre7">But I was beastly, really. Spoilt. He suffered it all. He’s so weak. He ought to have slapped me across the face.</p>
<p class="calibre7">He did catch hold of me, to stop me breaking another of his wretched plates. We so rarely touch. I hated it. It was like icy water.</p>
<p class="calibre7">I lectured him. I told him all about himself and what he ought to do in life. But he doesn’t listen. He likes me to talk about him. It doesn’t matter what I say.</p>
<p class="calibre7">I won’t write any more. I’m reading <em class="calibre5">Sense and Sensibility</em> and I must find out what happens to Marianne. Marianne is me; Eleanor is me as I ought to be.</p>
<p class="space-break">What happens if he has a crash? A stroke. Anything.</p>
<p class="calibre7">I die.</p>
<p class="newpage" id="calibre_pb_4">I couldn’t get out. All I did the day before yesterday was to prove it.</p>
