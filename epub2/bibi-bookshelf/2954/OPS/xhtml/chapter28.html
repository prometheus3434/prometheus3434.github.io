<p class="center2"><span>How do I tell you you’re the cause of my ruination<br/>The ten hands of fate had something to do with it too</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="big"><img alt="image" class="block" src="../images/t.jpg"/></span>he city of Bombay used to talk to me, Mirza sahib. And why shouldn’t it, after all? There were so many similarities in our lives, Bombay’s and mine, that sometimes I thought the city had been waiting for my arrival. Even when I went to Lahore after the Partition, my brothers, I felt as though I was still in Bombay. My love affair with Bombay lasted twelve years; when I left the city, I felt like a bird crippled by the loss of its wings. It was Bombay that had offered shelter to a vagabond like me. Whether you earn two paise or ten thousand rupees a day here, Manto—Bombay had whispered in my ear—you can enjoy yourself thoroughly if you want to. Or you can spend your life here as the unhappiest man in the world. You can do exactly as you please. No one will try to find fault with you. No one will badger you to become a good person. You will have to do all the difficult things yourself, yes, you will have to take the most important decisions all by yourself too. You can live on the pavement, or you can live in a palace; it makes no difference to me. It won’t even make any difference to me if you leave me. I will be exactly where I am now. Bombay took me by the hand and familiarized me with all its lanes and bylanes, with its refined neighbourhoods, with the sea, with its nights and days, with its thrills and delights, and sins and downfalls. Sometimes I feel that if I ever loved anyone, it was this city, and nobody else.</p>
<p class="indent">My life was very insignificant compared to Mirza sahib’s, my brothers. So if I have to tell the story of my life, I have to talk about many other people. Bombay made me learn about all these people. I knew all the characters in my stories; not just knew—I had actually lived with them, they were companions of my soul. Whatever I wrote, all … all of it was personal, all of it about things that I had seen and heard and known for myself. I was not inspired by any particular kind of politics. Which was why terms like progressive and reactionary were fired at me at different points of time. There has never been a literature more hideous and dishonest than the stories and novels published on thousands of tons of paper under the label of progressive literature in the Soviet Union. It cannot be called literature. I never looked at the world through a political or philosophical filter, my brothers. I tried to understand it in my own way—even when I heard a story about someone I had never seen, I tried to understand what life had brought for us. Let me tell you Pairan’s story then. I had never seen Pairan, I had only heard about her from Brijmohan, but still she is the principal character in this story. Pairan was Bombay’s soul, as it were.</p>
<p class="indent">I used to live in the kholi that I’ve told you about. Brijmohan lived in the room next to mine. Every Sunday he would go to Bandra to meet his girlfriend Pairan. Pairan was a Parsi girl. I couldn’t quite make out what Brijmohan’s real relationship with her was. Why did he actually go to Bandra every Sunday? Pairan was like a powerful addiction in his life. I had to lend him eight annas every time for the journey. He would spend several hours with her before returning. ‘What do you do with her?’ I had asked him. ‘Do you go out, or do you stay at home and kiss her?’</p>
<p class="indent">— Oh no! Brijmohan laughed. ‘I solve crossword puzzles for Pairan.’</p>
<p class="indent">— Crossword puzzles?</p>
<p class="indent">— They’re published in the <i>Illustrated Weekly</i>. Pairan sends entries. She’s won many prizes.</p>
<p class="indent">Brijmohan had no work. He would sit in his shack and solve crossword puzzles for Pairan. One day I asked, ‘Pairan wins the prizes. What do you get?’</p>
<p class="indent">— Nothing.</p>
<p class="indent">— Doesn’t she share the prize money with you?</p>
<p class="indent">— No.</p>
<p class="indent">— Why? You’re the one who solves them, after all.</p>
<p class="indent">— So what? Pairan sends the entries with her own name. She wins the prizes. Why should she share the money with me?</p>
<p class="indent">— You’re a total idiot.</p>
<p class="indent">Brijmohan would laugh, displaying yellow teeth.</p>
<p class="indent">He used to take photographs. He showed me many photographs of Pairan’s. In different poses and outfits. In a shalwar kameez, in a sari, in a shirt and slacks, even in a swimming costume. She didn’t appear remotely pretty in the photographs. But I never told Brijmohan this, Mirza sahib. Beauty lies in the eye of the beholder. As they say, it’s my senses that make the emerald green. I never asked Brijmohan questions about Pairan. He didn’t tell me anything of his own accord either. All I knew was that every Sunday Brijmohan would ask me for eight annas after breakfast, and I would have to give him the money. He always returned by lunchtime. One Sunday, when he came back Brijmohan said, ‘I’ve ended it all.’</p>
<p class="indent">— Meaning?</p>
<p class="indent">— I never told you this before, Manto bhai. Pairan is actually the angel of death in my life. Whenever I meet her, I lose my job. I told her this today.</p>
<p class="indent">— What did she have to say to that?</p>
<p class="indent">— Then don’t meet me anymore, she said. Look for a job instead. Maybe you think you’re not getting a job because of me, but the fault is actually yours. You don’t really want to work.</p>
<p class="indent">— What did you say?</p>
<p class="indent">— Never mind all that, Manto bhai. I’m positively going to get a job tomorrow. Just give me four annas in the morning. I’m going to meet Seth Nanubhai.</p>
<p class="indent">Seth Nanubhai was a film director. He had refused Brijmohan a job many times in the past. But still I gave Brijmohan money for his bus fare the next day. At night, I heard that Nanubhai had given him a job. With a monthly salary of two hundred and fifty rupees to boot. Pulling a hundred rupee note out of his pocket, Brijmohan said, ‘Here’s the advance. I had a strong urge to go to Bandra and let Pairan know. Then I realized that if I did that, I would lose the job the very next day. This is how it has always been, Manto bhai. I get a job, inform Pairan, and I’m sacked. God alone knows what star she was born under. But I’m sure it was an evil star. Listen, Manto bhai, I’m going to spend at least a year away from her. I have to. Have you seen the state of my clothes? If I can keep my job for a year, I will at least be able to get myself some decent clothes.</p>
<p class="indent">Brijmohan didn’t visit Pairan in the next six months, Mirza sahib. He worked to his heart’s content, and bought himself new clothes. He was very fond of handkerchiefs. He bought many beautifully embroidered handkerchiefs. Suddenly a letter arrived for him. Reading it, Brijmohan exclaimed, ‘It’s all over, Manto bhai.’</p>
<p class="indent">— Why, what’s the matter?</p>
<p class="indent">— Pairan’s written.</p>
<p class="indent">— What’s she saying?</p>
<p class="indent">— She’s asked me to visit her on Sunday. Apparently she has a lot to tell me. It’s Saturday, isn’t it?</p>
<p class="indent">— Yes. So what?</p>
<p class="indent">— That means Seth Nanubhai will kick me out on Monday.</p>
<p class="indent">— Then don’t go to Pairan.</p>
<p class="indent">— Impossible, Manto bhai. I have to go if she wants me to.</p>
<p class="indent">— Why?</p>
<p class="indent">Brijmohan was silent for some time. Then he looked at me and chuckled. ‘I’m tired of working too, Manto bhai. It’s been six months, after all.’</p>
<p class="indent">Brijmohan went to Bandra the next day. He didn’t tell me anything about Pairan when he returned. ‘Let’s see what happens tomorrow,’ was all he said during dinner at Haji’s restaurant.</p>
<p class="indent">Brijmohan burst into laughter when he came back from office on Monday. —I knew it, Manto bhai, I knew it. Pairan has done what she had to.</p>
<p class="indent">— What’s the matter?</p>
<p class="indent">— The studio’s closed down, Manto bhai. I did it. If I hadn’t been to see Pairan yesterday …</p>
<p class="indent">Brijmohan went out with his camera slung around his neck. Where was he going with his camera at this hour of the night?</p>
<p class="indent">Brijmohan was jobless again. He ran out of his savings. The old system was resumed. Every Sunday he borrowed eight annas from me after breakfast, spent a few hours with Pairan, and returned.</p>
<p class="indent">One day I asked Brijmohan, ‘Does Pairan love you?’</p>
<p class="indent">— No.</p>
<p class="indent">— Then why do you visit her every Sunday?</p>
<p class="indent">— I can’t stay without going, Manto bhai.</p>
<p class="indent">— Does Pairan …</p>
<p class="indent">‘Yes, Pairan loves someone else,’ Brijmohan snarled. ‘But what’s wrong with that?’</p>
<p class="indent">— Nothing at all. But why does she send for you?</p>
<p class="indent">— She’s very lonely.</p>
<p class="indent">— Why?</p>
<p class="indent">— I don’t know. She hasn’t told me.</p>
<p class="indent">Flopping down on his bed and staring at the ceiling, Brijmohan continued, ‘Perhaps she finds me amusing. You need people who can amuse you, Manto bhai. Maybe because I take photographs of her. She looks much prettier in the photos, you see. Or, who knows, maybe it’s because I solve crossword puzzles for her. You’ll never understand these women, Manto bhai.</p>
<p class="indent">— Why not?</p>
<p class="indent">— Because you want love.</p>
<p class="indent">— And you?</p>
<p class="indent">— I don’t know. But I know women like Pairan.</p>
<p class="indent">— What are they like?</p>
<p class="indent">— They love someone, but when they don’t get what they want in this person, they look for it in someone else. And when they do, they coil themselves around him like a snake, but mentally. They’ll never let him near their bodies.</p>
<p class="indent">— Then why do you go?</p>
<p class="indent">— Because I like it.</p>
<p class="indent">— What is it you like? Pairan doesn’t give you anything.</p>
<p class="indent">Brijmohan smiled. —But she does. She makes her evil star work on me, Manto bhai. I’m just playing a game. Let me see how many dark clouds she can bring into my life. Pairan is peerless. Every time I visit her, I lose my job. I have just one wish.</p>
<p class="indent">— Which is?</p>
<p class="indent">— I want to cheat Pairan once.</p>
<p class="indent">— How?</p>
<p class="indent">Brijmohan was silent for a while. I could hear a rat gnawing away at something in the room. Getting off his bed, Brijmohan began to pace up and down. ‘Have you made your plan for cheating Pairan?’ I asked him again.</p>
<p class="indent">— Hmm …</p>
<p class="indent">— What is it?</p>
<p class="indent">— I will resign before I’m sacked. I will tell the boss directly, I know you’ll sack me, but I’m resigning so that you don’t have to do such a terrible thing. I’ll tell him something else too. It’s not you but Pairan who’s sacking me. That’s all I wish for, Manto bhai.</p>
<p class="indent">— What a strange wish.</p>
<p class="indent">— Yes.</p>
<p class="indent">Brijmohan left the room, returning after a long time. ‘Where did you go?’ I asked him.</p>
<p class="indent">— To look at the sky. I can’t stay in bed for long stretches at night, Manto bhai. I feel suffocated in the kholi. So I go out for a glimpse of the sky.</p>
<p class="indent">— What do you see, Brijmohan?</p>
<p class="indent">— Nothing.</p>
<p class="indent">— Do you look at the stars?</p>
<p class="indent">— I only see a dark blue, Manto bhai, in which my strange wishes twinkle. Last Sunday I took a photo of Pairan’s. Her lover will enter the photograph in a competition, under his own name. I’m sure the photo will win a prize, Manto bhai.</p>
<p class="indent">— Do you know the man?</p>
<p class="indent">— No. He’s won many prizes in the past with photographs of Pairan that I shot.</p>
<p class="indent">— Hasn’t Pairan said anything to you about him?</p>
<p class="indent">— No.</p>
<p class="indent">One Sunday, Brijmohan came back from Bandra and said, ‘This time I really have ended it all, Manto bhai. I’ll get a job very soon. Seth Niaz Ali is setting up a new production company. Can you get hold of his address for me?’</p>
<p class="indent">— Let me see.</p>
<p class="indent">I phoned a friend and got Seth Niaz Ali’s address. Brijmohan went to meet him the next day. When he came back, he hugged me and said, ‘I’ve got the job, Manto bhai. Two hundred rupees a month. But they’ll increase it soon. You’re happy, I hope.’</p>
<p class="indent">— I’m happy if you are.</p>
<p class="indent">— I’m so relieved. Brijmohan threw himself on his bed.</p>
<p class="indent">‘Aren’t you going to meet Pairan?’ I asked him the next day.</p>
<p class="indent">Brijmohan smiled. ‘I do want to. But no, Manto bhai, I’m not going to rush into anything this time. I have to buy some new clothes. Here, I’ve got an advance of fifty rupees, you keep twenty-five.’</p>
<p class="indent">— What for?</p>
<p class="indent">— Repaying my debt.</p>
<p class="indent">Times weren’t too bad, Mirza sahib. I was earning about a hundred rupees a month. Brijmohan was earning twice as much, of course. We didn’t particularly lack for money. You could say it was more than enough for life in a kholi.</p>
<p class="indent">About five months later, a letter arrived for Brijmohan. Glancing at the envelope he said, ‘The queen of death.’ I realized it was from Pairan.</p>
<p class="indent">Brijmohan opened the letter with a smile on his face. ‘She wants to meet on Sunday,’ he told me after reading the letter. ‘It’s urgent.’</p>
<p class="indent">— Will you go?</p>
<p class="indent">Brijmohan leapt up. —Of course I’ll go. How could you imagine, Manto bhai, that I wouldn’t go if Pairan called me?</p>
<p class="indent">Whistling a recent Hindi film song, Brijmohan sat on his bed, swinging his legs. I was silent for some time. Then I said, ‘There’s no need to go to Pairan, Brijmohan. You can’t imagine how difficult it is to give you eight annas every Sunday after you’ve been to see her.’</p>
<p class="indent">Brijmohan burst into laughter. —I know. Those days are coming back, Manto bhai. I have no idea where you will get eight annas to lend me every Sunday.</p>
<p class="indent">Brijmohan went to meet Pairan the very next morning. At night I asked him, ‘What did Pairan say?’</p>
<p class="indent">— Nothing.</p>
<p class="indent">— She said it was urgent.</p>
<p class="indent">— That’s her usual practice. She’s probably frightened all the time.</p>
<p class="indent">— Why?</p>
<p class="indent">— No one knows. But I told her, this is the twelfth time I’m going to be sacked because of you. May Zarathustra save you.</p>
<p class="indent">— What did Pairan say?</p>
<p class="indent">— You’re an idiot.</p>
<p class="indent">— She’s right. I smiled at her.</p>
<p class="indent">— Absolutely right. Brijmohan laughed. I’ll resign first thing tomorrow.</p>
<p class="indent">— Why?</p>
<p class="indent">— So that they can’t sack me. I wrote the resignation letter in Pairan’s room.</p>
<p class="indent">He handed me the letter.</p>
<p class="indent">Brijmohan left early the next morning. When I returned at night, I found him in bed, staring at the ceiling. ‘Whom will you go to for a job now?’ I asked him.</p>
<p class="indent">— Why? Brijmohan sat up in bed.</p>
<p class="indent">— Didn’t anything happen by Pairan’s grace?</p>
<p class="indent">Brijmohan stared at me without speaking. I saw tears trembling in his eyes. ‘I gave Seth Niaz Ali my resignation letter, Manto bhai,’ he rasped. ‘The seth handed me a letter a little later. My salary had been raised from two hundred rupees to three hundred.’</p>
<p class="indent">Brijmohan lost all interest in Pairan from that day onwards. Later he told me, ‘If Pairan’s curse doesn’t exist anymore, nor does Pairan. My life has lost all its excitement. Whom will I resign for now, Manto bhai?’</p>
<p class="indent">I saw Pairan for the first time that day. She had fallen asleep on the beach by the Arabian Sea. A dark ship rose and fell nearby on the waves. Bombay is a city of just such imaginary people, Mirza sahib.</p>
