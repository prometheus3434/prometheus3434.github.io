<p class="nonindent">People in any profession can profit from doing total relaxation every day or every week. Maybe there’s a place in the office where you can practice total relaxation for fifteen minutes. You can do it at home also. Once you have benefited from practicing on your own to renew yourself, you can offer a session of total relaxation to your whole family, and to your colleagues at work. You could have a session of total relaxation at your job every day. When coworkers and employees become overwhelmed by stress, they are much less effective in their work and often miss work because of sickness. This is very costly to the organization. So fifteen minutes of total relaxation after three or four hours of work is very practical. You may like to lead the total relaxation yourself. You will experience a lot of joy doing this. When you’re able to make people happy and relaxed, your own happiness increases at the same time.</p>
<p class="indent">When we do deep relaxation in a group, one person can guide the exercise using the following instructions, or some variation of them. You may want to invite a bell at the beginning and end of the exercise to help people more easily enter a relaxed state of mind. When you do deep relaxation on your own, you can make a recording that you can play to guide you.</p>

<p class="nonindent"><em>Lie down on your back with your arms at your sides. Make yourself comfortable. Allow your body to relax. Be aware of the floor underneath you … and of the contact of your body with the floor. Allow your body to sink into the floor.</em></p>
<p class="indent"> <a id="page246"/><em>Become aware of your breathing, in and out. Be aware of your abdomen rising and falling as you breathe in and out… rising… falling… rising … falling.</em></p>
<p class="indent"><em>Breathing in, breathing out … your whole body feels light … like a water lily floating on the water… You have nowhere to go… nothing to do … You are free as the cloud floating in the sky.</em></p>
<p class="indent"><em>Breathing in, bring your awareness to your eyes. Breathing out, allow your eyes to relax. Allow your eyes to sink back into your head … let go of the tension in all the tiny muscles around your eyes … our eyes allow us to see a paradise of forms and colors … allow your eyes to rest… send love and gratitude to your eyes.</em></p>
<p class="indent"><em>Breathing in, bring your awareness to your mouth. Breathing out, allow your mouth to relax. Release the tension around your mouth … your lips are the petals of a flower… let a gentle smile bloom on your lips… smiling releases the tension in the hundreds of muscles in your face … feel the tension release in your cheeks … your jaw … your throat.</em></p>
<p class="indent"><em>Breathing in, bring your awareness to your shoulders. Breathing out, allow your shoulders to relax. Let them sink into the floor… let all the accumulated tension flow into the floor … we carry so much with our shoulders … now let them relax as we care for our shoulders.</em></p>
<p class="indent"><em>Breathing in, become aware of your arms. Breathing out, relax your arms. Let your arms sink into the floor… your upper arms… your elbows … your lower arms … your wrists … hands … fingers … all the tiny muscles … move your fingers a little if you need to, to help the muscles relax.</em></p>
<p class="indent"><em>Breathing in, bring your awareness to your heart. Breathing out, allow your heart to relax. We have neglected our heart for a long time by the way we work, eat, and deal with anxiety and stress. Our heart beats for us night and day. Embrace your heart with mindfulness and tenderness, reconciling with and taking care of your heart.</em></p>
<p class="indent"><em>Breathing in, bring your awareness to your legs. Breathing out, allow your legs to relax. Release all the tension in your legs … your thighs …</em>  <a id="page247"/><em>your knees … your calves … your ankles … your feet… your toes … all the tiny muscles in your toes … you may want to move your toes a little to help them relax… send your love and care to your toes.</em></p>
<p class="indent"><em>Bring your awareness back to your breathing… to your abdomen rising and falling.</em></p>
<p class="indent"><em>Following your breathing, become aware of your arms and legs … you may want to move them a little and stretch.</em></p>
<p class="indent"><em>When you feel ready, slowly sit up. When you are ready, slowly stand up.</em></p>
</div>
<p class="nonindent">The above exercises can guide awareness to any part of the body: the hair, brain, ears, neck, lungs, each of the internal organs, the digestive system, or to any part of the body that needs healing and attention. You embrace each part and send it your love, gratitude, and care as you hold it in your awareness and breathe in and out.</p>
