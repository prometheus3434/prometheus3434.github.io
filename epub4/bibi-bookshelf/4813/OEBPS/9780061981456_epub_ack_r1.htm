<p class="nonindent"><em>Savor: Mindful Eating, Mindful Life</em> has come to be because the conditions are right. This book would not be possible without the hard work of scientists, humanitarians, health experts, policy makers, spiritual teachers, and practitioners across many generations, and all others known and unknown who have dedicated their lives to making our world a healthier and more compassionate place. Our deepest gratitude to them all.</p>
<p class="indent">We wish to thank Dr. Harvey V. Fineberg for writing the foreword and Dr. Walter Willett for reviewing our book. We would like to express our special appreciation to Sari Kalin, Hank Dart, and Joanne Levy for assisting in the research and the preparation of the manuscript, and our sincere thanks to our loving <em>sanghas</em>, friends, and families for their kind support throughout this journey. Finally, we wish to thank our editor at HarperOne, Gideon Weil, and his associates, for all their help in making this book a reality.</p>
