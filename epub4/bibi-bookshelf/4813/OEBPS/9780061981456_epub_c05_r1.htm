<p class="nonindent">WE HAVE JUST LEARNED that conscious breathing is an essential practice for bringing our body and mind together, nurturing the well-being of the body and mind, and fostering our connection to all things. And just as mindfully breathing air sustains our physical and spiritual life, so, too, does eating food. Not only does food provide the nutrients and energy we need to support our physical bodies; mindful eating can also help us touch the interdependent nature of all things—and can help us end our difficulty with weight.</p>
<p class="indent">Looking deeply at the food we eat, we see that it contains the earth, the air, the rain, the sunshine, and the hard work of farmers and all those who process, transport, and sell us the food. When we eat with full awareness, we become increasingly mindful of all the elements and effort needed to make our meals a reality, and this in turn fosters our appreciation of the constant support we get from others and from nature.  <a id="page98"/>Whenever we eat or drink, we can engage all our senses in the eating and drinking experience. Eating and drinking like this, we not only feed our bodies and safeguard our physical health but also nurture our feelings, our mind, and our consciousness. And we can do this numerous times throughout the day. Mindful eating begins with our choice of what to eat and drink. We want to choose foods and drinks that are good for our health and good for the planet, in the modest portions that will help us control our weight. Yet there are so many types of foods and drinks, and so much information about nutrition and so many diet plans, that we can find it quite difficult to make the right choices. A good way to overcome this challenge is to get up to speed on the latest science-based advice.</p>
<h2 class="section">The Basics of Eating Well: What Nutrients Are in Our Food?</h2>
<p class="nonindent">Food gives the body the raw materials it needs to run the metabolic processes of life. All foods contain at least one, and often two or three, of the so-called macronutrients—carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. These macronutrients give us energy to fuel our daily activities. They also perform unique roles throughout the body. Carbohydrates provide the fastest form of energy, usable by every cell. Proteins provide the building blocks for all of our tissues and organs—skin and muscle, bone and blood, liver and heart. They also form countless cellular mechanisms and minute messengers, such as the enzymes that digest our food and the neurotransmitters that send signals from the brain throughout the body. Fats get woven into the membrane of every cell, insulate nerves, and serve as a precursor to life-sustaining hormones. Food also provides us with vitamins and minerals, the so-called micronutrients—literally, nutrients that are essential in tiny amounts—used to build tissues and catalyze chemical reactions throughout the body.</p>
<p class="indent">Nutrition science of the early twentieth century focused on understanding what macronutrients and micronutrients we need to prevent  <a id="page99"/>diseases of deficiency, such as protein-deficiency kwashiorkor and vitamin D-deficiency rickets. Starting in the mid-twentieth century, nutrition science shifted its focus to complex chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and cancer—illnesses that develop imperceptibly over time, have no easy cure, and end lives prematurely. Thanks to many advances in science, we now know quite a bit about what to eat and drink—and what <em>not</em> to eat and drink—to prevent these chronic diseases. But you do not need to be a scientist to eat well. Nutrients, after all, are found in foods. And you need only follow a few fundamental food guidelines to maintain your health and well-being.</p>
<p class="indent">The dietary recommendations that follow are for adults and are adapted from dietary guidelines developed by experts in the Department of Nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health.<a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn1" id="ch05_fn1a"><sup class="frac">1</sup></a></p>
<h2 class="section">Carbohydrates, Proteins, and Fats: Choosing the Healthiest</h2>
<p class="nonindent">Diet books from Atkins to Zone portray carbohydrates as the enemy. Other nutrition gurus tout low-fat, high-carbohydrate diets to lose weight and prevent disease, or push high-protein diets as the way to achieve good health and a healthy weight. The truth about macronutrients and health, however, is that the <em>type</em> of carbohydrate, protein, and fat we choose is much more important than their relative amounts in our diet.</p>
<p class="indent">Take carbohydrates. They are found in many types of whole and processed foods—from apples to ziti—but not all carbohydrates are created equal. The healthiest carbohydrates come from whole grains, legumes, vegetables, and whole fruits. The least-healthy carbohydrates come from white bread, white rice, pasta and other refined grains, sugary foods and drinks, and potatoes. We talk about the reasons for limiting these less-healthy carbohydrates later in this chapter. Here, let’s focus on the positive: Whole grains, vegetables, whole fruits, and legumes are good choices as carbohydrates, and they are also rich in vitamins, minerals,  <a id="page100"/>and fiber. Whole-grain foods—such as whole-wheat bread, whole oats, brown rice, millet, barley, quinoa, and the like—deserve special mention, because more and more research points to the benefits of making whole grains a daily habit. Long-term studies have found that people who eat, on average, two or three servings of whole-grain foods a day have a 20 to 30 percent lower risk of heart disease and diabetes, compared with people who rarely eat whole grains.<a id="ch05_fn2a"/><a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn2"><sup class="frac">2</sup></a> Eating whole grains may also offer some protection against colon cancer, but more research is needed on this diet-to-disease relationship.<a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn3" id="ch05_fn3a"><sup class="frac">3</sup></a></p>
<div class="box">
<h3 class="section">Why Are Whole Grains So Good for Your Health?</h3>
<p class="indent">Exactly how whole grains protect against heart disease and diabetes is still an open research question. What we do know is that whole grains contain fiber, which slows their digestion and makes for a gentler rise in blood glucose after a meal; the soluble fiber in whole grains, especially the type found in oats, also helps lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL), the “bad” cholesterol. The germ in whole grains provides folate and vitamin E, and whole grains are also a source of magnesium and selenium—vitamins and minerals that may help protect against diabetes, heart disease, and some cancers. Yet some studies have found that the benefits of whole grains go beyond what can be attributed to any individual nutrients that they contain. What seems more likely is that whole grains’ health benefits accrue from their special combination of nutrients.<a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn4" id="ch05_fn4a"><sup class="frac">4</sup></a> The whole is truly greater than the sum of its parts—an aspect of interdependent nature.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">It’s a similar story with proteins. Plant foods or animal foods can all provide the body with the protein it needs. But when choosing foods high in protein, we must pay attention to the other nutrients that travel along with the protein. The healthiest plant sources of protein—beans,  <a id="page101"/>nuts, seeds, whole grains, and foods derived from them—also contain fiber, vitamins, minerals, and healthy fats, and they are earth-friendly selections, too. Among the animal sources of protein, some contain healthful fats (fish) or are relatively low in harmful fats (chicken, eggs). (For more information on choosing healthy fats, see table 5.1 on page 105.) But red meat and full-fat dairy products are high in a type of fat that is bad for our hearts; furthermore, as we discuss later in this chapter, consuming red meat, processed meat, and dairy products may increase the risk of some cancers. Red meat and dairy products also take a terrible toll on the environment. So to pick the healthiest sources of protein, both for your own welfare and for that of the planet, choose plant-based proteins from nuts, legumes, seeds, and beans. If you do have to consume animal foods, choose fish or chicken. If you have to eat red meat, it’s best to limit yourself to no more than once or twice a week. Whole eggs can be a healthful source of protein but should be consumed in moderation, since eating an egg or more a day may increase the risk of diabetes and may increase the risk of heart disease in people who have diabetes;<a id="ch05_fn5a"/><a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn5"><sup class="frac">5</sup></a> if you have heart disease or diabetes, you should eat less than that amount per week.</p>
<div class="box">
<h3 class="section">Vegetarians and Protein:<br/> Variety Is Essential to Good Health</h3>
<p class="indent">There is one difference between plant and animal proteins that is important for us, and especially for vegetarians, to understand. Our body takes the protein in plant and animal foods and breaks it down into smaller components, called amino acids, which it then uses to build and restore tissues and to run a multitude of functions. Some amino acids are “essential,” meaning that the body cannot make them and must obtain them from food. Others are not essential, and the body can build them by rearranging the essential amino acids. Proteins from animal foods are called “complete proteins,” meaning  <a id="page102"/>that they contain all the essential amino acids. Proteins from plant foods are called “incomplete proteins,” meaning that they tend to be low in one or more essential amino acids. Even so, plant proteins can meet your daily protein needs, as long as you choose a variety of plant foods and get enough calories throughout the day. So vegetarians should take care to eat varied high-protein vegetarian foods every day—beans (including tofu), nuts, seeds, and whole grains—to ensure that they get enough of all the essential amino acids.<a id="ch05_fn6a"/><a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn6"><sup class="frac">6</sup></a></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">The same “quality matters more than quantity” message is true about fats. Some fats are so beneficial that you can enjoy them every day, while others are so harmful that you should severely limit them or avoid them altogether. There is an easy way to tell healthy fats from unhealthy fats. Most of the healthy fats—the monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats—come from plants and are liquid at room temperature. Rich green olive oil, golden sunflower oil, the oil that rises to the top of a jar of natural nut butter, and the oils that come from fatty fish are all examples of healthy unsaturated fats. The unhealthy fats—saturated fats—and the <em>very</em> unhealthy fats—trans fats—tend to be solid at room temperature, such as the fat that marbles a steak or that is found in a stick of butter or margarine. Meat and full-fat dairy products are the biggest sources of saturated fat in the Western diet; tropical palm and coconut oils are also high in saturated fat. The trans fat in the Western diet comes primarily from vegetable oils that have been partially hydrogenated, a chemical process that makes oils more solid and stable at room temperature—and makes them extremely harmful to our health.</p>
<p class="indent">What effect do these different types of fats have on our health? Numerous studies have found that when people replace carbohydrates in their diet with monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, their blood-cholesterol profile improves—heart-harmful LDL cholesterol goes down, and protective high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol  <a id="page103"/>goes up.<a id="ch05_fn7a"/><a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn7"><sup class="frac">7</sup></a> Saturated fats, meanwhile, cause both HDL and LDL to rise, so unsaturated fats are a better choice for heart health. Trans fats are the worst kind of fat, harmful in even small amounts.<a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn8" id="ch05_fn8a"><sup class="frac">8</sup></a> They drive down protective HDL and cause a rise in damaging LDL, and they damage the cells that line our arteries. Research also suggests that trans fats trigger inflammation,<a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn9" id="ch05_fn9a"><sup class="frac">9</sup></a> a red alert in our immune system that may underlie a number of deadly diseases, including heart disease, stroke, and possibly diabetes. Diets high in trans fats may promote weight gain,<a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn10" id="ch05_fn10a"><sup class="frac">10</sup></a> although more research is needed into the relationship between trans fats and obesity. Furthermore, eating a low-trans-fat diet that is high in healthy fats may lower the risk of age-related macular degeneration.<a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn11" id="ch05_fn11a"><sup class="frac">11</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Trans fats are getting a bit easier to avoid: since word has gotten out about their ill effects—and since manufacturers have been required to list them on their food labels in the United States—many food manufacturers and restaurants have begun eliminating them from their products. It is nearly impossible to avoid all saturated fats, however, since even healthful sources of unsaturated fats—such as peanuts and olive oil—contain a small amount of saturated fat. So for good health, enjoy healthy fats, limit saturated fat, and avoid trans fat. (See table 5.1.)</p>
<h2 class="section">To Control Your Weight, Calories Matter</h2>
<p class="nonindent">While there is increasing evidence about the best carbohydrate, protein, and fat choices for health, there has been ongoing debate about the best choices for weight loss. Of course, to lose weight, dieters need to eat fewer calories than they burn. The big question has been whether the relative amounts of carbohydrate, protein, and fat in the diet hold any particular advantage for calorie control and weight loss. Some scientists advocate a low-fat diet, while others stand by a lower-carbohydrate approach, or a Mediterranean-style eating plan, with moderate amounts of healthy fats and plenty of fruits, vegetables, and fiber. Two well-designed clinical studies with hundreds of participants that put these competing  <a id="page104"/>diet styles to the test have come up with similar conclusions: people can lose weight using any of these different strategies as long as they lower the amount of calories that they consume; and having social support for making these behavior changes may help them succeed.<a id="ch05_fn16a"/><a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn16"><sup class="frac">16</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">So to achieve a healthier weight, the message is to find a lower-calorie eating plan that you can follow—one that lets you consume healthy foods that you enjoy—and to find some support for following it. Some people may find that support in a formal weight-loss program; some may find it from an online community; some may choose to create that support within their families or circle of friends, joining or starting a mindfulness living <em>sangha</em>, or by working with colleagues to get healthier foods added to the company cafeteria. (To find a mindful living <em>sangha</em> in your area, visit www.iamhome.org.)</p>
<p class="indent">You may be wondering how many calories you should consume each day to maintain your weight and how much to cut back to lose weight. There’s no one answer to that question, since calorie needs vary depending on age, gender, body size, and level of physical activity. Some people may need only 2,000 to 2,500 calories per day to maintain their weight, and a bit less to lose weight, while others who have a larger body size or are very active may be able to eat more calories yet still lose weight. As people lose weight, their daily calorie needs drop. There are many Web sites that offer calorie-need calculators based on your current weight and your weight goals, and consulting a health professional, especially a registered dietitian, about your calorie needs is also useful. As a practical guide, an energy deficit of about 250 to 500 calories per day can result in two to four pounds of weight loss per month, and a safe approach to creating this energy imbalance is to moderately reduce one’s calorie intake and increase one’s activity. This amounts to cutting back on sugary soda by about a can a day and adding a brisk walk daily. (See chapter 6 for more advice on physical activity and weight loss.)</p>

<p class="nonindent"><sup class="frac">*</sup><span class="small">Coconut oil is less harmful than other forms of saturated fat, since it raises HD (“good” cholesterol), so it is fi ne to include a small amount of coconut oil in your diet.</span></p>
<p class="nonindent"><sup class="frac">**</sup><span class="small">Margarine can be a healthful fat choice as long as it contains no trans fats and no partially hydrogenated oils, so check the nutrition-facts label for zero trans fats, and check the ingredients list to make sure the margarine contains no partially hydrogenated oil.</span></p>

<h3 class="section"> <a id="page106"/>Omega-3s—An Especially Healthy Fat</h3>
<p class="indent">When you choose your healthy fats, make a special effort to include omega-3 fats, polyunsaturated fats that are extremely beneficial for the heart. Omega-3 fats appear to protect against erratic heart rhythms that may cause sudden death.<a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn12" id="ch05_fn12a"><sup class="frac">12</sup></a> They may also hold benefits for people suffering from inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis.<a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn13" id="ch05_fn13a"><sup class="frac">13</sup></a> Omega-3 fats are essential fats, meaning that our bodies cannot manufacture them and we must obtain them from food or supplements. So it’s a good idea to enjoy at least one omega-3-rich food every day.</p>
<p class="indent">An earth-friendly source of omega-3s are the plant foods that contain alpha linolenic acid (ALA)—principally, walnuts, canola and soybean oils, flaxseeds and flaxseed oil, dark leafy greens, and chia seeds (also known as salvia). For those who consume fish, fatty fish—such as salmon, tuna, bluefish, and mackerel—are rich in two types of omega-3 fats, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), also known as long-chain omega-3 fats. Much of the research on omega-3s and heart disease has focused on consumption of fish or fish-oil supplements.<a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn14" id="ch05_fn14a"><sup class="frac">14</sup></a> Our body can convert the plant form of omega-3 into the long-chain form, but it does so slowly, and there has been much scientific debate over whether these different forms of omega-3 fats work the same beneficial way in the body. Vegetarians, however, can take heart: newer research shows that plant omega-3s may also play an important role in protecting the heart, especially in people who do not regularly eat fish.<a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn15" id="ch05_fn15a"><sup class="frac">15</sup></a></p>

<h2 class="section"><a id="page107"/>Eat and Drink for Your Health and Our World: Practical Guides</h2>
<p class="nonindent">Beyond the technical words like <em>carbohydrates, proteins</em>, and <em>fats</em>, there are a few practical guidelines to follow that will steer your eating habits in a healthier direction to control weight and help you lower your risk of diseases.</p>
<h3 class="section">Go with Plants</h3>
<p class="nonindent">A mindful diet for weight loss should first and foremost be a healthy diet—both for you and for the planet. And the first and most essential principle of healthy eating is to shift more to a plant-based diet. Asians in particular have practiced vegetarianism for thousands of years. As we discussed in chapter 3, the ethical and environmental arguments for a plant-based diet are stronger than ever. The health benefits for eating a plant-based diet are equally strong.</p>
<p class="indent">Decades of research on hundreds of thousands of men and women has shown that eating a diet rich in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and healthy fats and low in refined grains and unhealthy fats can lower the risk of heart disease and diabetes.<a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn17" id="ch05_fn17a"><sup class="frac">17</sup></a> Some research even suggests that people who eat little or no meat may live longer than people who follow a more meat-heavy diet<a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn18" id="ch05_fn18a"><sup class="frac">18</sup></a> (although the science isn’t definitive and not all studies have found such a mortality benefit<a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn19" id="ch05_fn19a"><sup class="frac">19</sup></a>). Vegetarians and vegans tend to weigh less and have lower blood pressure, lower blood cholesterol, and, in turn, a lowered risk of heart disease than people whose diets include some or all types of animal products;<a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn20" id="ch05_fn20a"><sup class="frac">20</sup></a> they may also have lower risks of some cancers, though the studies are conflicting and more research is needed.<a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn21" id="ch05_fn21a"><sup class="frac">21</sup></a> (Of course, for optimum health, vegans must take care to get adequate vitamin B<sub class="frac">12</sub>, vitamin D, and other nutrients they may be missing by avoiding animal foods.)<a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn22" id="ch05_fn22a"><sup class="frac">22</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">There’s also strong evidence of the health hazards associated with eating animal foods. The Center for Science in the Public Interest estimates that the saturated fat and cholesterol in red meat, poultry, dairy  <a id="page108"/>products, and eggs cause sixty-three thousand heart-disease-related deaths a year in the United States and another eleven hundred deaths a year from food poisoning.<a id="ch05_fn23a"/><a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn23"><sup class="frac">23</sup></a> People who eat meat and processed meat have a higher risk of diabetes than individuals who follow a vegetarian diet.<a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn24" id="ch05_fn24a"><sup class="frac">24</sup></a> High levels of red-meat consumption, and any level of processed-meat consumption, raises the risk of colon cancer,<a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn25" id="ch05_fn25a"><sup class="frac">25</sup></a> and eating meat, especially meat that is cooked to a high temperature, may increase the risk of pancreatic cancer.<a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn26" id="ch05_fn26a"><sup class="frac">26</sup></a> The Nurse’s Health Study II, meanwhile, followed nearly forty thousand women for seven years to determine the relationship between red-meat consumption and the risk of getting early breast cancer. It found that for every additional 3.5 ounces of red meat consumed per day—a portion of meat about the size of a medium fast-food hamburger—the risk of premenopausal breast cancer rose by 20 percent.<a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn27" id="ch05_fn27a"><sup class="frac">27</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">You do not need to become a 100 percent vegetarian to achieve the health benefits of a plant-based diet. Several studies have shown that following a “prudent” diet pattern—one that is rich in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and healthy fats but does include fish and poultry—rather than a meat-heavy diet may lower the risk of several deadly and disabling diseases, among them diabetes,<a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn28" id="ch05_fn28a"><sup class="frac">28</sup></a> heart disease,<a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn29" id="ch05_fn29a"><sup class="frac">29</sup></a> stroke,<a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn30" id="ch05_fn30a"><sup class="frac">30</sup></a> and obstructive lung disease,<a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn31" id="ch05_fn31a"><sup class="frac">31</sup></a> as well as lower the risk of dying from heart disease, cancer, or any other cause.<a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn32" id="ch05_fn32a"><sup class="frac">32</sup></a> A similar line of research has found evidence that following a Mediterranean-style diet pattern, which is also plant based but includes dairy and fish, can lower the risk of heart disease, stroke, Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease, and cancer, as well as the risk of dying from heart disease, cancer, or any other cause.<a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn33" id="ch05_fn33a"><sup class="frac">33</sup></a> So you can benefit from becoming even a part-time vegetarian.</p>
<h3 class="section">Fill Your Plate with Vegetables of All Different Colors—And Enjoy Your Fruits Whole</h3>
<p class="nonindent">When it comes to vegetables and fruits, the basic message comes down to two words: eat more. People who eat diets rich in vegetables and whole fruits may lower their blood pressure as well as their risk of heart  <a id="page109"/>disease, stroke, diabetes, and possibly some cancers.<a id="ch05_fn34a"/><a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn34"><sup class="frac">34</sup></a> Diets rich in vegetables and fruits may lower your risk of cataracts and macular degeneration,<a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn35" id="ch05_fn35a"><sup class="frac">35</sup></a> and thus help protect your vision as you age.</p>
<p class="indent">The benefits of eating whole fruits and vegetables likely accrue from the nutrients that they provide, as well as from the absence of less-healthy or higher-calorie foods, which they may replace on your plate. Fruits and vegetables are loaded with vitamins, such as vitamin C, which gives a boost to the immune system and also acts as a powerful antioxidant, preventing cellular damage from free radicals; vitamin K for strong bones; and beta-carotene, a precursor to vitamin A and also an antioxidant. They are rich in minerals, including potassium, which may help lower blood pressure, and magnesium, which may help control blood glucose. They are also a great source of healthy carbohydrates, including fiber. Special plant chemicals, also known as phytochemicals, that give vegetables and fruits their bright colors may also play beneficial roles in protecting against disease. Lycopene, for example, a pigment that helps make tomatoes and watermelon such a vibrant red, may protect against prostate cancer. Lutein and zeaxanthin, other members of the carotenoid family, may help prevent age-related macular degeneration.</p>
<p class="indent">To get the benefit of all these protective nutrients, make an effort to choose vegetables and fruits in a rainbow of colors every day. Include dark green varieties, such as broccoli, kale, Brussels sprouts, and collard greens; yellow-orange, such as sweet potato and apricots, carrots and cantaloupe; red, such as tomatoes, watermelon, strawberries, and red bell peppers; white, such as onions, garlic, and cauliflower; and purple-blue, such as red cabbage, beets, and blueberries. Make it your goal to consume at least five servings of vegetables and fruits a day, since several studies find that the heart-healthy benefits of vegetables and fruits begin to accrue at this level.<a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn36" id="ch05_fn36a"><sup class="frac">36</sup></a> More is certainly better. A serving is about half a cup of cooked vegetables or chopped fruit, or one cup of salad greens. To make it easier to gauge the portion, devote half of your plate to vegetables or fruits at each meal.</p>
<p class="indent"> <a id="page110"/>Remember to enjoy your fruit whole, not drunk as a big glass of juice. Fruit juice—even 100 percent fruit juice—is high in rapidly digested sugar. A glass of orange juice has as much sugar and calories as a glass of Coca-Cola. Fruit juice also lacks the fiber of whole fruit. Indeed, the Nurses’ Health Study found that women who drank a cup or more of fruit juice per day had a 40 to 50 percent higher risk of diabetes than women who drank fruit juice less than once a month. Eating whole fruit, however, was associated with a lower risk of diabetes.<a id="ch05_fn37a"/><a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn37"><sup class="frac">37</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">To extend the benefits of fruits and vegetables beyond your own health, buy your fruits and vegetables from a local farmers’ market, or buy a share in a community-supported farm. You’ll be supporting your local economy, you’ll enjoy fruits and vegetables at the peak of their freshness, and your produce will consume fewer fossil fuels on its way from the farm to your plate. (See the appendix for information about how to find community-supported farms.)</p>
<h3 class="section">Limit Potatoes, Refined Grains, and Sweets</h3>
<p class="nonindent">You may notice one vegetable that is conspicuously absent from the list of rainbow-colored vegetables: the potato. While multiple studies have shown the benefits of eating fruits and vegetables, potatoes do not seem to play a role in these observed protective effects. That’s because potatoes—whether their skins are brown, red, yellow, or purple—have more in common with white bread and white rice than they do with broccoli or bell peppers. Potatoes contain rapidly digested starch, and large amounts of it.</p>
<p class="indent">Eating a large portion of such starchy foods can send your blood sugar on a roller coaster. First, as your body quickly converts the starch to glucose and absorbs the glucose from the gut, blood-sugar levels rise high; your pancreas pumps out insulin to rapidly clear the glucose from the blood, but it may overshoot things a bit, causing your blood sugar to dip a bit lower. This sequence of events may lead you to feel hungry again, not long after finishing your meal. Over time, eating diets high  <a id="page111"/>in such rapidly digested starchy foods may increase your risk of heart disease and diabetes,<a id="ch05_fn38a"/><a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn38"><sup class="frac">38</sup></a> and there is evidence that limiting these types of foods in your diet may help with weight loss.<a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn39" id="ch05_fn39a"><sup class="frac">39</sup></a> So eat potatoes sparingly, if at all, and when you do, don’t count them as part of your five-plus servings of vegetables a day.</p>
<p class="indent">Eating large amounts of refined grains and sweets, similar to eating lots of potatoes, can cause a rapid rise in blood sugar, a spike in insulin, and then an equally precipitous dip in blood glucose. Furthermore, the refined grains that fill our supermarket shelves—white rice, white bread, white pasta, and anything made with white flour—are nutritionally bankrupt substitutes for whole grains. The grain-refining process removes the bran and the germ, taking away nearly all of the fiber and many of the beneficial vitamins and minerals. What’s left is the starchy middle, or endosperm. Food manufacturers must, by law, add back some of the lost nutrients to refined grains, but they do not replace everything that has been stripped away.</p>
<p class="indent">The American Heart Association (AHA) has recommended that Americans drastically cut back on added sugar, to help slow the obesity and heart disease epidemics.<a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn40" id="ch05_fn40a"><sup class="frac">40</sup></a> The AHA’s suggested added sugar threshold is no more than 100 calories per day (about 6 teaspoons or 24 grams of sugar) for most women and no more than 150 calories per day (about 9 teaspoons or 36 grams of sugar) for most men. Keep in mind, however, that your body doesn’t need to get any carbohydrate from added sugar. A good rule of thumb is to skip products that have added sugar at or near the top of the list, or have several sources of added sugar sprinkled throughout the list.</p>
<h3 class="section">Take a Daily Multivitamin with Extra D to Give You a Nutritional Safety Net</h3>
<p class="nonindent">If you live in the higher latitudes, spend a lot of time indoors, have a dark skin tone, or are overweight or obese, you may be deficient in vitamin D without even realizing it. Vegans and others who mindfully limit their intake of animal products may also be deficient in some nutrients,  <a id="page112"/>such as vitamin B<sub class="frac">12</sub>. That’s why nutrition experts at the Harvard School of Public Health recommend that adults take a daily multivitamin as “nutrition insurance.”</p>
<p class="indent">There’s no need to buy a fancy supplement. Even a standard store-brand supplement will have enough of the basic vitamins and minerals that you need. There’s also no need to take a supplement that provides more than 100 percent of the daily value of any vitamin or mineral, with the exception of vitamin D, a nutrient that is critical for bone health and that scientists believe may also play a role in preventing chronic diseases such as heart disease, some cancers, infectious diseases, and multiple sclerosis.<a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn41" id="ch05_fn41a"><sup class="frac">41</sup></a> One billion people worldwide are thought to be deficient in vitamin D, and scientists now think that our daily vitamin D needs are much higher than once thought.<a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn42" id="ch05_fn42a"><sup class="frac">42</sup></a> Few foods are naturally rich in vitamin D, and even foods that are fortified with vitamin D (such as milk in the United States) do not provide much of it. Furthermore, during the winter months, the bodies of people who live in higher latitudes can’t make enough vitamin D from exposure to the sun. That’s why many people may benefit from taking 1,000 to 2,000 international units (IUs) of supplemental vitamin D a day. Since a standard multivitamin typically provides only 400 IUs, you may want to ask your doctor to evaluate whether you need a vitamin D supplement in addition to your multivitamin.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, be sure to look for a multivitamin that derives most if not all of its vitamin A from beta-carotene rather than from retinol. Consuming high levels of retinol may increase the risk of fractures; pregnant women should also avoid taking high levels of retinol, as this may lead to birth defects.<a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn43" id="ch05_fn43a"><sup class="frac">43</sup></a></p>
<h3 class="section">Limit Sodium</h3>
<p class="nonindent">Sodium is an essential nutrient, but most of us get far more of it each day than we need. High-sodium diets can exacerbate high blood pressure in some individuals. Reducing sodium can lower blood pressure  <a id="page113"/>and, over the long term, can also lower the risk of heart attack and other cardiac problems.<a id="ch05_fn44a"/><a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn44"><sup class="frac">44</sup></a> It’s best to limit sodium to less than 2,300 milligrams per day—the amount found in about one teaspoon of table salt. People who have high blood pressure or are at risk of high blood pressure (including people over the age of forty, African Americans, or people who have prehypertension) should cut back further, to no more than 1,500 milligrams per day. Indeed, the AHA now recommends that most adults cut back to 1,500 milligrams of sodium per day, since new research estimates that 70 percent of U.S. adults fall into this high-risk, salt-sensitive group.<a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn45" id="ch05_fn45a"><sup class="frac">45</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">One way to reduce the sodium in your diet is to cut back on processed foods. Food manufacturers add loads of sodium to frozen meals, soups, condiments, cheese, bread, and chips to cater to our taste for saltiness, but also to improve texture and extend shelf life. Fast-food and sit-down restaurants also offer exceptionally salty fare; the Center for Science in the Public Interest, for example, has found that some U.S. restaurant appetizers and entrées contain more than a day’s worth of sodium.<a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn46" id="ch05_fn46a"><sup class="frac">46</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Cutting back on processed and restaurant foods may also help you limit the amount of another high-sodium food additive, the flavor-enhancing monosodium glutamate (MSG)—and emerging research suggests MSG consumption may be related to weight. A small study in China found that people who had the highest MSG intake were nearly three times as likely to be overweight as people who had the lowest MSG intake.<a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn47" id="ch05_fn47a"><sup class="frac">47</sup></a> The findings are preliminary, and researchers have yet to tease out the way that MSG may be related to weight. It’s possible that the enhanced flavor of MSG-laced food spurs people to simply eat more of it; it’s also possible that MSG has an effect on the brain centers or hormones that control hunger.<a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn48" id="ch05_fn48a"><sup class="frac">48</sup></a></p>
<h3 class="section">Get Enough Calcium—But Consider the Source</h3>
<p class="nonindent">Calcium—the mineral that is essential for strong bones and teeth, the steady beating of the heart, and countless other bodily functions—has  <a id="page114"/>been the focus of much scientific debate. The U.S. government recommends that we consume 1,000 milligrams of calcium per day, while the United Kingdom recommends only 700 milligrams per day. Some critics speculate that the U.S. recommendations are shaped more by the lobbying of the powerful dairy industry than they are by the scientific evidence.<a id="ch05_fn49a"/><a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn49"><sup class="frac">49</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">There’s also been debate about how best to get calcium. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Agriculture’s Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends that adults consume three glasses of milk a day. Yet milk and dairy foods are high in unhealthy saturated fat. Even fat-free milk has about eighty calories per glass, and three glasses can really bust the calorie budget of someone trying to lose weight.</p>
<p class="indent">This debate over milk gets even more complicated when one considers the relationship between dairy, calcium, and chronic disease. Dairy consumption can protect against colon cancer in modest amounts;<a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn50" id="ch05_fn50a"><sup class="frac">50</sup></a> high levels of dairy intake on their own, however, do not seem to offer protection against fractures late in life.<a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn51" id="ch05_fn51a"><sup class="frac">51</sup></a> If there were no harm in consuming high amounts of dairy and calcium, this would be purely an academic debate. But studies raise the disturbing possibility that high levels of milk or calcium intake are associated with increased risk of prostate cancer in men and that high levels of lactose intake are associated with increased risk of ovarian cancer in women.<a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn52" id="ch05_fn52a"><sup class="frac">52</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Milk production also has a huge environmental impact, as we described in chapter 3. And there is an ethical implication of drinking milk, since the treatment of cows on dairy farms is often not very compassionate and cows who can no longer produce milk are then slaughtered. The dairy and beef industries are closely linked, so even if you do not consume the meat of cows or wear leather made from them, someone else does.</p>
<p class="indent">So what is the best way to get calcium? If you plan your diet carefully, you can get enough calcium from nondairy sources—among them, leafy green vegetables, calcium-set tofu, and tahini. For some people who  <a id="page115"/>eat a vegan diet, however, they may want to consider taking calcium supplements or making sure to consume calcium-fortified soy, grain, or nut-milk beverages, a small glass of calcium-fortified juice, or calcium-fortified cold cereals. If you do want to consume dairy products, having a modest amount—no more than one or two servings per day—and eating a healthy diet rich in vegetables and legumes can also provide adequate calcium. An additional benefit of taking calcium supplements is that they are often fortified with vitamin D, which helps calcium absorption.</p>
<h3 class="section">Choose Healthy Drinks</h3>
<p class="nonindent">Water is the best drink choice for health and weight loss. Sugary drinks are the worst choice, since consuming them in excess contributes to the risk of obesity, diabetes, and possibly even heart disease.<a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn53" id="ch05_fn53a"><sup class="frac">53</sup></a> Sometimes, however, it is not that obvious that a beverage is high in sugar and calories. If you mindfully read the nutrition-facts label, you will see that natural “100 percent fruit juice” has as many calories and as much sugar as a soda. Grape juice and cranberry juice cocktails have <em>more</em> sugar and calories than a soda. If you enjoy juice, stick to one small glass a day, about the size of an old-fashioned “juice glass” (4 to 6 ounces). Energy drinks and sports drinks also contain lots of sugar, though drink marketers often try to disguise these beverages as “healthy” by boasting about the vitamins, electrolytes, antioxidants, or herbs they contain. Don’t be fooled. Keep in mind that there are many different types of sugar added to drinks—cane sugar, honey, high-fructose corn syrup, fruit-juice concentrates—but to the body, they are all sources of extra calories and sugar. Diet drinks, sweetened with artificial sweeteners, may not be the best alternative, since it is unclear what their long-term effects are on weight and health.</p>
<p class="indent">The Department of Nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health has developed a “traffic-light” system for ranking beverages (see figure 5.1).<a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn54" id="ch05_fn54a"><sup class="frac">54</sup></a> Those highest in sugar—sugary sodas, fruit juices, smoothies, and sports drinks—fall into the “red” category: “drink sparingly and in-frequently,  <a id="page116"/>if at all.” Slightly sweet beverages—those that have no more than one gram of sugar per ounce and are free of artificial sweeteners—fall into the “yellow” category: “a better choice, but don’t overdo it.” The “green” beverages are your best bet—beverages that are sugar-free naturally, such as water or sparkling water. Tea or coffee can be a healthy choice for most people, in moderation (up to three or four cups a day) and may even have some health benefits.<a id="ch05_fn55a"/><a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn55"><sup class="frac">55</sup></a> Skip the sugar and cream to keep these beverages low-calorie and healthful. Pregnant women may want to limit their caffeine. People who get jittery or have sleep problems when they consume caffeine may also want to limit caffeine.</p>

<h3 class="section">Be Mindful of Alcohol Consumption</h3>
<p class="nonindent">From a health perspective, alcohol should be limited, if you consume it at all. Heavy drinking increases the risk of chronic diseases such as hypertension; cirrhosis; esophageal, breast and colon cancers; and alcoholism.<a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn56" id="ch05_fn56a"><sup class="frac">56</sup></a> Alcoholism also takes a tremendous toll on families,  <a id="page117"/>communities, and nations. Worldwide, alcohol consumption has been estimated to cause one in twenty-five deaths, and the cost of alcohol to society—an estimated 1 percent of gross domestic product in high-and middle-income countries—includes the cost of both alcohol-fueled chronic diseases and alcohol-related social problems.<a id="ch05_fn57a"/><a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn57"><sup class="frac">57</sup></a> Although moderate drinking can lower the risk of heart disease and diabetes,<a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn58" id="ch05_fn58a"><sup class="frac">58</sup></a> it can also raise the risk of breast cancer and colon cancer.<a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn59" id="ch05_fn59a"><sup class="frac">59</sup></a> If you do not drink, there’s no reason to start drinking, since there are many other ways to improve your heart health and lower your risk of diabetes. (Skipping sugary drinks is one way; exercising more is another.)</p>
<p class="indent">Scientifically, moderate drinking is defined as no more than one drink per day for women and no more than two drinks per day for men, and until middle age, the risks outweigh the benefits.<a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn60" id="ch05_fn60a"><sup class="frac">60</sup></a> Yet even drinking in moderation can be the beginning of alcoholism for some people. Although you yourself may always be on guard about not becoming addicted to alcohol and can safely drink a glass of wine occasionally without overindulging, this may not be the case for your children, your grandchildren, and other loved ones. Every time you drink in front of them, you may be increasing the likelihood that they will drink in the future. And they may grow up and become dependent on alcohol. By abstaining from alcohol completely, you become a role model for them and may help to protect them from turning to alcohol as a habit or in times of stress and difficulty. Alcohol is an addictive substance.<a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn61" id="ch05_fn61a"><sup class="frac">61</sup></a> Having the first glass may lead to the second and the third. When you see that as a society, we are in great danger because of how we use alcohol, refraining from the first glass of wine is a manifestation of your enlightenment. You do it for all of us.</p>
<p class="indent">We must look deeply to see that when we practice mindful consumption we practice not only for ourselves but for others. The way you live your life is for your ancestors, future generations, and your whole society. Even if we completely refrain from all drinking, we can still get killed by a drunk driver, so to help one person stop drinking is to make  <a id="page118"/>the world safer for everyone. When we can be free from the shell of our small self and see our interrelatedness to everyone and everything, we understand that our every act is linked with all of humanity, with the whole cosmos. To stay healthy is to be kind to your ancestors, your parents, future generations, and also your society.</p>
<p class="indent">From the standpoint of mindfulness and compassion, we encourage you to abstain from alcohol. As in the case of meat consumption, reducing alcohol consumption can impact world hunger, as the grains and foods used in alcohol production can be used instead for direct human consumption. If you are unable to completely stop drinking, then at least reduce the amount you drink by one-third, one-half, or two-thirds. No one can practice perfectly, including the Buddha. Even vegetarian dishes are not entirely vegetarian. Boiling vegetables kills the bacteria living in them. Although we cannot be perfect, because of the real danger alcoholism poses to our society, destroying many families and causing much suffering, we should practice to reduce or completely stop our alcohol consumption. We have to live in a way that will avoid the tragedy alcohol abuse can create. This is why even if you can be very healthy while enjoying one glass of wine every week, we still urge you to look deeply into the detrimental effects of alcohol on our society and do the best you can to minimize alcohol consumption. Whenever you drink alcohol, ask yourself: Do I really want to drink this? And if you are going to drink, drink mindfully.</p>
<h2 class="section">The Practice of Mindful Eating</h2>
<p class="nonindent">Now that we’ve covered the basics of healthy eating, let’s focus on how to eat mindfully so that we truly enjoy our food and eat with compassion and understanding. Mindful eating means simply eating or drinking while being aware of each bite or sip. You can practice it at any meal, whether you are alone in your kitchen or with others in a crowded restaurant. You can even practice mindful drinking when you pause to take a sip of water at your desk. Mindful eating allows us to fully appreciate  <a id="page119"/>the sensory delight of eating and to be more conscious of the amount and nature of all that we eat and drink. When practiced to its fullest, mindful eating turns a simple meal into a spiritual experience, giving us a deep appreciation of all that went into the meal’s creation as well a deep understanding of the relationship between the food on our table, our own health, and our planet’s health.</p>
<p class="indent">Engaging in mindful eating, even if only for a few minutes, can help you recognize how the practice of mindfulness encompasses all spheres and activities, including ordinary tasks. Take drinking a glass of water: if we are fully aware that we are drinking the water, and we are not thinking of anything else, we are drinking with our whole body and mind. While eating, we can also be aware of how we feel and of how we consume, whether we are truly hungry, and whether we are making the best choices for our health and the health of the planet.</p>
<p class="indent">Mindful eating sees each meal as representative of the whole cosmos. Recall the apple meditation from chapter 2. Look closely at an apple and you can see a cloud floating in it, as well as the rain, the earth, and the sunshine that made the apple tree flower and fruit. Recognize that this apple contains the universe. When you bite into the apple, can you be fully aware that this is a miracle from the universe that you have just put into your mouth? Notice that there is nothing else in your mouth as you chew, no worries or anxiety. When you chew the apple, just chew the apple, not your future plans or anger. You must chew very consciously and with focus. When you are able to be there for the apple 100 percent, you will feel connected to the earth, to the farmer who grew the apple, and also to the person who brought it to your table. Eating this way, you feel that strength, freedom, and pleasure are attainable. This meal nourished not only your body but also your mind—your whole being. Let’s see how a mindful chef would apply these practices in the kitchen and at the dinner table.</p>
<h3 class="section"><a id="page120"/>Chef Sati Invites You to Dinner</h3>
<p class="nonindent">Chef Sati—a chef and Buddhist teacher—invited us to dinner to introduce us to the art of mindful cooking and eating. He promised that his dishes would enlighten our senses and that the evening would simply be an opportunity to touch the joy of life, but we would all have to take an active part in the meal.</p>
<p class="indent">He placed an array of colorful vegetables, whole grains, and spices on the counter. As we washed the vegetables, he said, “In these vegetables, I see the sun, the earth, the clouds, the rain, and numerous other phenomena, including the hard work of the farmers. These fresh vegetables are gifts of the universe. Washing them, we know we are also washing the sun, the earth, the sky, and the farmers.” Because we were attentive to what we were doing, we touched the interdependent nature that makes life possible and felt deep joy to be living in the present moment.</p>
<p class="indent">The host made a wonderful soup with mushrooms; a salad bursting with red, yellow, orange, burgundy, and green colors; oven-fresh whole-grain bread with nuts; and, along with other dishes, what appeared to be a chicken dish with a wonderful sauce, decorated with green onions and cilantro. The kitchen was filled with brilliant colors and fine textures of various ingredients, aroma from different herbs and spices, sizzling and bubbling music from the stove—all leading to the mouthwatering dishes that were masterfully prepared. All of our senses came alive. Working together, we prepared all the dishes in no time at all.</p>
<p class="indent">As we sat down around the dinner table, we looked at the empty plates in front of us that we were eager to fill with the scrumptious food that Chef Sati had assembled in the middle of the table. He gently exclaimed, “It’s so wonderful for us to be together, and I am so grateful we can share this dinner because in many other parts of the world, our empty plates might remain empty for a long time. Eating is a very deep practice. Let’s learn to eat with compassion and understanding.” There was plenty of food on the table, but he suggested that we start by taking only a small portion first. Following his cues, before we served ourselves  <a id="page121"/>we smiled at each other, looked at the food, and smiled to it with gratitude. When we picked up our piece of bread, we did not devour it immediately. Behind the tenderness and the inviting aroma of the bread, we tried to look deeply into it—to see the sunshine inside, the cloud inside, the earth inside. We saw also all past generations of wheat plants leading up to the wheat of our times, as well as all the many generations of farmers and scientists who contributed to the evolution of the wheat and bread industry. The bread carried a lot of love and care of many people, including our dinner host. When we had seen clearly the real piece of bread, we put it into our mouth and chewed it mindfully—chewing and tasting only the bread, and not the worries in our minds. This way, we truly enjoyed the bread and could fully receive it as a gift from the universe. The piece of bread in our mouth was a miracle, each of us was a miracle, and the present moment of being together was also a miracle.</p>
<p class="indent">As we slowly ate the bread, soup, salad, and other dishes, we became fully aware of each bite, awakening all of our senses. We started to deepen our relationship with the food and to feel how we were all connected in a miraculous way.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing the long history of vegetarianism in Buddhism, we asked our host about the chicken dish. He said, “This may be a surprise to you, but the chicken dish was not prepared with real chicken meat. It is made with soy and wheat gluten, by infusing the glutinous protein with spices and sauces to simulate the flavor and texture of chicken. I included this dish to ensure there would be enough protein in the meal.” The dish was indeed as flavorful as it looked. He further explained, “I don’t use real chicken meat or any other kinds of meats or animal products in cooking because it harms the environment and is not compassionate toward animals.” The wholesomeness of the chicken dish was truly amazing, and we enjoyed every bite of it. We felt fortunate that we could sit down and enjoy a meal like this, being so present to the food and our friends.</p>
<p class="indent">After we finished our meal and had all commented on how good it felt to eat in this peaceful, mindful way, our host unabashedly asked us to  <a id="page122"/>help wash the dishes. We knew, of course, that there was another valuable mindfulness experience coming. The idea of doing the dishes was not exactly fun. But once he stood in front of the sink and tenderly and joyfully cleaned the plates with as much care as he had cooked all the wonderful dishes, we rolled up our sleeves and took turns washing as well. He explained that we needed to be mindful of everything we did, including the most mundane of chores such as dishwashing. We should be fully aware of the plates, the water, the amount of detergent, and each hand movement with the sponge. We could wash each dish with the same care that we would use if we were bathing a baby. We had to pay full attention to the task. Any distraction that disengaged us from the dishes would take us away from experiencing the present moment, a valuable moment in which we and the dishes are related. Sounding like a light breeze, he offered, “We should do the dishes just to do the dishes. We should live fully in the moment while washing them, not think about dessert or about going home. Otherwise, we miss an important appointment with life.”</p>
<p class="indent">After we cheerfully finished putting away the dishes, we made a light, fragrant tea to accompany our dessert, which was a composition of fresh green, yellow, and red melons carefully cut in triangular wedges and presented beautifully on each plate. Chef Sati showed us how to drink tea. He held a cup of tea in his hands, breathed in the fragrance consciously a few times, and said, “Conscious breathing will bring the body and mind together. When the mind and body become one, we feel solid and become fully present for the tea. As we drink our tea, we should be completely aware that we are drinking the tea. When we truly meet the tea in the present moment, we feel alive. Only then are we really living our life.” After a few attentive sips, we all experienced that drinking tea had become the most important thing at that moment. The light green tea and delicious melons complemented each other perfectly.</p>
<p class="indent">As we relaxed into the evening, we felt nourished—not only physically, but also spiritually. We did not feel stuffed but rather perfectly satisfied, content, fortunate, and peaceful.</p>
<h3 class="section"><a id="page123"/>Eating Mindfully Every Day</h3>
<p class="nonindent">We may not all have an opportunity to dine with a Chef Sati, but we should try to follow his valuable example as much as possible.</p>
<p class="indent">At home, reserve a time for dinner. Turn off the TV; put away the newspapers, magazines, mail, and homework. If you are eating with others, work together to help prepare dinner. Each of you can help with washing the vegetables, cooking, or setting the table. When all the food is on the table, sit down and practice conscious breathing a few times to bring your body and mind together, and recover yourselves from a hard day’s work. Be fully present for each other, and for the food in front of you.</p>
<p class="indent">After a few conscious breaths, look at each other with a gentle smile and acknowledge each other’s presence. If you are eating alone, don’t forget to smile to yourself. Breathing and smiling are so easy to do, yet their effects are very powerful in helping us and others to feel at ease. When we look at the food in such a moment of peace, the food becomes real and reveals our connection with it and with everything else. The extent to which we see our interrelationship with the food depends on the depth of our mindfulness practice. We may not always be able to see and taste the whole universe every time we eat, but we can do our best to eat as mindfully as possible.</p>
<p class="indent">When we look at our food on the table, it is helpful to name each dish: “pea soup,” “salad,” and so on. Calling something by its name helps us touch it deeply and see its true nature. And mindfulness reveals to us the presence or absence of toxins in each dish so that we can stop eating something that is not good for us. Children enjoy naming and recognizing foods when we show them how.</p>
<p class="indent">Being with our family and friends to enjoy food is precious. Many people are hungry and without family. When we eat in mindfulness, we generate compassion in our heart for them. With compassion and understanding, we can strengthen our commitment to helping nourish the hungry and lonely people around us. Mindful eating is a good education.  <a id="page124"/>If you practice this way for some time, you will find that you will eat more carefully, and your practice of mindful eating will be an example for others. It is an art to eat in a way that brings mindfulness into our life.</p>
<h2 class="section">The Seven Practices of a Mindful Eater</h2>
<p class="nonindent">One way to incorporate mindfulness into your meals is to simply use the breath. Before eating, make a practice of pausing. Breathe in and out a few times so that you can be one with the food you are about to eat. Mindful eating takes dedicated practice, and there are seven practices that you can develop to help you eat mindfully for good health.</p>
<div class="block1"> 
<p class="hanging3">1. HONOR THE FOOD. Start the meal with the five contemplations, or with whatever traditional grace or prayer you prefer to use to express your gratitude.</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="center"><strong>The Five Contemplations</strong></p>
<p class="hanging">1. This food is the gift of the whole universe: the earth, the sky, numerous living beings, and much hard, loving work.</p>
<p class="hanging">2. May we eat with mindfulness and gratitude so as to be worthy to receive it.</p>
<p class="hanging">3. May we recognize and transform our unwholesome mental formations, especially our greed, and learn to eat with moderation.</p>
<p class="hanging">4. May we keep our compassion alive by eating in such a way that we reduce the suffering of living beings, preserve our planet, and reverse the process of global warming.</p>
<p class="hanging">5. We accept this food so that we may nurture our sisterhood and brotherhood, strengthen our community, and nourish our ideal of serving all living beings.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"> <a id="page125"/>If you are eating with others, steer mealtime conversations toward the food: acknowledge the local farmer who grew your lettuce and tomatoes, thank the person who prepared the salad; or talk about other topics that help nourish your gratitude and connection to your food and each other. Refrain from hashing over work or the latest atrocities in the news. Refrain from arguing. This can help you make sure that you are chewing only your food, not your frustrations. In Vietnam it is a custom to never chastise anyone while they are eating, so as not to disturb their eating and digestion. We can learn from this very commonsense wisdom. Eating in this way, we have the opportunity to sit with people we love and to savor precious food, something that is often scarce for many people in the world.</p>
<p class="indent">At all Plum Village practice centers, we eat our meals in silence during the first twenty minutes of the meal so that we are fully immersed in the experience of eating. We encourage you to experiment with a silent meal at home—even just a silent cup of tea. But you do not need to eat every meal in silence to become a more mindful eater. You can start by simply unplugging from daily distractions during mealtime: turn off the television, the laptop, the cell phone, so there is no watching, no surfing, no texting.</p>
<p class="hanging3">2. ENGAGE ALL SIX SENSES. As you serve and eat your meal, notice the sounds, colors, smells, and textures as well as your mind’s response to them, not just the taste. When you put the first bite of food in your mouth, pause briefly before chewing and notice its taste as though it was the first time you had ever tasted it. With more practice in engaging all of your senses, you may notice that your tastes change, increasing your enjoyment of what you may once have perceived as “boring” health foods.</p>
<p class="hanging3">3. SERVE IN MODEST PORTIONS. Moderation is an essential component of mindful eating. Not only does making a conscious  <a id="page126"/>effort to choose smaller portions help you avoid overeating and weight gain; it is also less wasteful of your household food budget and our planet’s resources. Using a small dinner plate, no larger than nine inches across, and filling it only once can help you eat more moderately.</p>
<p class="hanging3">4. SAVOR SMALL BITES, AND CHEW THOROUGHLY. Consciously choosing smaller bites and chewing them well can help you slow down your meal as well as allow you to fully experience the taste of your food. It can also help improve your digestion, since the process of breaking down our foods begins with enzymes in the mouth. Chew each bite until the food is liquefied in your mouth; that may be twenty to forty times, depending on what you are eating. Chewing well allows your tongue and palate to taste the food better. Once you have swallowed this bite, you will still be able to savor the wonderful taste that the food offers you.</p>
<p class="hanging3">5. EAT SLOWLY TO AVOID OVEREATING. Eating slowly may help you notice when you are feeling pleasantly satisfied so that you can stop before you have eaten too much. There is a difference between feeling that you have had just about enough to eat and feeling as though you have eaten <em>all</em> that you can possibly eat. Mindful eaters practice the former so that they are not overtaxing their bodies—or overtaxing the planet’s resources—by consuming more food than they need. In Chinese medicine, it is recommended to eat only until you are 80 percent full and never to “top off your tummy,” because this weakens the digestive power of your stomach and intestines, putting too much stress on them over the long haul. There is ongoing scientific research on the effects of caloric restriction on longevity, though the results are far from conclusive in humans.<a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn62" id="ch05_fn62a"><sup class="frac">62</sup></a> Of course, avoiding overeating is half of the secret to weight control. (Getting enough activity is the other half, and we discuss this more in chapter 6.)</p>
<p class="indent"> <a id="page127"/>One way to slow down is to consciously put your eating utensils down in between bites. Be aware of your body as you eat. When we eat mindfully, we are relaxed and calm. There is no rush to attend to other tasks; there is no hurry. There is only the present moment. To help you practice this, make sure to allow enough time to enjoy the meal. If your mealtime is short—for example, during your lunch break at work—plan on a smaller meal rather than cramming down a large meal quickly.</p>
<p class="hanging3">6. DON’T SKIP MEALS. Skipping meals can make it harder to make mindful choices. When hunger consumes us, the strong forces of habit energy may lead us to grab whatever foods are close at hand—be they from a vending machine or a fast-food restaurant—and these foods may not further our healthy-eating or weight-loss goals. So-called <em>grazing</em>—moving from one food to another, a few bites of this, a few bites of that, without ever sitting down to a regular meal—can also work against your healthy-weight goals, because you may consume more food than you realize without ever feeling truly satisfied. So give yourself the opportunity to make mindful choices throughout the day; plan regular meals and, if it suits you, healthy snacks in between. It is also good to eat your meals at the same time each day, to help your body settle into a consistent rhythm. And give yourself enough time to fully savor your food so that you are aware of all the sensory delights your meals have to offer.</p>
<p class="hanging3">7. EAT A PLANT-BASED DIET, FOR YOUR HEALTH AND FOR THE PLANET. When mindful eaters look deeply at the meal they are about to eat, they see far beyond the rim of the plate. They see the dangerous toll that eating some types of animal foods can take on their bodies—the higher risks of colon cancer from red meat and processed meats, for example, or the higher risk of heart disease from the saturated fat found in meat and dairy products. And they see the equally dangerous and destructive  <a id="page128"/>toll that meat production and dairy farming take on our environment. Researchers at the University of Chicago estimate that, when it’s all added up, the average American could do more to reduce global warming emissions by going vegetarian than by switching from a Camry to a Prius.<a id="ch05_fn63a"/><a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn63"><sup class="frac">63</sup></a> Even just switching from red meat and dairy to poultry or eggs for one day a week could have a measurable impact on global warming—and a bigger environmental impact than choosing locally sourced foods.<a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn64" id="ch05_fn64a"><sup class="frac">64</sup></a></p>
</div>
<h2 class="section">Watch Out for Mindless Traps</h2>
<p class="nonindent">We have talked about what to eat and how to enjoy our meals. We all would like to eat healthfully, but we also have our own internal knots, the strong habit energies that distract us from practicing mindfulness. People are more likely to eat healthfully if they believe that they are capable of doing so; if they believe doing so will have health benefits; if they have support from family and friends; and if healthy eating is the norm for most of their family members or coworkers.<a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn65" id="ch05_fn65a"><sup class="frac">65</sup></a> People are also more likely to eat well if their community or workplace makes it easier to do so—if, for example, they live near supermarkets or if their worksite cafeterias and vending machines offer healthy foods.<a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn66" id="ch05_fn66a"><sup class="frac">66</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Likewise, barriers to healthy eating can exist within the person or within the environment the person is immersed in. Not wanting to give up favorite foods, not liking the taste of healthy foods, not trusting experts’ seemingly ever-changing dietary advice—all of this can hinder our efforts to be healthy. People who live in “food deserts” without easy access to a supermarket may find it harder to eat fresh fruits and vegetables, and people who live in neighborhoods surrounded by fast-food restaurants may find it all too easy to choose higher-calorie, less-nutritious foods.<a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn67" id="ch05_fn67a"><sup class="frac">67</sup></a> Food prices may also be a barrier: lower-calorie, more-nutritious foods, such as fruits and vegetables and fish, are more costly per calorie than higher-calorie, less-nutritious foods, such as refined grains and sweets.<a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn68" id="ch05_fn68a"><sup class="frac">68</sup></a> Agricultural policies, food labeling, and food advertising can  <a id="page129"/>influence which foods are available to us in a supermarket or restaurant, whether we are aware of their nutrient benefits (or detriments), and whether we decide to eat them.</p>
<p class="indent">We will discuss how to build social support for healthy eating, as well as what steps you can take to advocate for a healthier food environment, in the following chapters. Here we will focus on the personal perspective: what are some of the common food-related habits that may be getting in the way of eating healthfully and achieving a healthier weight—and what are some tips to change them? Once you identify these personal barriers to healthy eating, you can start to overcome them and begin to make every meal a healthier one.</p>
<h3 class="section"><em>Do You Skip Breakfast or Other Meals?</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">Fewer people in the United States are starting the day with breakfast,<a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn69" id="ch05_fn69a"><sup class="frac">69</sup></a> and our increasing failure to “break the fast” every morning may be contributing to the obesity epidemic. Research suggests that people who skip breakfast tend to weigh more and gain more weight over time than people who eat breakfast.<a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn70" id="ch05_fn70a"><sup class="frac">70</sup></a> The National Weight Control Registry gathered information on the breakfast habits of nearly three thousand people who had lost and kept off significant amounts of weight, and found that nearly 80 percent of them report eating breakfast every day, while only 4 percent report skipping breakfast.<a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn71" id="ch05_fn71a"><sup class="frac">71</sup></a> Scientists are still teasing out the nature of the relationship between breakfast and weight. It’s possible that eating breakfast may help curb our hunger later in the day—and, in turn, the number of calories we eat, especially if the breakfast includes protein or fiber, such as that found in whole grains and fruits.<a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn72" id="ch05_fn72a"><sup class="frac">72</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Dieting books give all sorts of advice about when to have your meals—eat six small meals a day, stick to three meals a day and eschew snacks, don’t eat after 8 <strong><span class="small">P.M.</span></strong>, and so on. The truth is that there’s no “perfect” meal pattern that fits everyone’s lifestyle or that is guaranteed to promote weight loss. A good approach, however, is to spread your food  <a id="page130"/>intake throughout the day.<a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn73" id="ch05_fn73a"><sup class="frac">73</sup></a> This may mean three meals (one of them breakfast) and a snack or two, or four “mini-meals.”</p>
<p class="indent">If skipping breakfast or other meals has become a habit, consider these suggestions for how to change your habit:</p>
<div class="block1">
<ul>
<li><p class="indent">PREPARE YOUR BREAKFAST OR PACK YOUR LUNCH THE NIGHT BEFORE. If you find that you are skipping breakfast or lunch because you don’t have enough time to prepare it in the morning, plan breakfasts and lunches that can be assembled before you go to sleep. For lunch, set aside some of your dinner leftovers in a container, add a whole-wheat roll and piece of fruit or some baby carrots, and put it in a sack in the fridge so it will be ready for you to grab on your way out the door in the morning.</p></li>
<li><p class="indent">BROADEN YOUR IDEA OF BREAKFAST. Some people skip breakfast simply because they do not enjoy traditional U.S. breakfast foods such as cold cereal and milk or eggs and toast. There’s no reason to have such a limited palate. Try whole-grain hot cereals, combining whole grains and seeds such as sesame seeds, whole oats, whole rye, whole barley, millet, quinoa, and whole buckwheat. For convenience, you can cook a batch that lasts for a few days. Or try an Asian breakfast, with tofu or fish, vegetables, and brown rice. Make a breakfast burrito with beans, salsa, and a stone-ground-corn tortilla. Even last night’s leftovers can make a nourishing and satisfying breakfast.</p></li>
<li><p class="indent">MAKE SURE YOU’VE GOT A GOOD APPETITE FOR BREAKFAST. Overeating at night may make you less hungry for breakfast in the morning. If you’re a nighttime snacker who has little appetite in the morning, you may want to try curbing your nighttime snacking to see if that improves your appetite for breakfast the next day. In extreme cases, eating at night may be characterized as “night eating syndrome,” which we discuss later in this chapter.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3 class="section"><a id="page131"/><em>Do You Speed-Eat?</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">It has become common advice for dieters: “eat slowly and chew your food well.” And it certainly makes intuitive sense. The theory, popularized nearly forty years ago,<a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn74" id="ch05_fn74a"><sup class="frac">74</sup></a> is that it takes twenty minutes for our brains to register that our stomachs are full, and that when we eat too quickly, we speed through the physical and hormonal “stop” signs and overeat. Eating more slowly may also give us more pleasure from our food as we take time to savor every bite. Many, many researchers have sought to test this notion, sometimes with conflicting results,<a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn75" id="ch05_fn75a"><sup class="frac">75</sup></a> but recent support for the theory comes from a small study at the University of Rhode Island.<a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn76" id="ch05_fn76a"><sup class="frac">76</sup></a> Researchers asked thirty women to eat a meal rapidly and, several days later, to eat a meal slowly (or vice versa), and measured the amount of food they ate and how satisfied they felt at the end of each meal. When the women ate a meal slowly, they consumed fewer calories and drank more water than when they ate a meal rapidly. After the slow meal, they reported greater satiety than they did after the fast meal. So although they ate <em>less</em> than at the faster meal, they felt more satisfied and full. It’s interesting to note that Japanese studies on eating speed and weight control have found that people who say they eat rapidly weigh more and are more likely to be obese than people who say that they eat slowly.<a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn77" id="ch05_fn77a"><sup class="frac">77</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">If speed-eating has become a habit, consider these tips to slow down and savor your food:</p>
<div class="block1">
<ul>
<li><p class="indent">MAKE YOUR FIRST BITE—AND EVERY BITE—A MINDFUL BITE. Remember the apple meditation in chapter 2, where we asked you to pay attention—to feel the weight of the apple in your hand, notice its color and smell, and think about all the natural and human forces that aligned to bring it from the earth to your hand? We suggest that you do the same before you begin eating all of your meals.</p></li>
<li><p class="indent"> <a id="page132"/>TAKE SMALL BITES, CHEW YOUR FOOD THOROUGHLY, AND PUT DOWN YOUR UTENSILS IN BETWEEN EACH BITE. This has also been standard advice for people seeking to lose weight. And the University of Rhode Island study, which instructed participants to use these techniques during the slow meal, showed that taking these steps can help people slow down. Study participants’ slow meals lasted, on average, nearly thirty minutes—about twenty minutes longer than their fast meals. Using smaller spoons and forks or using chopsticks (especially if you are not accustomed to using chopsticks) may help you train yourself to take smaller bites.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3 class="section"><em>Do You Mindlessly Overeat Large Portions?</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">Often people overeat without being aware that they are overeating. They eat too much because they are snacking out of a supersize bag of chips, they have been served a heaping plate of food, they are watching television while they eat or because of any number of external cues that have nothing to do with hunger. Dr. Brian Wansink of Cornell University calls this type of eating “mindless eating,” and he and other researchers have demonstrated the many ways that our environment can trigger us to simply eat too much.<a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn78" id="ch05_fn78a"><sup class="frac">78</sup></a> Certainly there is ample opportunity to overeat: over the past few decades, portions have grown to gargantuan sizes in restaurants, grocery stores, and homes—even in the all-American classic cookbook <em>Joy of Cooking.<a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn79" id="ch05_fn79a"><sup class="frac">79</sup></a></em> These large portions lead us to unconsciously redefine what a “normal” portion size is, and also make it harder to estimate just how much we are eating.<a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn80" id="ch05_fn80a"><sup class="frac">80</sup></a> Having tempting foods in sight, being distracted by a magazine, being offered a variety of foods—all can lead to mindless overeating.<a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn81" id="ch05_fn81a"><sup class="frac">81</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">If you have gotten into the habit of eating with your eyes rather than your stomach, consider these tips to help you mindfully monitor your portion sizes:<a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn82" id="ch05_fn82a"><sup class="frac">82</sup></a></p>
<div class="block1">
<ul>
<li><p class="indent"> <a id="page133"/>USE SMALLER PLATES AND SERVING UTENSILS. Downsizing your plates, bowls, and serving spoons may help you downsize your portions.</p></li>
<li><p class="indent">AVOID DISTRACTIONS WHILE EATING. It makes intuitive sense that watching television during meals could lead you to pay less attention to what you are eating and how full you are—and in turn contribute to mindless overeating. Other distractions—a movie, a social gathering, workplace demands—could have a similar effect. So separate eating from watching television or other activities. When you are engaged in a pleasantly distracting activity that revolves around food—such as a dinner party—recognize that you need to pay greater attention to what you put on your plate and in your mouth. Periodically take regular, mindful breaths throughout the meal to help you remember to come back to your body and check in with your stomach. Relaxing your whole body with your mindful breathing as you eat is a good way to help you stay in tune with yourself and your meal and to avoid overeating.</p></li>
<li><p class="indent">ASK YOURSELF, “AM I SURE IT’S HEALTHY?” Our belief that a product is healthy or that a restaurant serves healthy food—what Wansink and colleagues call a “health halo”—can lead us astray when it comes to choosing moderate portions. People were more likely to underestimate the number of calories in a Subway meal than in a McDonald’s meal, perhaps because of the sandwich chain’s heavy marketing of itself as a “healthy” option, with its well-known advertisements featuring a famous customer’s weight loss.<a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn83" id="ch05_fn83a"><sup class="frac">83</sup></a> Before you place your order, stop, take a deep breath, and don’t lose your mindful outlook just because a food is pitched as “healthy.” Healthy foods have calories, and keeping calories in check is the key to weight loss.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3 class="section"><a id="page134"/><em>Do You Eat a Lot at Night?</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">It’s a common complaint from people who are trying hard to eat healthfully: “I make great choices all day, but after dinner, I just can’t stop snacking.” For some people, night eating means mindlessly munching on a bag of chips while they watch television or dishing out a bowl of ice cream as a reward for a stressful day. For others, so-called night eating syndrome is a more serious disorder of their circadian rhythms, one in which they consume at least 25 percent of their daily calories after dinner or wake up in the middle of the night to eat, leaving them with little or no appetite for breakfast.<a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn84" id="ch05_fn84a"><sup class="frac">84</sup></a> Although night eating syndrome is not technically classified as an eating disorder just yet, it is estimated that anywhere from 6 to 16 percent of people enrolled in weight-reduction programs suffer from it<a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn85" id="ch05_fn85a"><sup class="frac">85</sup></a> and that it can interfere with attempts to lose weight.<a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn86" id="ch05_fn86a"><sup class="frac">86</sup></a> You may not have full-blown night eating syndrome (if you believe you do, consult with a professional), but if you find that nighttime has become synonymous with unhealthy snack time, consider these tips:</p>
<div class="block1">
<ul>
<li><p class="indent">FIND SOMETHING ELSE TO DO WITH YOUR HANDS. Knit, make a scrapbook, read a book out loud to your children, play chess—do something to keep your hands busy and your mind engaged so that you will be less tempted to turn to food.</p></li>
<li><p class="indent">TURN OFF THE TELEVISION. As we will discuss, people tend to eat mindlessly when they watch television, and they tend to eat <em>what</em> they see in the commercials—mostly unhealthy snacks. Turning off the television and finding another nighttime activity can help you break the “eat-and-watch” habit.</p></li>
<li><p class="indent">BE AWARE OF WHERE YOU WORK. Checking your e-mail at the kitchen table after dinner can mean that you are too close to tempting snacks. Move to a different room. If you must work in the kitchen, keep the most tempting foods out of sight.<a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn87" id="ch05_fn87a"><sup class="frac">87</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p class="indent">REDUCE YOUR STRESS. There’s evidence that stress may trigger night eating syndrome and that lowering stress may help  <a id="page135"/>curb it: night eaters in a small one-week study who listened to a nightly twenty-minute muscle-relaxation tape before going to sleep reported less nighttime hunger and eating, and lower stress, than night eaters who did not de-stress.<a id="ch05_fn88a"/><a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn88"><sup class="frac">88</sup></a> This is a good time to try out the meditations offered throughout this book and on the companion Web site for this book. Or try some other relaxing activities, such as listening to soft music, reading a book, or taking a bath.</p></li>
<li><p class="indent">GO TO SLEEP EARLIER. As we discussed in chapter 1, people who get less sleep tend to weigh more than people who get a good night’s rest, and one reason may simply be that staying up later gives people more hours in the day to eat. Getting enough sleep may also help curb hunger during the day.</p></li>
<li><p class="indent">IF YOU DO SNACK IN THE EVENING, CHOOSE FRESH FRUITS AND VEGETABLES. If you mindfully decide to answer your body’s call for nighttime munchies, do it with fresh vegetables or fruits. They come packed with fiber, they fill you up quickly, and most don’t have that many calories.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 class="section"><em>Do You Often Eat Fast Food or Restaurant Meals?</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">Americans spend more than 40 percent of their food budgets on food away from home,<a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn89" id="ch05_fn89a"><sup class="frac">89</sup></a> and research has found that meals prepared outside the home tend to be less healthful than what we cook up in our own kitchens.<a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn90" id="ch05_fn90a"><sup class="frac">90</sup></a> The best thing to do when you are trying to lose weight is to cut out fast food completely. Even the “healthy” choices aren’t usually that healthy. Consider these tips to make the healthiest choices when you are out at fast-food or regular restaurants:</p>
<div class="block1">
<ul>
<li><p class="indent">DO YOUR RESEARCH AHEAD OF TIME. Many restaurants now have nutrition information available online, and it may surprise you. At some fast-food restaurants, for example, a small  <a id="page136"/>sandwich may be lower in calories than a large salad loaded with cheese and toppings.</p></li>
<li><p class="indent">ORDER SMALLER PORTIONS. When we eat at a restaurant, once the food appears on our plates, chances are good that we will eat it—and the larger the portions, the more we will eat. So order a small appetizer instead of an entrée, share an entrée with your dining companion, or ask the waiter to bring you a “to go” container with your meal so that you can put half of your meal in the container before you have a chance to overindulge. And skip the extras—bread and butter, unlimited sugary fountain drinks—to save your appetite and calories for more nutritious and satisfying foods.</p></li>
<li><p class="indent">DON’T BUY THE FAST-FOOD “MEALS.” Going à la carte at a fast-food restaurant may cost a little bit more, even for buying less food, but who really needs to be tempted by the fifteen hundred calories in a complete meal with large fries, big burger, and thirty ounces of sugary soda? You’ll be surprised at how filling a smaller sandwich and smaller fries can be, especially if you eat slowly and savor them.</p></li>
<li><p class="indent">ORDER COFFEE OR TEA AFTER THE MEAL RATHER THAN DESSERT. Wansink notes that the relaxing atmosphere of a candlelit restaurant can make a meal more pleasant but can also lead people to spend a longer time at the table—and to eat more.<a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn91" id="ch05_fn91a"><sup class="frac">91</sup></a> His suggestion: linger over a cup of coffee rather than a high-calorie dessert.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 class="section"><em>Do You Lack the Time to Prepare Healthy Meals?</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">Time pressures from work and family can make us all feel strapped, and lack of time for meal preparation is seen as a barrier to healthy eating.<a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn92" id="ch05_fn92a"><sup class="frac">92</sup></a> But with careful planning, healthy eating does not need to take any more time than going out for takeout or popping a frozen pizza into the oven. Consider these tips:</p>
<div class="block1">
<ul>
<li><p class="indent"> <a id="page137"/>DIVVY UP THE DINNERTIME DUTIES. Involve family members or roommates in meal preparation; even young children can help. If you live alone, consider creating a healthy lunch or dinner swap with four of your friends or colleagues at work: Assign everyone to make a quintuple-size batch of a healthy entrée over the weekend, and divide the batches into portable containers. On Monday, bring them in and swap, and you will each have enough lunches or dinners for the week.</p></li>
<li><p class="indent">BE REALLY CAREFUL ABOUT CONVENIENCE FOODS. You may turn to convenience foods to shave some time off meal preparation, but they can have their drawbacks. Some processed foods are loaded with added salt or sugar or are high in unhealthy fats. Look for frozen entrées that have less than 300 milligrams sodium, less than two grams of saturated fat, and zero grams trans fat and that offer at least a few grams of fiber per serving; add fresh fruit or a salad to round out the meal. Or make your own convenience “health” foods: cook up a large batch of whole grains, dried beans, or roasted vegetables on Sunday and use them at meals throughout the week or freeze them in small portions so that you can grab one for an easy lunch or dinner.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3 class="section"><em>Do You Eat More on the Weekends Than During the Week?</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">Weekends are a time for relaxing, socializing, and, for many of us, overeating—and these small indulgences may lead dieters to gain weight or slow their weight loss. The National Weight Control Registry has found that people who stick to the same eating patterns on the weekends, on holidays, or on vacations as they do during the week tend to be more successful at maintaining their weight loss.<a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn93" id="ch05_fn93a"><sup class="frac">93</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">If you find yourself falling away from your healthy eating intentions on the weekends, consider these suggestions to keep you on track:</p>
<div class="block1">
<ul>
<li><p class="indent"> <a id="page138"/>KEEP A FOOD DIARY. Research suggests that people who keep track of what they eat may be more successful at weight loss and at avoiding weight regain, since self-monitoring is a key element of self-regulation.<a id="ch05_fn94a"/><a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn94"><sup class="frac">94</sup></a> Jot down everything you eat and drink on your calendar, your smart phone, or one of several Web sites that offer free online food logs. You could even try taking a digital photo of what you eat: a picture is worth a thousand words, and there’s evidence that taking pictures of what you eat may make you more aware of your food choices.<a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn95" id="ch05_fn95a"><sup class="frac">95</sup></a> Don’t agonize over the food-diary details; keeping the entries short may be just as effective for weight loss.<a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn96" id="ch05_fn96a"><sup class="frac">96</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p class="indent">PLAN FOR MEALS WHEN YOU ARE ON THE GO. If you will be out running errands all day, pack healthy snacks in a cooler and take time for a mindful lunch break. If you will be eating lunch at a chain restaurant, scan the restaurant’s Web site before you head out; most have nutrition information available that can help you pick the most healthful choices.</p></li>
<li><p class="indent">MAKE YOUR SOCIAL TIME ACTIVE TIME, NOT EATING TIME. Rather than meeting a friend for a sugar-laden coffeehouse drink, meet for a brisk walk. Or go out dancing on a Saturday night instead of going out for dinner. (For more ideas on how to get active, see chapter 6.)</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3 class="section"><em>Do You Eat When You Are Angry, Sad, Bored, or Stressed?</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">The relationship between food and emotions is a complicated one. At one end of the spectrum is someone who has a stressful day at work and finds comfort in a candy bar on the way home. At the other end is someone who struggles with anorexia, bulimia, binge eating, or another type of disordered eating. Stress as well as several emotions may prompt someone to turn to food for comfort—among them anger, anxiety,  <a id="page139"/>boredom, loneliness, and sadness.<a id="ch05_fn97a"/><a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn97"><sup class="frac">97</sup></a> There are a variety of techniques for changing your behavior or changing your thought process to cope with emotional eating.<a class="hlink" href="9780061981456_epub_nts_r1.htm#ch05_fn98" id="ch05_fn98a"><sup class="frac">98</sup></a> If you are concerned that emotional eating may be derailing your attempts at healthy eating, consider these tips to help you avoid using food to manage your feelings:</p>
<div class="block1">
<ul>
<li><p class="indent">USE MINDFULNESS TO RECOGNIZE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL HUNGER. Before going to the refrigerator or heading to the snack-food aisle of the supermarket, stop, take a slow, deep in-breath, and on the out-breath ask yourself this question: am I truly hungry, or do I crave these comfort foods to ease my stress or relieve another emotion? If you keep a food diary, jotting down your mood and your level of hunger when you eat may help you identify if and when your emotions are leading you to overeat.</p></li>
<li><p class="indent">SEEK ALTERNATIVE WAYS TO COPE WITH STRESS AND EMOTIONS. Walking, yoga, mindfulness meditation, singing along with your MP3 player, gardening, taking an herb-scented bath, having a phone conversation with a friend—these are just some of the many activities you can choose to help ease stress and provide a food-free alternative for channeling your emotions.</p></li>
<li><p class="indent">KEEP TEMPTING FOODS AWAY FROM YOUR HIGH-STRESS ZONES. If you are under a lot of pressure at work, replace the candy jar on your desk with a squeeze stress ball or a desktop Zen fountain.</p></li>
<li><p class="indent">CONSULT WITH A PROFESSIONAL WHO SPECIALIZES IN EMOTIONAL EATING. If you can’t curtail your emotional eating on your own, you may want to find a psychiatrist or therapist who specializes in food-mood issues. Your doctor or your employee-assistance program at work can likely provide a referral. The National Eating Disorders Association has a toll-free information number as well as a directory of providers and support  <a id="page140"/>groups on its Web site: //http://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/get-help-today/.</p></li>

<h2 class="section">Translating Knowledge to Action: Your In Eating Strategy</h2>
<p class="nonindent">We have given you a menu of options for making healthy changes to your daily diet. We have reviewed the best food choices for health, the common barriers to healthy eating, and, so that you can truly savor your food, the connection between mindfulness and eating. Now it is time to put it all together and create a practical strategy that allows you to enjoy mindfulness at every meal—and to move closer to your goal of achieving a healthier weight. We call it your in Eating strategy, where the <em>in</em> means being in the present moment. With your in Eating strategy, you will be able to set goals for mindful, healthy eating and mindfully avoiding overeating, figure out ways around any barriers that might keep you from reaching your goals, and lay out the steps you will take to reach your goals. This <em>in</em>Eating strategy will be incorporated into your comprehensive Mindful Living Plan in chapter 7.</p>
<p class="indent">As we have discussed, mindful eating encompasses what we eat as well as how we eat—habits that are deeply ingrained and that require dedicated effort to change. While there are many possible changes you can make on either of these dimensions of mindful eating, only you can decide which changes are the most important to you and the most doable. To help you identify your <em>in</em>Eating goals, what will help you reach them, and the barriers you may face, reflect on the series of questions that follow. Journaling may help you as you consider your responses and chart your strategy.</p>
<p class="indent">Use your reflections to choose the goals that are most important and doable for you, and create your own <em>in</em>Eating practice, like the example in table 7.1. Once you are successful at changing one habit, build on your success to make other healthy changes. Keeping a log of your <em>in</em>Eating progress may help you better achieve your goals.</p>
<p class="indent"> <a id="page141"/>Like all action plans, the inEating strategy is not meant to be a static document. As you gain experience with healthy, mindful eating and work through barriers, your goals and tips for overcoming barriers may change. Bear in mind the impermanent nature of all we do. Don’t be afraid to adjust things, as long as you make sure you stay committed to and working toward your ultimate goal: choosing healthy, delicious foods at every meal, making every bite a mindful bite, and losing weight and keeping it off.</p>
<p class="extract"><strong>Why do you want to eat more healthfully and mindfully?</strong></p>
<p class="indent">Think about the reasons you want to make healthier food choices and choose smaller portion sizes. And think about all the reasons you want to bring mindfulness to your meals. They can cut across all parts of your life. It would be useful to write these reasons down in a journal so that you can reflect on them later.</p>
<p class="indent">Examples: <em>I want to feel better about myself. I want to lose weight. I want to lower my bad cholesterol. I want to lower my risk of diabetes. I want to lower the carbon footprint of my food choices. I want to slow down so I can truly savor my food.</em></p>
<p class="extract"><strong>What’s bad about eating foods that are unhealthy for you or for the planet, eating too much, or eating mindlessly?</strong></p>
<p class="indent">Think about the downsides of choosing unhealthy foods—for your own health and for the environment—and the downsides of eating more food than your body needs for nourishment. Think about the downsides of not paying attention to the act of eating or of ignoring the full implications of your food choices. Again, they can cut across all parts of your life.</p>
<p class="indent">Examples: <em>I’ll stay heavy. I won’t feel good about myself. I’ll see my cholesterol go up. I’ll be wasting money and the planet’s resources by eating more food than I need.</em></p>
<p class="nonindent"> <a id="page142"/><strong>What healthy foods do you like? What healthy foods would you be willing to try? What mindful eating practices would you be willing to try?</strong></p>
<p class="indent">Think about the healthy foods that give you joy. Think about the healthy foods that you do not currently eat but could consider adding to your meals. Write down those foods and the reasons that you want to make them a part of your meals. Then, think about all the practices of mindful eaters, which of those practices you would like to incorporate, and why.</p>
<p class="indent">Food examples: <em>Dark leafy greens, since they will give my bones calcium and vitamin K. Plant proteins like walnuts and lentils, since they are better for the planet and have beneficial nutrients for my body. Brightly colored fruits such as strawberries and blueberries, because their natural sweetness will satisfy my sweet tooth without sending my blood sugar soaring.</em></p>
<p class="indent">Mindful eating practice examples: <em>Focusing on my food will give me greater enjoyment during my meals. Choosing smaller portions will be better for the planet and will also help me curb my daily calorie intake.</em></p>
<p class="extract"><strong>What are some of the unhealthy foods that you could trade for healthier foods? What are some of the unmindful habits that you could most easily leave behind?</strong></p>
<p class="indent">Think about the foods you eat that your body does not require for nourishment and that may actually harm your health—sugary drinks, refined grains, processed meats, salty snacks. Write down these foods and how you could trade them for healthier foods. Think about the habits you have that do not serve your desire to be fully present during the act of eating.</p>
<p class="indent">Food trade examples: <em>I can choose unsweetened iced tea instead of soda pop. I can snack on crunchy vegetables instead of chips. I can buy wholewheat pasta instead of white pasta. I can drizzle olive oil on my vegetables instead of butter.</em></p>
<p class="indent"> <a id="page143"/>Mindful eating habit examples: <em>I can have a silent cup of tea in the morning instead of spending my break calling a friend on my cell phone. I can tell my supervisor that I will be taking a full half hour for lunch instead of scarfing down lunch at my desk, and then make up that time later.</em></p>
<p class="extract"><strong>In what meal during the day would it be easiest for you to trade healthy foods for unhealthy foods? In what meal during the day would it be easiest for you to incorporate one or more of the seven practices of a mindful eater?</strong></p>
<p class="indent">Your ultimate goal is to make every meal a healthy, mindful meal. But for some people, it can be overwhelming to attempt to change everything all at once. You may find it easier to pick one meal a day to start—perhaps the meal in which you have the most control over your food choices, the most time to eat, or the fewest distractions.</p>
<p class="indent">Food examples: <em>I can make healthy food trades at:</em></p>
<div class="block1">
<ul>
<li><p class="indent"><em>breakfast, since it’s the one meal I eat at home every day</em></p></li>
<li><p class="indent"><em>lunch, because there’s a great salad bar in the cafeteria</em></p></li>
<li><p class="indent"><em>the food court, because the burrito shop offers brown rice</em></p></li>
<li><p class="indent"><em>the gym, because I can fill my water bottle instead of buying an energy drink</em></p></li>
<li><p class="indent"><em>Sunday dinner, because I shop at the farm stand in the morning and cook a vegetarian dinner for the whole family</em></p></li>
<li><p class="indent"><em>evening snack, since I can eat fruit instead of cookies</em></p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="indent">Mindful eating practice examples: <em>I can incorporate a new mindful eating practice at:</em></p>
<div class="block1">
<ul>
<li><p class="indent"><em>breakfast, since I usually eat alone</em></p></li>
<li><p class="indent"><em>lunch, since there is a great vegetarian restaurant in the food court where I can use chopsticks and experiment with taking smaller bites</em></p></li>
<li><p class="indent"> <a id="page144"/><em>dinner, since I can use a smaller plate to help myself choose smaller portions</em></p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="extract"><strong>What are two or three obstacles that can make it hard for you to choose healthy foods and moderate portions? What are obstacles that could make it hard for you to eat more mindfully? What are a few ways around each of these?</strong></p>
<p class="indent">Finding your way around obstacles that get in the way of healthy eating is a necessary and ongoing part of the process, and this is so for everyone, from a professional nutritionist to a person just starting out to make healthy choices. Think about some of the key things that keep you from making healthy food choices or lead you to overeat. They may be part of the list of barriers and habits we went over earlier in this chapter, or they may be something else entirely. Once you have the top two or three, write them down, and then come up with ways you can get around them. This will be your go-to list when things get tough and you are looking for reasons to return to your old ways of eating.</p>
<p class="indent">Examples:</p>
<div class="block">
<p class="indent"><em>Obstacle:</em> I don’t have enough time to eat breakfast.</p>
<p class="indent"><em>My solution:</em> I’ll get my cereal and raisins ready on the counter the night before. Or I’ll get up fifteen minutes earlier so that I have time to eat breakfast in the work cafeteria before going to my desk.</p>
<p class="extract"><em>Obstacle:</em> I snack mindlessly while I watch television late into the night.</p>
<p class="indent"><em>My solution:</em> I can track my TV time and make sure it’s less than one hour at night. I can make a pact with a friend to call each other with a turn-off-the-TV reminder at a preappointed time to encourage each other to get a good night’s rest; to help us consume programs more mindfully, my friend and I can also share about the program we just watched and discuss  <a id="page145"/>which seeds it watered in us. Before going to the fridge at night or opening a bag of chips, I can ask myself whether I am truly hungry. I can go to sleep earlier.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="section">The Bottom Line</h2>
<p class="nonindent">Mindful eating is a way to incorporate mindfulness into one of the most fundamental activities of our existence. It is a way to nourish our bodies and our minds. It is a way to help us achieve a healthier weight, and a way to appreciate the relationship between the food on our table, our health, and the health of the planet. It is a way to grow our compassion for all living beings and imbue reverence for life into every bite.</p>
<p class="indent">For something so rich in positives, though, it’s not the easiest of steps for us to take. Living as we all are in a society that spends so much time and money to promote unhealthy foods and mindless eating, and to limit access to healthy foods, it takes a dedicated, mindful effort to be able to focus on and choose the foods that are best for our bodies and best for our planet. The steps described in this chapter give you the tools you need to listen to your body, to live in the moment, and to become a truly mindful, healthy eater.</p>
