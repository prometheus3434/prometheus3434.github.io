<p class="justifypara">There are so many incredible people who have helped, supported, and inspired me in my journey and in the creation of this book. First, I would like to thank all four of my parents. You have all taught me so much more than you know. Mom, thank you for being my rock and for your love, honesty, strength, and grace. Dad, thank you for inspiring me with your entrepreneurial spirit. Keith (my second dad), I love and appreciate you so much. Jennifer, thank you for your joyful energy and for being a wonderful partner to my dad. Scott, Loren, Stacey, and Dana, I could not be a more fortunate sister. Thank you to my whole, big, wonderfully complex family—nieces, nephews, aunts, uncles, in-laws, and long lost (and newly discovered) family members. I love you all.</p>
<p class="indentpara">I would like to extend tremendous gratitude and appreciation to my literary agent Bill Gladstone. Thank you for believing in me and for guiding me to believe in myself even more. A huge thanks to my gifted editors Lora Sickora and Jennifer Levesque. Your support, brilliant suggestions, and guidance have been invaluable. Enormous thanks to Aly Mostel, Evan Klonsky, Alyse Diamond, Aaron Pattap, Chris Gaugler, and the entire team at Rodale.
