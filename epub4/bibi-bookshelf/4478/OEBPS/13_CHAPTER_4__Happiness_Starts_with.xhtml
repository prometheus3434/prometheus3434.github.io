<p class="chhead2">Happiness Starts with Your First Thoughts of the Day</p>
<p class="justifypara"><span class="fontsize">I’m one of the</span> happiest people I know. I love my life, live with passion, and wake up nearly every day excited about what’s ahead. When I think of how it didn’t used to be that way for me, how much I struggled for so many years, I’m filled with immense gratitude for all I’ve learned and the changes I’ve made.</p>
<p class="indentpara">This leads me to share with you the single most monumental and profound change I made to live and sustain the happiness I was looking for: <em>I changed the way I was living my mornings.</em></p>
<p class="indentpara">For years, I was caught in a pattern of waking up thinking about the negative, the stressful, and the to-do list for the day. I was skipping breakfast (or worse, eating for breakfast what should actually be dessert), rushing to get out the door, taking zero time to be mindful or set my intentions for what I wanted my day—or my life—to look like. I just threw caution to the wind and left the outcome of my day to chance rather than work to consciously craft the day I desired from the moment I woke up. Millions of people live this way. It’s an epidemic. I truly believe that much of the unhappiness in this world is due to the way people are starting their mornings.</p>
<p class="indentpara"><span id="page_86">There’s</span> even research to support this. For example, a University of Toronto study published in the American Psychological Association journal <em>Emotion</em> found in a survey of more than seven hundred participants ages seventeen to seventy-nine that those who consider themselves morning people generally feel happier and healthier than night owls.</p>
<p class="indentpara">When I went through my own huge transformation a few years back, I was so determined to create change, I began waking up each day and immediately focusing on quality, uplifting thoughts and actions that supported my happiness. When I first started, it felt a little unnatural because I was breaking out of old patterns that were so ingrained. But after a while, the positive changes and habits became second nature, and the most important bricks in the foundation of my happiness became solid. Later, when I was really studying and evaluating exactly what I did that created such positive, sustainable results, I realized that specifically changing my mornings had the biggest impact on changing my entire life.</p>
<p class="indentpara">When practicing the skill of happiness and creating the beautiful life you desire and deserve, this is exactly where to begin: your mornings. I can’t emphasize this enough, which is why I’ve devoted an entire section of the book to it. The way we start each day essentially determines what kind of day we’ll have and, therefore, what kind of life we’ll have.</p>
<p class="justifypara1">Now it’s not like this morning thing is a huge, undiscovered secret. Billionaire entrepreneurs, CEOs, powerful business strategists, and the world’s most gifted spiritual leaders all prize their morning routines as the foundation for their success, happiness, and inner peace. They know that true success begins with authen<span id="page_87">tic</span> happiness (not the other way around) and that mornings are the time to make it happen. But incredibly, this concept is so massively overlooked, it goes completely undiscovered by most people.</p>
<p class="indentpara">From the time we’re kids, we are conditioned to see mornings as rushed, hectic, stressful, and full of demands on our energy. We carry this into adulthood as the norm, without realizing the immense deficiency it’s causing in our lives on every level.</p>
<p class="indentpara">When I’m teaching workshops or speaking to groups, one of the most common things people share with me is that they “get” all the positivity stuff and they know basically what’s needed to create a happier life, but they feel a little overwhelmed by it all and aren’t sure where to begin . . . so they don’t. They get caught in a cycle of going to motivational classes and reading spiritual books without ever creating any significant change. This is why I am so passionate about helping you make over your mornings! This is a doable, tangible place for anyone to start implementing everything in a way that will have incredible impact and create the momentum needed for authentic, sustainable, positive change. Just start with your mornings, and I can promise you, you will change your life.</p>
<p class="subhead"><strong>GENTLY SHIFTING OLD HABITS</strong></p>
<p class="justifypara">Creating the changes in your mornings that will set the foundation for happiness and success throughout each day—and every day—takes heightened awareness. At first, you’ll have to catch yourself when you veer off the path, but if you stick to it long enough, the flow will become natural.</p>
<p class="indentpara">My friend Amateo Ra, a super-wise spiritual teacher and business coach, has been working toward creating this powerful shift in his own life. He recently shared a relatable story with me that is a fantastic example of lovingly nudging yourself to course correct when you feel yourself slipping back into old habits.</p>
<p class="indentpara"><em>Yesterday morning, I woke up and started my day in a hurry. I began cleaning, getting my day started, and soon was on social media and checking e-mail.</em></p>
<p class="indentpara"><em><span id="page_88">I</span> quickly realized I had a sense of rush or hurriedness and could see it reflected in my surroundings. Our internal resonance creates our external reality. I quickly came to my senses and decided to do something drastic.</em></p>
<p class="indentpara"><em>So I got back in bed and began to restart my day with gratitude, love, joy, rest, and grace. Oh, and some deep filling of my Source tank. After a full reset, I felt like a new person and ended up having an extremely productive, clear, and creative day. I totally crushed it.</em></p>
<p class="indentpara"><em>Conscious living is about compassionate self-awareness. It’s not about doing everything perfectly; it’s about how to course correct on each step of life to get into the groove of what you truly desire.</em></p>
<p class="indentpara">While not everyone has the time on a busy weekday morning to crawl back into bed for longer than a minute or two, we all have the time and power to pause, reset, and consciously change paths when we become aware that the vibe we’re on is not empowering us. Amateo’s story is a great example of this awareness and how he created a shift that changed the course of his entire day. It’s all about discovering what works for you and pulling those tools and practices out when you need them.</p>
<p class="indentpara">I’m starting the section on making over your mornings with this chapter on the tremendous power of your morning thoughts and how the happiness in your life begins with your first thoughts of the day. This is truly where it all starts. Then we’ll have some fun in later chapters discussing ways to reinvent your morning routine, busting anxiety (and sleeping better), eating for happiness, and creating surroundings that support your joy. Ready to take some powerful action steps with me? Here we go!</p>
<p class="subhead"><strong>THE POWER OF YOUR MORNING THOUGHTS</strong></p>
<p class="justifypara">The energy, thoughts, and mind-sets we take on in the first minutes and hours of the day are carried with us throughout the day. A day that starts with feeling rushed, depleted, stressed out, and negative <span id="page_89">will</span> ultimately turn out that way. Even if you think you’re doing pretty well in this area, you might be surprised by how you can step it up even more and make a huge difference.</p>
<p class="indentpara">In <a href="10_CHAPTER_2__The_Five_Key_Happines.xhtml#page_21">Chapter 2</a>, we covered thought management, and now we’re going to go a little deeper, because the place to begin is in our very first thoughts of the day. These are some of the most influential and powerful thoughts in our lives, and mastering them can create major transformation.</p>
<p class="indentpara">As you’re waking up each morning, those first few thoughts that float through your cloudy mind are some of your most powerful, and they set the stage for your entire day. With practice, you can teach yourself to shift your focus when you wake up to make your first thoughts of the day positive, inspiring, and high quality.</p>
<p class="indentpara">After I had surgery on my shoulder in 2008 and decided to use the recovery time to become happier once and for all, one of the first things I did was set an intention to see how I could change my thoughts in some areas.</p>
<p class="indentpara">I’d learned over the years through my research how powerful thoughts are, and knowing that simply changing the way you look at something can bring a whole new perspective, I began to look for patterns in my thoughts that could be contributing to the not-so-desirable place I’d been in for so long. I really wanted to identify some of the blocks that were preventing me from moving forward in the positive way I desired.</p>
<p class="indentpara">After carefully tuning in to my thought patterns for a few days, I noticed that when I was first opening my eyes in the morning, and even before that, many of the thoughts running through my mind were of stuff that made me feel instantly drained or bummed out. I was waking up with images of people who had recently caused me pain, projects that were dragging me down, obligations that weren’t feeding my soul, and on it goes. I was getting out of bed and starting my day like that! No wonder I’d been in such a funk for so long!</p>
<p class="indentpara">If I could be more conscious of my very first thoughts in the <span id="page_90">morning</span> and make a deliberate effort to be sure they were pleasant, positive, and healing, could that potentially change . . . everything?</p>
<p class="indentpara">I went on a mission to be very aware of my first thoughts upon waking. Could I teach myself to automatically wake up in a loving, nurturing state? For the next few weeks, as soon as I was awake in the morning, I immediately brushed off any negative thoughts that tried to creep in and challenged myself to replace them with something happy or inspiring.</p>
<p class="indentpara">We’re all a little spacey when we first wake up, right? Well, I’m no exception. So upon waking, when I’d notice my thoughts, I’d work to remember my mission to think of positive thoughts and images in those moments, and then just allow my mind to flow to whatever happy things organically popped up: lemon drops, an excited dog barking in the distance, birds chirping, gratitude for how fantastically cozy the bed was. I focused on anything that would steer me away from any negative junk that tried to creep in.</p>
<p class="indentpara">The first few days were a bit challenging, and I caught myself straying to nasty places in my mind a few times, but as soon as I noticed it, I would quickly shift back to positive. It almost became like a fun game. And holy cow, some of the crap I discovered sneaking into my head in the morning was frightening!</p>
<p class="indentpara">As I woke up further, I would shift to more complex empowering thoughts, like <em>I’m going to create a great day today</em> (and then think about the “how”). I would also practice thinking positive, empowering affirmations that applied to the day ahead. Even on what seemed to be the hardest days, simple thoughts like <em>I’m thankful to be safe and in a calm, quiet place</em> were amazingly helpful.</p>
<p class="indentpara">After practicing this for a few weeks, I noticed it became easier, and I was getting out of bed not just in a happier place, but also in an amazingly blissful state. Everything seemed brighter, and when my feet hit the ground, I was ready and excited for a great day ahead. It all started to come naturally.</p>
<p class="indentpara"><span id="page_91">Some</span> of the things that had been plaguing me before began to fall away. Clarity began to emerge, and new perspective set in. I was more productive and optimistic, and my days kept getting better and better. I even started to apply the positive thought practice during the day or in the evenings when I found myself slipping into the negative. I learned to brush off negative thoughts the same way I would shoo a fly.</p>
<p class="indentpara">After a month or so, the change in my morning thoughts became automatic. The happy morning thoughts, and therefore happy mornings and better days, became a permanent shift.</p>
<p class="subhead"><strong>MORE THOUGHT-CHANGING TOOLS</strong></p>
<p class="justifypara">Changing your first thoughts, as well as your routine in the morning, to bring in the positive is not only part of a fresh way to approach achieving a happier life, it’s also a fundamental part of bringing more energy, optimism, and success into your world.</p>
<p class="indentpara5">Here are a few helpful tools and ideas to help you create your daily practice of waking up in a positive, empowering place. I use them to keep me on track. I love them because they’re super-simple and because they really work.</p>
<p class="hanging4"><span class="C561">•</span><strong>Keep a pad and pen next to the bed to write down positive thoughts and affirmations when they come to mind.</strong> When you need a little nudge in the morning, grab it and read away. You can also use this to write down those great ideas that pop into your head in the middle of the night and nag you until you either lose them forever (a major bummer) or write them down. Those are some of the brightest ideas, and it’s important to capture them (not to mention, getting them on paper and out of your head brings instant peace).</p>
<p class="hanging4"><span class="C561">•</span><strong>Memorize a favorite saying or affirmation as a default phrase you can shift to when needed.</strong> One of my favorites is “It’s a brand-new day and another opportunity to create joy and success.”</p>
<p class="hanging4"><span class="C561"><span id="page_92">•</span></span><strong>Keep a favorite quote or affirmation in a frame on your nightstand.</strong> This will always put you in a better place. I have a quote I love from Neale Donald Walsch that reads, “If you want the best the world has to offer, offer the world your best.”</p>
<p class="hanging4"><span class="C561">•</span><strong>Keep a glass of water next to your bed so it’s waiting for you when you wake up.</strong> The water will be there to welcome you to the new day, refresh your body, and start you off in a nurtured place. It’s a physical reminder that you should do loving things for yourself. I can’t stress enough how important it is to give your body the gift of hydration. Hydration = energy! We’ll be talking about that more in <a href="16_CHAPTER_7__The_Love_Centered_Die.xhtml#page_117">Chapter 7</a>.</p>
<p class="hanging4"><span class="C561">•</span><strong>Subscribe to a positive blog or newsletter so you have a regular flow of uplifting content to read anytime you need it.</strong> I’ve made a habit of reading at least one every morning when I have my tea or coffee. Do this before you open yourself up to whatever the current news headlines are that day. They can wait. You can use the <a href="20_YOUR_DAYBOOK_Thirty_Days_of_Insi.xhtml#page_175">daybook section</a> to begin creating the habit of daily positive reading. I’ve also included a few of my favorite Web sites for positive reading in <a href="21_SUGGESTED_READING.xhtml#page_245">Suggested Reading</a>.</p>
<p class="subhead"><strong>THE THREE S’S</strong></p>
<p class="justifypara">Oh, how I’m excited to share this one with you! It’s a simple tool I originally created for myself as a simple way to get into the right mind-set each morning. I found it worked so well that I started teaching it, and it has become one of the most popular practices I share. It’s quick, super-powerful, super-easy, and when practiced enough, it becomes second nature to reach for it in the mornings or whenever you need to hit your inner reset button. I’ve received tons of e-mails about how this has created big change for people (which lights up my heart).</p>
<p class="indentpara"><span id="page_93">I’m</span> big on simplicity, and nothing gets me inspired more than super-simple tools that produce kick-ass results. The Three S’s is definitely one of those.</p>
<p class="subhead1"><strong>How to Do the Three S’s</strong></p>
<p class="justifypara">You can do this when you wake in the morning (I like to do it while I’m still in bed resting, paying attention to the sounds of the birds outside, etc.) or any time of day you’re feeling stressed or need a mini-break or a change in energy.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Close your eyes and do these three things—in order—and feel the shift! It only takes a minute or two, but it can change the course of your whole day and attract amazing things!</p>
<p class="indentpara"><strong>Smile.</strong> Science has shown that the simple, physical act of cracking a smile triggers the release of the chemical dopamine in the brain, which creates a feel-good state. It even works if you’re faking the smile, so if you need to, fake it till you make it! Hold it for around thirty seconds. When you feel a shift in your energy, move on to the second S. Try holding the smile through the next two S’s for maximum impact and to keep the energy flowing.</p>
<p class="indentpara"><strong>Say thanks.</strong> The energy of gratitude is amazing! Take a minute now to think about what you’re grateful for in this moment. Picture some of these things in your mind’s eye if you can (favorite people, favorite foods, simple pleasures, your warm bed, etc.). Feel the positive transformation that comes from shifting your mind-set to a place of gratitude. This sets the fuel for the next S. When you feel ready, move on to the final S.</p>
<p class="indentpara"><strong>Set an intention.</strong> Now that you’ve created a positive shift in your heart and mind through smiling and saying thanks, it’s time to set an intention. It can be general, such as “I intend to enjoy today and spend time with people who inspire me.” It can be specific, like “I intend to be a valuable contributor in today’s office meeting, and my ideas will be well received.” One of my favorites is “I intend to take excellent care of my mind and body today and to inspire others to do the same.” The first two S’s not only put <span id="page_94">energetic</span> fuel behind your intention, they also help connect you to your soul so your intention can come from deep within, which really helps it stick.</p>
<p class="indentpara">That’s it! Open your eyes and go about the rest of your day with better energy, a brighter outlook, and a clear intention. Keep the Three S’s in your happiness toolbox and bust them out anytime you need them. See if you can turn this into a new daily habit. Remember: Small shifts create miracles!</p>
