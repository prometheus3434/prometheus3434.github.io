<p class="chhead2">Happy Surroundings: Creating Spaces That Support Your Joy</p>
<p class="justifypara"><span class="fontsize">When you open your</span> eyes in the morning, do you absolutely love the space you’re waking up in? Are your bathroom, kitchen, and work spaces set up and designed in ways that help you start your day feeling organized, energized, and together?</p>
<p class="indentpara">Our living spaces can have a significant effect on our happiness, energy, and quality of life. When they’re designed and organized in the right way, they can set us up for success on many levels, including sticking to habits that support our happiness and well-being. Sometimes, we don’t realize just how much the spaces we’re spending time in are affecting the way we feel until we start making changes. Clutter, disorganization, and things we just don’t love to look at are like nails in the tires of our joy. And making a few simple changes to create more soulful, uplifting spaces that better support your happiness can make a huge positive difference.</p>
<p class="subhead"><strong><span id="page_138">MAKING</span> OVER YOUR SACRED SPACES</strong></p>
<p class="justifypara">Because the way we live our mornings is vital to our lives, the spaces in which we spend time before 10:00 a.m. are especially important. So we’re going to focus on the bedroom, bathroom, kitchen, and work space as we step into a soulful little adventure in identifying and clearing clutter, embracing a bit of minimalism, and creating inspiring, supportive spaces.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Since many of the principles we’ll cover in this chapter can apply to other spaces as well, I encourage you to take any ideas that will work elsewhere and run with them. Think in terms of creating spaces that please and nurture all your senses.</p>
<p class="indentpara">When I began to discover the significant ways our mornings affect the way our lives unfold, it really stood out to me that the design and organization of our living spaces can either hugely support or majorly take away from the quality of our mornings, and our lives. This is especially true when it comes to clutter, one of the biggest joy-zappers, but also when it comes to experiencing beauty (which our souls crave), comfort, inspiration, and breathing space. I closely examined the spaces I was starting my day in. I realized that clutter; old, mismatched linens; a fiasco of an overstuffed closet; a bathroom I didn’t like; and disorganized drawers had been draining my good energy and sucking up valuable time, causing me to step into life each day with a slight joy deficit.</p>
<p class="indentpara">After major decluttering, reorganizing, adding some new linens and paint colors, overhauling a closet with the help of a stylish friend, and creating better flow by rearranging some of the furniture, I noticed a huge difference in the way I felt in the mornings, as well as how smoothly my days were going. I felt lighter . . . brighter . . . better. Across the board!</p>
<p class="indentpara">I now schedule a weekend every year to go through and organize, reassess, edit, and redecorate, as needed. I always look forward to that weekend because I know what a difference it will make.</p>
<p class="indentpara">One more thing I did that made a huge difference was hire a <span id="page_139">biweekly</span> housekeeper. Confession: Cleaning is not one of my strengths. And to be honest, I just don’t like it. I made some small changes and created room in my budget to hire help in this area, and it’s been so worth it! If you love cleaning, that’s great (I really wish I did). Some people find it meditative. But if you don’t, hiring help is well worth the investment. I consider it an important part of self-care. After all, clean spaces are a big joy-booster.</p>
<p class="indentpara1">We all have our own ideas about what we can do in our spaces to make them more nurturing, beautiful, and organized, but sometimes life can get in the way. What I’d like to do in this chapter is <span id="page_140">inspire</span> you to link your spaces with your levels of happiness, energy, and success on a daily basis. They are directly connected, and when we recognize this, they become much higher priorities. Our outer world truly does reflect our inner world and vice versa.</p>
<p class="indentpara">You can begin working on three areas that can apply to all your spaces and are also ongoing efforts: Clear spaces of clutter, clear spaces of energy-draining objects, and examine the colors in your spaces to see if you can make changes in paint or other features that will bring a happier feel. Start with these and then apply some of the more specific ideas I share in this chapter that resonate with you, along with any inspiring ideas you come up with.</p>
<p class="indentpara1">As you go through this process, keep in mind that these changes don’t have to be expensive. In fact, it’s worth noting that the biggest positive change will actually come from what you <em>remove</em>. There’s really something to be said for having less—less to take care of and less to feel enclosed by. You want to own your stuff, not the other way around.</p>

<p class="subhead2">Questions to Get You Thinking</p>
<p class="leftpara1">Aligning your living spaces with your best life takes effort, but the effort pays off in amazingly powerful ways. As we cover some ideas for adding sparkle to your spaces, keep these questions in mind.</p>
<p class="hanging1"><span class="C420">•</span>Does your living environment reflect who you are and what you want?</p>
<p class="hanging1"><span class="C420">•</span>Do your bedroom, bathroom, kitchen, and work spaces make you feel peaceful and supported in the best possible ways?</p>
<p class="hanging1"><span class="C420">•</span>Are there things in your spaces that drain your energy, such as clothing you never wear, needless clutter, furniture or knickknacks you don’t need or love, or projects you know you’re never going to get to?</p>
<p class="hanging1"><span class="C420">•</span>When you wake up in the morning, do you feel surrounded by comfort, positive energy, and small reminders that inspire motivation and creativity?</p>
<p class="hanging1"><span class="C420">•</span>Are your spaces filled with colors, meaningful objects, and scents that lift you up?</p>
</div>
<p class="subhead"><strong>THE INSPIRED BEDROOM</strong></p>
<p class="justifypara">A few simple little things I do for myself make such a difference in the first moments of my day that I’m constantly feeling grateful for these small efforts. I always have a glass of water on my nightstand—without fail. I always keep my robe on the bed at my feet so it’s warm and waiting for me the moment I get up. I have my thermostat programmed to come on at 4:00 a.m. to adjust my home to the temperature I like to wake up to. These may sound <span id="page_141">trivial,</span> but to me, they’re reminders that I’m supported and cared for, so I not only benefit from their convenience but from the loving energy they create.</p>
<p class="indentpara">What you keep by your bedside matters. Objects that make you feel peaceful or inspired, contribute to your comfort (such as lip balm), or remind you of the goals you have are great. As I mentioned earlier, I have a favorite framed quote on my nightstand (which I printed out from my computer) along with eyedrops, a candle, and a basket of inspiring books and magazines I love to read. Put some thought into how you might customize your nightstand and bedside to inspire you, lift you up, and make your life a little easier.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Your bedroom is very likely your most sacred personal space. It should radiate peaceful, renewing energy and be free of needless junk. Your bed, sheets, and pillows should be so ridiculously comfortable that it makes you giddy every time you crawl in. You deserve to go to sleep—and wake up—in a place that feels majestic, indulgent, and healthy. Give yourself (and your partner, if you share a bedroom) this gift.</p>
<p class="subhead"><strong>THE BLISSFUL BATHROOM</strong></p>
<p class="justifypara">Let’s talk about your bathroom. It’s the first room you usually head to after getting up. And we spend way more time in our bathrooms than we realize. Did you know that a person who lives to be seventy-five will spend an average of a year and a half in the bathroom? (For some of us girls, it’s probably more like three years!) That’s a lot of time to spend in a space you don’t absolutely love!</p>
<p class="indentpara">Is your bath decorated in a way that makes you feel uplifted and at peace? I have a canvas hanging in my bathroom that was given to me by a dear friend. It reads, “There is happiness to be found in every moment.” That happy reminder is the first thing that greets me when I enter the space. I also keep scented soy candles, my <span id="page_142">favorite</span> natural soaps, and big piles of fluffy white towels handy. All this sets the tone for the kinds of days I want to create.</p>
<p class="indentpara5">Here are a few of my favorite tips for a more inspired, organized bathroom.</p>
<p class="hanging4"><span class="C561">•</span>If it’s not beautiful or necessary, it goes. (This actually applies to all spaces.)</p>
<p class="hanging4"><span class="C561">•</span>If it’s expired, it goes. All outdated products are clutter without exception. (Apply this one to your kitchen, too.)</p>
<p class="hanging4"><span class="C561">•</span>If it’s in your way, out it goes. It can be tempting to cram things into small spaces like bathrooms, but if you’re bumping into it or tripping over it, what’s the point? Lose it.</p>
<p class="hanging4"><span class="C561">•</span>Examine the lighting. Get as much natural light as possible in the morning to energize you, especially in your bathroom. If your bathroom is on the darker side, consider adding a window or a skylight—worthy investments, trust me. High-quality lightbulbs that mimic natural light are also great.</p>
<p class="hanging4"><span class="C561">•</span>Consider getting a dimmer. Adding a dimmer to your light switch is an inexpensive way to add a little luxury to the space. This is one of my favorite little improvements to any room in a home.</p>
<p class="hanging4"><span class="C561">•</span>Invest in super-comfy, high-quality towels—a must.</p>
<p class="indentpara">When I bought my current house, the bathroom was a real eyesore. It was outdated, dark, and lacked storage. I got creative, and for under two hundred dollars, I transformed it into a beautiful little sanctuary. Paint had a huge impact for the dollar, and hanging a sheer, white shower curtain to let the light in completely brightened it up. I added inexpensive shelves, a light switch dimmer, scented candles, cozy new towels in a wicker basket, a potted orchid—and it was a whole new world in there without draining my energy or my bank account. Gotta love that!</p>
<p class="subhead"><strong><span id="page_143">THE</span> KIND KITCHEN</strong></p>
<p class="justifypara">Since we’ve already covered the core places to begin, and I’m a fan of simplicity, I’ll just share with you my favorite easy tips for making your kitchen more supportive of your mornings so you can keep up the momentum with your sacred space makeovers.</p>
<p class="indentpara5">Keep in mind that all these points I’m offering aren’t rules, just happiness-inspiring ideas and suggestions. Take the ones that vibe with you, add a few of your own, and feel free to ignore the rest. Here are my favorite difference-makers in the kitchen.</p>
<p class="hanging4"><span class="C561">•</span>Wake up prepared. If you’re a coffee-drinker, create a new habit of setting your coffeemaker up before you go to bed. This is a little gift you can give to yourself every day. Waking up to the coffee already waiting for you (or when all you have to do is push a button) is a beautiful thing.</p>
<p class="hanging4"><span class="C561">•</span>Switch up your breakfast staples. Take some ideas from <a href="16_CHAPTER_7__The_Love_Centered_Die.xhtml#page_117">Chapter 7</a> and keep healthy, super-simple breakfast bites on hand so it’s as easy as possible for you to reach for things that will energize and nourish your body.</p>
<p class="hanging4"><span class="C561">•</span>Have less stuff. The kitchen tends to be one of the most cluttered spaces in the home. The less you have in there, the less you’ll have to clean and maintain, and the more peaceful it will feel. Focus on having fewer dishes, utensils, and knickknacks. In fact, go as minimal as you can bear here. This also makes it much easier to find things when you need them. Get a big box and fill it with items to sell or donate to charity. Anything you don’t use, any duplicates, anything you don’t like looking at: It all goes.</p>
<p class="hanging4"><span class="C561">•</span>Focus on lighting. Just as in other spaces, lighting is important. If you have dated fluorescent lighting in your kitchen, it’s worth the investment to change it out. A dimmer is especially useful in <span id="page_144">the</span> kitchen so you can avoid being hit with super-bright light early in the mornings.</p>
<p class="hanging4"><span class="C561">•</span>Think bright! Bright colors are uplifting in any space. As beautiful as some dark kitchens look in design magazines, they don’t inspire happy feelings or reflect light the way lighter, cooler colors do. When choosing colors for any space, consider first what makes you <em>feel</em> good, then go from there.</p>
<p class="indentpara">There’s one more thing you can do here that works in all spaces, but especially well in the kitchen. Stand in the center of the room, close your eyes, and let it speak to you. Ask what it needs to inspire and support you, let your soul deliver the answers, and then take action. For me, my soul always calls for lots of natural light, soft fabrics, beautiful plants, and organized storage.</p>
<p class="subhead"><strong>SOULFUL WORK SPACES</strong></p>
<p class="justifypara">Soon after I started making over my mornings, I realized just how important a beautiful, inspiring work space is for overall happiness, energy levels, and success. I’d do all these good things in the morning only to have my great energy slightly deflate as soon as I got into my office, usually before 9:00 a.m. It’s not that my office was messy or even unattractive. It was just “blah.” There really wasn’t anything special to make me feel energized or give me a sense of creative inspiration.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Like my bathroom makeover, my office makeover wasn’t expensive or even extensive. I added some cheerful yellow accents, a small altar filled with meaningful objects, some framed photos and quotes, a few plants for a natural element and to clean the air, and a cozy throw to hang on the back of my chair. I also replaced the lightbulbs in my office with full-spectrum bulbs to expand the natural light. The improvement these small changes made was huge and totally worth the effort.</p>
<p class="indentpara"><span id="page_145">Take</span> a look around your work space and see how you can personalize it, add comfort, and elevate the overall feel. Know which colors energize you and incorporate them with fabrics, paint, pillows, and useful objects. Spending just a day doing this will change how you experience all future days in the space.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Also think about ways you can take a more organized, soulful approach to electronic interaction. Old e-mails, documents, and files on your computer are digital forms of clutter. They’re energy-drainers that can secretly zap your motivation, not to mention slow down your computer. Don’t save e-mails longer than a week or two, unsubscribe from newsletters you don’t read, and review the settings in your e-mail application to see if some small tweaks may help you sort or filter your e-mail with greater ease. And definitely turn off that distracting <em>ding</em> sound on your computer that signifies when e-mails come in.</p>
<p class="indentpara">I’m a little embarrassed to share with you that at the time I started making all these great changes to my work space, my inbox contained more than ten thousand old e-mails. Ten thousand! There was junk in there that was three years old. I have no idea how it got to that point or why I had a strange attachment to them, but when I saw the craziness of it, it was easy to let them go and not allow it to happen again.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Finally, remember that a huge percentage of e-mails are from other people wanting something from you. E-mails can be little data-driven soul-suckers. So can text messages and social media messages. While, of course, electronic communication serves a purpose, always know that <em>your</em> agenda comes first and align your day that way.</p>
<p class="indentpara">It’s so easy to get caught up in the electronic wants and needs of others before taking care of your own goals and desires for the day. Before you know it, it’s noon. Don’t get pulled into that unproductive cycle. When I get into my office, I take thirty minutes to quickly answer e-mails and check social media. Then I <span id="page_146">schedule</span> myself an uninterrupted two to three hours to work on my priorities and projects. This helps me use my most valuable time of the day (mornings) on the things that most need my concentration and creative energy (like writing this book). And it feels damn good!</p>
<p class="subhead"><strong>SACRED LITTLE HIDEAWAYS</strong></p>
<p class="justifypara">A quiet, peaceful spot to sit and read, meditate, have a soulful conversation, or just breathe for a few minutes is an important element of self-care and another brick in your happiness foundation. If you ask me, it’s a must—especially in the morning when it’s vital to consciously set outlook and intentions for the day. Our souls long for it, which is why our hearts swoon a bit when we see images on social media of beautiful bistro tables decorated with lattes and flowers. Stepping away from the places you spend the most time and into a beautiful spot that your mind associates with renewal creates a needed shift that helps you to clear your thoughts and touch base with your inner voice.</p>
<p class="indentpara">You don’t need a big area to create your sacred hideaway space. All you need is a simple chair and table under a tree, or a quiet, cozy place in your home where you can chill out and reflect. Even a repurposed closet or the bathroom works in a pinch; just add some mood lighting and stream some soft music on your phone. As long as it gives you the feeling of distraction-free peace for a few minutes, it will work.</p>
<p class="indentpara">I have a friend who has a beautiful potting bench in her garage for planting flowers, crafting, and daydreaming. She takes her tea out there each morning for a couple of minutes to think about how she’d like the day ahead to unfold. It’s quiet, inspiring, and fuels her spirit for the day.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Personally, I’m drawn to the outdoors. At my little urban farm in L.A., I’ve added a healing herb garden, a meditation area, and a cozy seating spot under a giant ash tree in a corner of the property. <span id="page_147">The</span> spot under the ash tree is a place where I go just to sit and dream, be creative, and contemplate. It’s also the perfect spot to have a cold drink and let my mind wander.</p>
<p class="indentpara">If you don’t already have one, how can you create a sacred little getaway spot to dream, rest, and renew? You most likely have everything you need to do this. Identifying and clearing the space, relocating a few objects, and adding a few inspired elements will get you there. Happy dreaming.</p>
<p class="subhead"><strong>CREATING YOUR IMMEDIATE-ACTION LIST</strong></p>
<p class="justifypara">I hope this section on making over your mornings has inspired you to create some radical, soul-inspired changes. Not only will all this action make your mornings and overall life drastically more joyful and successful but it will also create a flow of great reminders that you’re taken care of, that you’re making yourself and your desires a priority, and that you deserve amazing things.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Mornings are the catalyst for the kind of life we want to live. It’s all about starting there with tangible, positive shifts, then taking the practices and tools that work for you and incorporating them into other areas of your days. When you do this, the sun will not just rise and shine brighter on your mornings, it will rise and shine brighter over your entire life. If you’re like me, it just may be the biggest thing that will lead you to the happiness breakthroughs you’ve been longing for. And that, my beautiful, amazing friend, is everything.</p>
