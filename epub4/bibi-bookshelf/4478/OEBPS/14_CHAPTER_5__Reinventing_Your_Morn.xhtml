<p class="chhead2">Reinventing Your Morning Routine</p>
<p class="justifypara"><span class="fontsize">I can vividly remember</span> one stressful morning several years ago that, sadly, was somewhat typical for me at that time. I was awake staring at the clock at 3:17 a.m. My mind was spinning. An 8:00 a.m. meeting with a possible new PR client was looming, and I’d barely slept. Rampant thoughts were running through my head. <em>I want to wear that black wrap dress, but did I pick it up from the cleaners? I can’t remember. Damn, it might rain, and if it does, traffic will be a nightmare. This comforter is so freakin’ hot! I’m thirsty, but if I get up now, I’ll never get back to sleep. This sucks.</em> Somehow, I did manage to drift back to sleep for a while.</p>
<p class="indentpara">The alarm woke me at 6:00 a.m.; its well-meaning, cheerful chimes were an unwelcome irritation. I sat up in the bed, trying to muster the motivation to hop to it. <em>Ugh!</em> I thought, as I realized it was indeed raining outside. I had less than an hour to get out the door.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Knowing I needed to leave at least a half-hour earlier because of the rain, I rinsed birdbath-style in the shower but didn’t wash my hair. Instead I threw it into a ponytail, wrapped myself in a towel, and started to rifle through my closet for the black dress I wanted to wear. It was still at the cleaners. I put on a “plan B” dress, which I didn’t feel my best in, but I knew it would work.</p>
<p class="indentpara"><span id="page_96">As</span> I finished getting ready, I realized I was battling the clock. No time to drink coffee or eat. How I wished I had a Starbucks barista in the house in that moment. I jetted out the door without a moment to spare.</p>
<p class="indentpara">A few minutes later, sitting in the usual gridlocked L.A. traffic, I started to breathe a little better, realizing I was on my way and telling myself I could hit a drive-thru after the meeting for coffee and food. I was reaching for the radio to catch the news when I realized with horror that I’d left the sticky note with the address for the meeting on it sitting on my desk. “You can’t be serious!” I screamed at the top of my lungs, blood rushing into my cheeks. I must have frightened the guy sitting next to me in traffic.</p>
<p class="indentpara">I took a breath and sat in silence for a minute, inching along in the rain with no way in sight to exit the freeway, and started to quietly whimper. I’d had it.</p>
<p class="indentpara">I knew that I’d be very late at this point, and that even if I could make it on time, I was in no mental state to deliver a presentation to a new client. I left a message saying something had come up and I needed to reschedule. Relieved, I headed back home.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Looking back on that hectic morning, and the rampant mediocrity of my mornings overall back then, I clearly see how I was not only responsible for the way it all went, but I actually created it! The way I was choosing to live my mornings was the primary cause of so much of the stress, anxiety, and depleted joy levels. My own lack of a supportive morning routine combined with occasional poor planning was causing me to start many days running on empty.</p>
<p class="indentpara">You don’t have to have mornings as hectic as that one for them to negatively affect your life. The all-too-common hurried, slightly stressed, mentally-repeating-the-day’s-to-do-list kind of mornings are sneaky. They seem okay, but they’re really draining your energy and joy rather than serving as the incredible fuel they could be. Mediocrity in this area, or any area, doesn’t work when it comes to creating the life you desire. The goal is to create shifts to your mornings so they can be the most powerful, supportive fuel for your happiest, most successful life—like filling the gas tank, rotating the <span id="page_97">tires,</span> and changing the oil in your car before a road trip.</p>
<p class="indentpara">When I changed my mornings, the positive impact on my entire life was immediate. I’ve never looked back. As a result, I consistently have so much more energy, peace, clarity. My morning routine is the sacred firewood that ignites my life.</p>
<p class="justifypara1">The first couple of hours of each day are when I apply a large percentage of my planning, deliberate positive thinking, and healthy practices. These are key areas to focus on that have the most impact. We’ve covered morning thoughts (the number-one area to work on), and now we’ll dig further into adjusting routine, improving sleep, busting anxiety, eating super-powered happiness foods, and creating spaces that support happiness. This stuff is not only life changing—it’s also fun! We’re going to be creative and get you trying out some new things, and who doesn’t love that?</p>
<p class="indentpara">Taking an honest look at how your mornings currently unfold is a great place to start. Then, you’ll be in a great place to begin a morning makeover. This simple questionnaire I’ve created for you will help you answer some important questions about how you’re starting your day and get a better picture of where you could make your first changes. You can fill it in here, or if you’d like, I’ve created a printable download (along with some other helpful tools) on my Web site at <a href="http://kristiling.com/operationhappinessresources">kristiling.com/operationhappinessresources</a>. Ready for your morning makeover? Let’s get started. Remember, the idea is to go from <em>tolerating</em> to <em>enjoying</em> on all levels.</p>
<p class="subhead"><strong>TIME IS ON YOUR SIDE (IF YOU ALLOW IT TO BE)</strong></p>
<p class="justifypara">Let’s talk about how much time you have to get ready in the morning. This is an area where most of us can use improvement. I was <em>so</em> guilty <span id="page_98">of</span> the morning rush for so long! Even if you’re waking up and giving yourself plenty of time to get ready and out the door on time, are you allowing yourself the luxury of a little extra time to read a motivating article, meditate or enjoy some stillness (even for a couple of minutes), lovingly connect in a meaningful way with a pet or family member, or step outside for some healing deep breaths of fresh air?</p>
<p class="indentpara">I get up much earlier than I need to each morning because I value that time so much. And if I have to be at the airport or an early appointment, I figure out what time I think I need to be up and set the alarm on my phone for thirty minutes earlier than that. Once I’m up and moving, I thank myself every time.</p>
<p class="indentpara">To start adding more “you time” to your mornings, try setting <span id="page_100">your</span> alarm to wake you up just fifteen minutes earlier than you usually do. It may take a few days to adjust, but it’s so worth it. And whatever you do, avoid that surly snooze button—it’s not your friend.</p>
<p class="indentpara">If fifteen minutes seems like a challenge, start with five and work up to fifteen. Even just five extra minutes in the morning can make a big difference, especially if you have kids that will need your attention. These little slices of your time are a basic element in creating more happiness and balance. They can really amp up your sense of harmony and empowerment. Setting aside just five minutes of stillness and quiet in the morning to connect with yourself, your spirit, and your life is immensely powerful and clarifying.</p>
<p class="indentpara1">And on that note, I’ll mention that giving yourself five extra minutes in many areas of your life is an amazingly powerful practice. I actually work to be five minutes early whenever possible, wherever I’m going. It gives me time to sit and chill out for a few minutes before an appointment, and if some unexpected obstacle pops up on my way (like traffic), it gives a cushion that takes away so much stress. It’s kind of amazing how much drama this small change has zapped from my life. It’s a small shift that makes a big difference.</p>

<p class="indentpara6">If you answered <em>no</em> or <em>could do better</em> on four or more of the questions, you’re definitely in need of a few positive changes. Even if your answers were mostly <em>yes</em>, you’ll likely find some ideas and suggestions in this section that will help you take your mornings to a new level.</p>
<p class="indentpara7">If you’re beginning to realize you could use some reorganizing and rethinking to get your days started in a happier, more supportive way, the rest of this section will offer solutions and ideas to help create more joyful, organized mornings that will lead you into more empowered days.</p>
</div>
<p class="subhead1"><strong>How to Best Manage Your Time</strong></p>
<p class="justifypara">Let’s chat for a bit about time management. I’d like to share three of the best time-management tips I’ve picked up along my path. They not only apply to your mornings but will support you in many other areas of your life. These tips are awesome and may even surprise you. Truly, sometimes you can actually get more done (and better!) by doing less, because you’ll be focused on your most important priorities with fewer distractions and less stress. Think of great time-management practices as an important part of the skill of happiness. They’ll not only create more breathing room, they’ll help you direct your precious energy to the things that are truly important to you (and make it easier to ditch the rest).</p>
<p class="indentpara"><strong>Be mindful about multitasking.</strong> Mornings are prime time for multitasking, but believe it or not, it’s not always productive or help<span id="page_101">ful.</span> I used to be the queen of multitasking, but I’ve since realized that it was not serving me the way I thought it was. In fact, it was holding me back and taking away from my enjoyment of little things.</p>
<p class="indentpara">When we’re multitasking, we’re not fully present for any of the tasks we’re trying to accomplish. It’s best not to multitask on anything you wish to give your full attention to. I enjoy making coffee in the morning—I find the process meditative and relaxing. So, I don’t do anything else at the same time. If you have kids, try being fully present while getting them ready, rather than checking social media or throwing in loads of laundry. The joy you’ll get from that couple of minutes of quality time is so much more valuable than the minute or two you save by multitasking.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Examine where you multitask and ask yourself if it’s supportive or draining, and then make changes accordingly. Try creating a list of areas in your life where you know you multitask, then mark each one as either supportive or draining. Some examples: Brushing your teeth in the shower (supportive and time-saving). Doing squats while brushing your teeth (supportive and . . . awesome!). Making breakfast while checking e-mail (draining). Talking on the phone while picking out your clothes (draining—and may result in some scary fashion choices you’ll regret later in the day).</p>
<p class="indentpara"><strong>Slow down.</strong> It may seem counterproductive when it comes to time management, but believe it or not, slowing down just a little in everything you do can actually be a time-saver and help you be more on target, as well as allow you to be more present in everything. And presence is a major happiness booster.</p>
<p class="justifypara1">Simply slowing down helps prevent lost keys, forgotten coats, and even injury. Honestly, every time I can remember being injured <span id="page_102">over</span> the past few years, it was because I was going too fast. A couple years ago, I was loading some things into the back of a friend’s Jeep. I was moving so quickly (for no good reason) that I didn’t notice the back hatch hadn’t gone up all the way due to a faulty spring. I stood up full speed right into it, gaining me a trip to my local urgent-care center, where the doctor put eight staples into my melon. Fun. I realized that night I’d been moving way too fast across the board for some time and received the smack on my head as a message to slow way down.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Slowing down in general brings a sense of more peace, clarity, and mindfulness to everything we do. It’s not just about presence, but pleasure as well. It helps you savor moments, create more joyful memories, and notice beautiful details in the <em>now</em> that might otherwise have been overlooked in your hurriedness. It makes a huge difference in your overall quality of life. Go slower. Learn to pause more. Step off the hamster wheel. Take time to breathe.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Try creating a list of ways you could slow down and how it might make a positive difference in your day. Perhaps you might carve out an extra couple of minutes to enjoy your breakfast, or give yourself extra time to style your hair. Even the smallest things can make a big difference.</p>
<p class="indentpara"><strong>Chunk your time.</strong> Divide your time into bite-size increments to dedicate fully to each task. Give yourself loving permission to unplug from distractions and focus on only one task during each section of time without being pulled in a million different directions. This is a huge stress-buster and is actually a major time-saver. For example, I set aside a few hours this morning to work on this book. From 7:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m, I’m doing nothing but writing this section about how to make time work in our favor. By setting my goal (1,200 words for today) and allowing a chunk of time to give it complete focus, I’ll have no problem getting it done. It’s not just drive and enthusiasm that make great things happen, it’s also focus and presence.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Setting aside specific sections of time is also a great way to plan <span id="page_103">out</span> amazingly supportive mornings. How long do you want to sit and enjoy your coffee or tea or stretch or move your body? Chunking some time for this (even just a couple of minutes) guarantees you get that precious, soulful time and also makes it guilt-free (the best part). You can apply this same idea to getting dressed, reading something uplifting, caring for loved ones, checking e-mails and social media, and making sure you have time to nourish your body and spirit. It works great for getting things done at the office, too.</p>
<p class="indentpara">How many times can we remember thinking at the end of a day, <em>Wow, I was super-busy today, but it doesn’t seem like I got much done! This</em> method is the way to get things done and reduce busyness. A win-win!</p>
<p class="indentpara">Here’s a chart that will give you a snapshot of what a typical morning could look like if you had ninety minutes from the time you woke up until you needed to be out the door. You can chunk your time so you can fully focus and enjoy each activity. This is just an example, but I do recommend sketching out a custom chart like this for yourself based on your own needs.</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="" class="Image157" src="img/120_1.jpg" width="100%"/></p>
<p class="subhead"><strong><span id="page_104">SMALL</span> SHIFTS, BIG RESULTS</strong></p>
<p class="justifypara">Making over your mornings, and any other area of life, is all about small shifts, big results. So that’s what we’re creating here: Small changes that, with practice and dedication, will result in powerful positive change. Try the ideas and suggestions that feel good and doable to you, along with a few of your own, and you’ll notice an immediate difference in the quality of your days. As soon as you begin, you’ll notice your outlook, energy levels, and overall state of mind will be bumped up a notch.</p>
<p class="indentpara">It’s a great idea to get started right away (if you haven’t already) on creating the changes you know will improve your mornings in big ways. Starting now with small steps will get the ball rolling and create momentum to go a bit deeper, which we’ll be doing in the next two chapters. There’s so much good stuff still to come. Keep in mind that happiness is a renewable resource, and mornings are the best place to keep it renewed!</p>
