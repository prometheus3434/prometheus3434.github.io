<p class="chhead2">The Love-Centered Diet: Eating to Support Your Happiest, Healthiest Life</p>
<p class="justifypara"><span class="fontsize">When I think about</span> the junk I used to put into my poor body, I cringe. For years, I ate fast food, drank too much, and overloaded on sugar without any idea what it was doing to my body, my mind, or my spirit. It didn’t occur to me until later in life that all that toxic eating was directly linked to my anxiety, illness, and bouts of depression—not to mention the primary cause of the frustrating fatigue I experienced all through my twenties.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Our bodies are our ultimate source of renewable energy. They are beautiful miracles made up of trillions of tiny little universes called cells that rely solely on our love, support, and nurturing to thrive, and in return, support us in this life. I can’t imagine a person on this earth whose body is not their single most prized possession, yet rare is the person who remembers this daily and lives in alignment with that priority.</p>
<p class="indentpara">This chapter is not your typical chapter on nutrition, health, and diet. It’s a delicious little journey into shifting the way we make everyday choices, including food choices. It’s not about a standard diet plan either, but rather a simple, mindful, love-centered, holistic lifestyle <span id="page_118">practice</span> that can change the way we view the foods we’re choosing and influence other choices we make—as we’re making these choices. This makes it infinitely easier to pass up things that don’t support our happiness and true desires for our best life and create the space to invite in more of those foods (and other things) that do.</p>
<p class="indentpara">I’m beyond excited to share this with you, because in its great simplicity lies tremendous transformational power. A small mindset shift is all it takes to open up a new, empowering way to make even the smallest choices that impact your health, energy, and life.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Millions of people have been searching for decades for a miracle pill that will help them have more energy, release excess weight, and feel healthier when, in reality, this simple, mindful lifestyle path is the miracle they truly need. It’s a powerful practice based on self-love that greatly strengthens our willpower and desire to make incredibly healthy, energizing choices like never before. A truly Love-Centered Diet.</p>
<p class="indentpara">I believe the weight-loss and health-care industries have something largely backward. Most of them tell people that if they lose weight, they’ll feel great, look great, be healthier and happier, and have boundless energy. They work to convince us that we need whatever it is they’re selling so we can lose the weight and achieve those desired results. Here’s my question: What if we reverse it? I believe that if we consciously focus our efforts and choices first on just the desired results of being healthier and happier, feeling great, loving ourselves more, and having incredible energy—and we make those goals a top priority through radical self-care and choices aligned with these desires—our beautiful, intelligent, responsive bodies will feel safe to naturally seek out and maintain a healthy weight.</p>
<p class="indentpara">The fitness and weight-loss industries are correct that what we eat and drink and how much we move our bodies has an impact on what kind of physical and emotional shape we’re in. But all that is part of simply loving ourselves and making definitive choices that support the amazing lives we desire and deserve.</p>
<p class="subhead"><strong><span id="page_119">MEET</span> ME AT SUNRISE</strong></p>
<p class="justifypara">The way you nourish your body in the morning drastically affects your entire day and, therefore, your life, which is why I chose to include this chapter in the section about making over your mornings. Mornings are where it all begins.</p>
<p class="indentpara">When we make powerful, nutrition-rich choices in the morning, it gives us the energy and mental clarity we need to create our best possible day. It also tends to set us on a great path to make healthier choices throughout the rest of the day, similar to the way we don’t want to mess up the house right after we’ve spent hours cleaning it.</p>
<p class="indentpara">I’d like to share what led me to conceive and fall so madly in love with this Love-Centered Diet concept, while explaining the powerful mind-set shift and practice that is the heart of how it works. It’s all based on one magical, potent question.</p>
<p class="subhead1"><strong>Powerful Question, Big Results</strong></p>
<p class="justifypara">A while back, I was sitting in my studio one sunny afternoon working on a blog post about the power of our choices—how being intensely conscious about making choices that align with our hearts’ true desires can change the course of our lives and light the path to everything we dream of. As I was writing, I thought, what if we asked ourselves <em>this</em> question before we make each choice, small or large: Is this choice in alignment with my heart’s true desires for my best life?</p>
<p class="justifypara1"><span id="page_120">A</span> breeze was softly blowing through the curtains behind my desk, and my dogs, Venus and Ellis, were sleeping in the corner, enjoying every minute of this perfectly peaceful day. It dawned on me then how truly life changing this simple question can be when we dedicate ourselves to passionately putting it into practice on a consistent basis.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Of course, we all try, for the most part, to make choices that line up with what we want, but we don’t always stop to check in with our inner voices and truly consider things on a holistic level. So many small choices, especially those involving food and our health, are made to gain instant gratification rather than to achieve the desired big-picture effect. This can cause us to go through life suffering from cumulative damage to our bodies, minds, and spirits without being clear on where it came from!</p>
<p class="indentpara">When we create a habit of pausing, just briefly, before each choice, each <em>yes</em>, and each commitment to ask ourselves, “Is this choice in alignment with my heart’s true desires for my best life?”—and then allow ourselves to be guided by the answer we receive—everything changes.</p>
<p class="indentpara">That afternoon, when I was considering all the areas to which this simple, mindful practice of checking in with our true desires can apply, it occurred to me that this concept could be easily laser focused and applied to the foods we choose, how we nourish ourselves, and the things we do that support or detract from our health. A love-centered way of eating and nurturing our bodies and spirits based on self-love, desire, self-compassion, and mindfulness empowers us to be the best we can be. It’s a powerful tool—and lifestyle—that can give us the authority to let go of our struggles when making choices and habits that affect our health. A Love-Centered Diet sounds inviting, right?</p>
<p class="indentpara">When we connect the dots between the results we’ll get from the choice we’re about to make with the bigger picture of our deepest desires for our lives, suddenly making the very best, most incredible choices becomes much easier. The things we thought we <span id="page_121">wanted</span> and were tempted to impulsively consume become the last things we crave. And the things that will actually support our true desires begin to shine brightly and call for us to reach for them more often. Some even taste better! Seriously, the idea of kale used to seem too “blah” to me, but I love it now. I even crave it! Six years ago, if you’d told me I’d be craving foods like kale salad and green smoothies, I’d have rolled on the floor laughing.</p>
<p class="indentpara">The beautiful thing is that there are no extremes here. It’s not about being perfect. There really aren’t any rules. It’s not about counting calories or carbs. It’s simply about shifting to live from a place of heightened awareness and following the whisper of your heart to make higher-quality choices that align with the big picture of what you truly desire for your life.</p>
<p class="indentpara">This heightened awareness around your nutrition and health not only includes having more physical energy, being at a healthier weight, and feeling your best, but it also involves a balance of things that add to your joy and sense of pleasure. So on occasion, a few bites of that crazy-delicious-looking dessert or extra vanilla latte might just qualify as aligning with your heart’s desire, as long as it’s not overdone. When you’re tuned in, your heart will always tell you where the balance is.</p>
<p class="indentpara">That same afternoon, I decided to try the Love-Centered Diet and create the habit of always checking in with myself before eating, drinking, or making other lifestyle choices that would impact my health. I needed a practice to add to my happiness foundation that would help me easily stay on track in this area, and something told me this was it. It’s simple and full of positivity—and I’m a huge fan of both!</p>
<p class="indentpara">I’ve always struggled with food choices. Although it became dramatically better for me when I changed my life for the happier several years back, I still struggled a bit with staying on a healthy track consistently, and definitely still had a hard time keeping sugar to a minimum (cupcakes will get me almost every time). An annoying extra eight pounds also tends to sneak on when I go for long <span id="page_122">periods</span> without paying much attention to my choices (like during the holiday season—ugh!). But that’s just it; this happens when I go for <em>long periods without paying much attention to my choices</em>. Lack of attention to choices is the root of so much mayhem! Reducing instances of lower-quality choices by training myself to thoughtfully check in with my inner voice before each one has helped me create major positive change in this area (and keep that eight pounds away).</p>
<p class="indentpara">Along with heightening awareness of my food choices to be sure they were in line with my desires for my best life, I added in two more elements of physical health where I knew more awareness and higher-quality choices would make a big difference. First, I wanted to begin moving my body more in general. All the writing and online work I do can easily keep me from moving most of the day if I let it, which is a major health- and energy-zapper, and that’s no good. Basically, my goal was just to be more conscious of opportunities to fit in frequent, small slivers of exercise in addition to what I was already getting through yoga and hiking—just stepping it up a bit.</p>
<p class="indentpara">I decided to have a little fun with this goal. So I started dancing while brushing my teeth in the morning (love this one!), choosing to always take the stairs, running around my backyard with my dogs for ten minutes in the afternoon (super-fun), power walking with a girlfriend on a Sunday morning, and other little gems that feel great and could easily fit into my life.</p>
<p class="indentpara">The second was increasing my hydration. I’ll talk about this more shortly, but basically I can’t emphasize enough how important proper hydration is to our overall health, happiness, and energy level.</p>
<p class="indentpara">When I made these small shifts, I began to see immediate, big results. I not only lost that irritating eight pounds and felt better overall, I also felt hugely energized from taking back complete power over my choices, both small and large. I felt a new sense of control and peace—a more enlightened way of being when it comes to nutrition, health, and overall approach to the everyday.</p>
<p class="indentpara">I’ve since created a new habit of aligning my choices across all areas of my life with my heart’s deepest desires. It took a couple <span id="page_123">months</span> of very conscious effort before it came naturally, but once it did . . . what a difference. I allow myself the freedom to not be absolute about it all the time (I believe that being just a little reckless on occasion is part of a happy life), but I’m consistent enough to have seen a major positive impact in my life, and I feel a beautiful energy of living in alignment with my truth.</p>
<p class="subhead1"><strong>My Mother’s Love-Centered Diet</strong></p>
<p class="justifypara">I’ve watched my amazing mom struggle with food, health issues, and weight my entire life. Her struggle has caused her much frustration and heartache over the years. It’s also been heartbreaking for me on many occasions, because when you love someone, you want that person to be happy and healthy.</p>
<p class="indentpara">It all started in her midtwenties, when a number of health issues, along with physical changes from having kids, catapulted her into what would be a decades-long battle.</p>
<p class="indentpara">I remember a time several years back when my mom was looking unwell, frail, and just generally not well. I felt completely freaked out about the state she was in and feared I might lose her within the next few years, which was an unbearable thought. I knew her doctor had recently told her she was in danger and had to make some changes. I called her one night to tell her how I was feeling. I cried and begged her to make drastic changes to turn her health around.</p>
<p class="indentpara">She knew when I called that I was right, and she did begin to take action. Since then, she’s lost enough weight to significantly reduce her risk of major health issues, and she exercises regularly—amazing stuff. She looks and feels better than she has in years. But she still finds it difficult to keep the weight off and regularly feels frustrated. Back when I made that call to her, there was so much loving intention behind it, and it did make a difference, but the one thing I didn’t have to offer then was a specific tool that would give her a solid place to start. But with the Love-Centered Diet, that was about to change.</p>
<p class="indentpara">I was so passionate and enthusiastic about the changes I’d made <span id="page_124">through</span> this new lifestyle, I called my mom to share what I’d been doing. I wanted to see what she thought about a diet concept based on self-love and honoring our true big-picture desires. She was the perfect person to ask, since she’s basically seen, heard, and tried just about everything.</p>
<p class="indentpara">A self-help skeptic, my mom has tried dozens of diets and lifestyle programs over the years, but she’d never tried (or even heard of) anything with this kind of solid mind-body connection, or anything linking higher thoughts to food choices, which is where I believe true success (and health) lives.</p>
<p class="indentpara">I explained to her what I’d been doing and the positive change I’d created in this area, and she was intrigued enough to try it. I suggested that before each food choice she should consciously ask herself if the snack/meal/drink she’s considering is in alignment with her heart’s true desires for her best life, and then listen to her inner voice and choose based on the answers she receives. I also asked her to work toward creating a higher awareness in general around how she was taking care of herself. I wanted her to view hydration, rest, and movement as requirements for creating and living her most incredible life. She was already on a good track with exercise, taking part in light-impact group workouts on a regular basis.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Fourteen days after I outlined the Love-Centered Diet for my mom, she called me, elated. “I tried that thing you shared with me, and I’ve lost seven pounds! It came easily and didn’t even feel like a diet . . . more like just making positive choices!” She felt empowered by the new control she’d found that was driven from a more soulful place, and the way it supported her deepest desires for health, energy, and maintaining a healthy weight. It just felt good.</p>
<p class="subhead1"><strong>Mark’s Love-Centered Diet</strong></p>
<p class="justifypara">A while back, I received a moving e-mail from my old friend Mark that touched my heart. He explained that he’d lacked passion in his life for quite some time and that he felt stuck in a constant quest to find the next activity or big accomplishment that would make him happy and motivate him to take better care of himself. But nothing <span id="page_125">seemed</span> to be working. “I’ve tried sports, clubs, philanthropy, mentorships, games, business . . . nothing is resonating,” he wrote. “So for the last ten years, I’ve been going through the motions of life. I have gained close to a hundred pounds in that time, not from fast food or sugary sodas, but from not participating in life.”</p>
<p class="indentpara"><em>Not participating in life</em>. Those words stung a bit and echoed in my head for quite a while after reading his e-mail. I can remember times when I also felt completely apathetic toward just about everything. Apathy, if you ask me, is a widespread condition as serious as any other state of emotional distress.</p>
<p class="indentpara">The thing about apathy is that many times it goes unnoticed, because people who are living in a state of apathy aren’t necessarily depressed (although it can go hand in hand with depression), and they may not necessarily be unusually stressed or going through any particular hardship. They can simply become disconnected from life, falling into a passive state of going through the motions without much joy, excitement, or drive. They may fall into a place where they believe “that’s just the way life is” or that “life’s an uphill battle” without realizing so much can actually be done to bring light, ease, and excitement back into their world.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Just as with any other situation we’d like to overcome, the way to begin stepping out of apathy or lack of enthusiasm for life is with action. The Love-Centered Diet is a great place to begin, because it’s about mindfully connecting your choices, actions, and self-care to your deepest desires, creating motivation in new ways and igniting greater inner purpose. Radical self-care is an excellent remedy for bringing back mojo.</p>
<p class="indentpara">I scheduled a call with Mark to see how I might be able to help. After he further explained his situation, I shared my mother’s story with him and explained the power of the question “Is this choice in alignment with my heart’s true desires for my best life?”</p>
<p class="indentpara">I asked him to spend a couple of weeks examining his true desires, making his self-care a priority, and thinking of his choices and actions not just as mundane necessities but as powerful building blocks for the amazing life he was imagining.</p>
<p class="indentpara"><span id="page_126">By</span> the time we had our next call a couple of weeks later, Mark had empowered himself with some small but significant changes. “There’s been a definite shift. I’ve been drinking more water, eating better in the mornings, and I signed up for tae kwon do classes. This is really a different way to look at things.” I’d hoped for some small positive changes, but tae kwon do? How awesome!</p>
<p class="indentpara">“What I realized is that I can’t allow my circumstances to run my life,” he added. “I feel much more in control of things.”</p>
<p class="indentpara">Mark was on an incredible new path to creating new priorities and taking new action based on desire and self-care, rather than just going through every day missing the element of purpose. It wasn’t about perfection but instead about love, mindfulness, and sustainable momentum—and therefore brighter days.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Months later, Mark let me know that he was still seeing positive results and continuing to make mindful small changes that were making a difference. He was adding in positive affirmations, cutting back on soda, and even getting excited about planning for his future. Most important, he was beginning to have a renewed vision for possibility in his life.</p>
<p class="subhead1"><strong>The Importance of Love-Centered Foods</strong></p>
<p class="justifypara">Another central building block of the Love-Centered Diet enhances it with even more positive energy and impact: The foods we choose should be produced in alignment with love, compassion, and the highest consideration for our health and the health of the planet.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Choosing foods produced organically and humanely, and supporting companies and farms that operate based on these values, raises the positive energy in our lives (and in the world around us), while ensuring our bodies are receiving the highest possible level of love and nutritional quality. This makes consciousness of not only the type of foods we choose but also the <em>way they are produced</em>, very important because it’s essentially part of ensuring that we stay aligned with our hearts’ deepest desires for our best lives.</p>
<p class="indentpara">All of us want to see animals treated humanely and with love, we all want to do our part to preserve the environment, and I don’t <span id="page_127">think</span> any of us really want to munch on pesticides or other disease-causing chemicals. I believe this is quite universal. Aligning these values with what we consume contributes to raising the vibrations of love, kindness, compassion, and positive energy around all we do—essential bricks in our happiness foundation.</p>
<p class="indentpara">I encourage you to look into what’s available at your local markets, to do some research and grow your knowledge of food production, food ingredients, and farming practices, and read the labels on the foods you currently buy. Use all the information you empower yourself with to see how you can make some positive shifts to more love-centered foods and raise the quality of the impact you have on the planet as a human. It’s not about being perfect or extreme; it’s more about making changes in ways that are doable and available to you.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Creating great energy around what we eat supports our physical and spiritual wellness, along with the health and happiness of the planet and all its majestic life. You’ll feel great knowing that what you’re consuming comes from loving, positive sources, and you’ll be supporting farms and businesses that share the same values. It’s a high-impact win-win.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Few things elevate happiness levels more than knowing you’re making a positive difference in the world, in the lives of others, and in your own life. Choosing love-centered foods is a way to cover all those bases with grace, love, and compassion.</p>
<p class="subhead"><strong>CHOOSING FOODS THAT SUPPORT YOUR HAPINESS, ENERGY, AND SUCCESS</strong></p>
<p class="justifypara">Choosing foods and creating health practices based on self-love and your big-picture desires for your life is an incredible part of happiness-centered living. Once you create this new habit, the way you look at the foods you enjoy and other supportive elements of your life will permanently shift. When you begin to prioritize your eating and other health-related activities (such as hydration and movement) according to what will support your happiness, energy, <span id="page_128">and</span> success, positive changes begin immediately and you create a powerful momentum like no other.</p>
<p class="indentpara">You probably have a few super-healthy recipes in your collection that you’d like to make more often. I encourage you to add them to your regular menu. There are so many great resources for healthy recipes: online, books, and even your imagination. Have <span id="page_129">fun</span> with it. Make it an adventure. Change up your regular grocery list according to your new priorities, try new foods, and even seek out a new favorite restaurant that serves organic cuisine.</p>

<p class="indentpara">As you add higher-quality foods to your regular menu, also look to phase out things you’ve been repeating that you know are not in alignment with your best life. Keep in mind that there’s a <span id="page_130">more</span> healthful replacement for just about everything (such as my chocolate ice cream habit that I replaced with dark chocolate–covered almonds), so you don’t have to feel deprived if you get creative. I still get my chocolate fix, just in a higher-quality way. The more you consciously and deliberately indulge in things you enjoy that <em>also</em> support your health, happiness, and heart’s desires, the less you’ll crave or even think about the things that don’t.</p>
<p class="indentpara5">I suggest taking a sheet of paper or your journal and creating a list of foods you love that you know are of high energetic and health value, so you can put them on your shopping list more often and make them part of your routine. In addition to the<a href="#Happiness"> top ten happiness-boosting foods</a>, here are a few of my favorites that are always on my shopping list.</p>
<p class="hanging4"><span class="C561">•</span>Eggs (I buy organic, free-range eggs when my own backyard chickens aren’t laying . . . yes, I raise chickens for eggs and fun—love it!)</p>
<p class="hanging4"><span class="C561">•</span>Frozen organic berries for smoothies (and for using in place of ice to keep drinks cool), especially strawberries (always organic, as nonorganic strawberries are known to contain high levels of pesticides)</p>
<p class="hanging4"><span class="C561">•</span>Granny Smith apples (always organic—these are my secret weapon for banishing belly bloat)</p>
<p class="hanging4"><span class="C561">•</span>Lemons (for cooking and squeezing into water—organic when possible)</p>
<p class="hanging4"><span class="C561">•</span>Pineapple</p>
<p class="hanging4"><span class="C561">•</span>Quinoa</p>
<p class="hanging4"><span class="C561">•</span>Sprouted whole-grain bread</p>
<p class="indentpara1">In addition to making high-quality food choices, I take supplements my doctor recommended for me that I feel support my health and energy levels, including a superfoods-based multivitamin, calcium with vitamin D, omega-3s, and a probiotic. To me, supple<span id="page_131">ments</span> are kind of like insurance: We can hope to get all the nutrition we need from our foods, but realistically, that doesn’t always work out. Do what feels right for you and share your thoughts with your doctor to get a professional opinion, too. In fact, share all the positive changes you’re making with your doctor. It never hurts to affirm these things with people who care, and I guarantee you’ll receive enthusiastic support!</p>

<p class="subhead2"><a id="Happiness"/>The Top Ten Happiness-Boosting Foods</p>
<div class="C563a">
<p class="leftpara2">When it comes to choosing foods that boost happiness, an important connection to make is that everything we eat or drink affects our brain or body function in some way. Many foods not only are healthy but also are scientifically shown to support our physiological happiness-boosting systems.</p>
<p class="indentpara6">Nutrients such as folate, magnesium, vitamin D, calcium, chromium, and omega-3 fatty acids are all known to elevate mood. Some foods are known to boost serotonin, a natural chemical in your body that balances mood, sleep, memory, and a number of other good things. Healthful foods that are naturally high in mood-lifting nutrients are perfect staples to place at the core of your diet.</p>
<p class="indentpara6">Once you zero in on your favorite happiness-boosting foods, it will be easy to reach for them more often. The cool thing is that many of these foods happen to be great tasting, too. I love feeling like I’m indulging a little while eating something super-healthy at the same time. That’s a double happiness moment!</p>
<p class="leftpara3">Here are ten of the top happiness-boosting foods you can add to your regular menu.</p>
<p class="hanging1"><span class="C420">•</span>Almonds (look for dark chocolate–covered almonds for a double happiness lift)</p>
<p class="hanging1"><span class="C420">•</span>Avocado</p>
<p class="hanging1"><span class="C420">•</span>Baked potatoes (white, such as russet)</p>
<p class="hanging1"><span class="C420">•</span>Dark chocolate</p>
<p class="hanging1"><span class="C420">•</span>Greek yogurt (plain or low in sugar; try with fresh berries for an amazing quick breakfast)</p>
<p class="hanging1"><span class="C420">•</span>Leafy greens (especially spinach, kale, or Swiss chard)</p>
<p class="hanging1"><span class="C420">•</span>Mushrooms (shiitake, morel, or chanterelle)</p>
<p class="hanging1"><span class="C420">•</span>Popcorn</p>
<p class="hanging1"><span class="C420">•</span>Roasted pumpkin seeds</p>
<p class="hanging1"><span class="C420">•</span>Wild-caught salmon</p>
<p class="indentpara6">You can find a free downloadable poster of these happiness foods, along with a few more gifts I’ve created for you to go with this book, at <a href="http://kristiling.com/operationhappinessresources">kristiling.com/operationhappinessresources</a>.</p>
<p class="leftpara3">Now that you have a list of happiness-boosting foods to consider, here are a few foods I suggest giving the boot: refined sugar; anything artificial (including coloring and sweeteners); frequent heavy doses of empty carbs (like cereal, pasta, and bread—moderation is okay); all sodas (I love sparkling water flavored with splashes of organic juice instead); processed foods; and . . . anything that generally makes you feel like crap after you eat it. We all have those certain foods we love the taste of but make us feel awful every time we eat them. They’re just not worth the loss of energy.</p>
</div>
</div><p class="subhead1"><strong>Creating Momentum with Morning Food Choices</strong></p>
<p class="justifypara">All meals are important, but breakfast is absolutely your most important meal of the day. <em>Please. Eat. Breakfast.</em></p>
<p class="indentpara">Starting your day by hydrating your body and taking the time to fuel up with nutrient-rich, natural foods is one of the best things you can do in your life to support your happiness, energy levels, and health. It will also help you create positive momentum that will help you stay on track throughout the whole day. Think of it as laying the foundation for a healthy day.</p>
<p class="indentpara">When you’re short on time in the morning, or maybe just aren’t that hungry yet, it’s tempting to put nutrition off until later. Don’t. You can’t afford it if you’re looking to create a fantastic day. When you get up in the morning, your body has gone hours without fuel or hydration. You won’t feel like your best self or have the energy you deserve for the day without giving your cells what they need to function at their highest level. You wouldn’t try to drive your car with an empty fuel tank, right?</p>
<p class="indentpara">Think about what you’re eating in the morning and how you might be able to improve it by reducing sugar and bad fats and eliminating anything processed or artificial. Look to increase plant-based foods and nutritional impact. If you’re already choosing pretty healthy options, think of how you can step it up. Remember, what you consume (both nutritionally and energetically) is the fuel of your life.</p>
<p class="subhead"><strong><span id="page_132">QUICK</span> BREAKFAST OPTIONS THAT WILL MAKE YOU FEEL AWESOME</strong></p>
<p class="justifypara">These are just a few super-easy suggestions to help power up your menu. Everyone’s different, so you may prefer other options, but I wanted to share some of the healthful ways I nourish my cells (and soul). Have fun discovering what works for you, try new things, and create incredible shifts—not just in the morning but also throughout your day.</p>
<p class="hanging4"><span class="C561">•</span>Raw almonds with a banana or apple (or other grab-and-go fruit)</p>
<p class="hanging4"><span class="C561">•</span>Almond butter or avocado on sprouted-grain bread with a piece of fruit</p>
<p class="hanging4"><span class="C561">•</span>Apple and raw trail mix</p>
<p class="hanging4"><span class="C561">•</span>Smoothie with berries, spinach, water, and organic apple juice (see my favorite go-to smoothie recipe, opposite)</p>
<p class="hanging4"><span class="C561">•</span>Fresh berries with nuts</p>

<p class="justifypara">A few years ago, when researching the things that have the biggest impact on mood, I learned just how important hydration is to our happiness. Mild dehydration doesn’t just affect energy levels; it also affects mood, digestion, vitality, circulation, mental clarity, and so many other crucial areas that can drastically take away from our best life when not functioning at optimal levels. Sluggish physical energy, mental function, and circulation can trigger the blues, irritability, and even depression. Hydration is imperative if we want to be at our happiest and function at our highest level.</p>
<p class="indentpara"><span id="page_133">Most</span> people are chronically mildly dehydrated and don’t even realize it. Did you know that even a 1 percent drop in your body’s hydration can reduce your energy level by as much as 10 percent? Ten percent! Nobody wants to spend life running on just 90 percent capacity. Who wants to go through the day with an energy deficit like that? No way! But so many people are doing just that, day after day.</p>
<p class="indentpara">How do you know if you’re mildly dehydrated? Well, by the time you feel thirsty, you’re already mildly dehydrated (at least 1 percent), because our body’s natural thirst sensation doesn’t even kick in until then. For many, simply eliminating the chronic dehydration they weren’t even aware they had can be life altering. It definitely was for me.</p>
<p class="indentpara1">In two 2012 studies (one with healthy men and one with healthy women) conducted at the University of Connecticut’s Human Performance Laboratory, researchers found that mild dehydration (about 1.5 percent) caused adverse effects such as fatigue, tension, headaches, and difficulty with mental tasks in both men and <span id="page_134">women.</span> The studies also showed that dehydration affects men and women differently. The men experienced more difficulty with mental tasks, especially in the areas of vigilance and working memory. The women experienced more adverse changes in mood and symptoms such as anxiety and fatigue. Basically, drinking enough water can help us all to avoid these issues, feel better, and perform better overall. That’s my idea of an energy drink! Drinking enough water does take mindful effort, but the return you get is so worth it. Once you create supportive habits with the goal of staying hydrated, it will come to you with ease.</p>
<p class="indentpara">When I first started my own “Operation Hydration” a few years ago, I created the habit of drinking a glass of water first thing in the morning (extremely important), several glasses throughout the day, and a glass in the evening before bed. I can now really notice a difference in the way I feel if I don’t do this. If I go a few hours without water (I try to avoid this, but it happens on occasion), I chug a glass or two as soon as I have the chance. This single change has made an incredibly powerful difference in my life. I feel better, my skin isn’t as dry, and my energy level is dramatically improved. And I have little, if any, 3:00 p.m. fatigue!</p>
<p class="indentpara">I now combat almost every icky feeling with water. If I’m blue, fatigued, fighting off a bug, had too much wine, stressed . . . whatever it is, water always fits into the equation.</p>
<p class="indentpara">There are many different opinions out there on what kind of water is best. It’s a personal choice, but I go for water produced from a home filtration system. I generally avoid bottled water (not a fan of plastic bottles), and I don’t drink tap water unless I’m desperate, although from what I understand, many cities have very high-quality tap water. I also add lemon to my water much of the time, which adds cleansing elements.</p>
<p class="indentpara1">Water is the ultimate healer and the very best energy drink. I can’t stress hydration enough. It’s one of the simplest resources of all to pump up the volume on health and happiness.</p>

<p class="subhead2">My Happy Fruit and Veggie Smoothie</p>
<p class="hanging6">½ cup wild blueberries (frozen or not)</p>
<p class="hanging6">½ cup organic frozen strawberries</p>
<p class="hanging6">1 banana</p>
<p class="hanging6">1 cup cold-pressed apple juice (organic is best—you can cut sugar by using water in place of juice. I also sometimes use organic carrot juice instead.)</p>
<p class="hanging6">½ to 1 cup water (start with ½ cup and add more, as needed, for desired thickness)</p>
<p class="hanging6">1 handful of organic spinach (blending spinach into a smoothie is a great way to get kids to eat it, too!)</p>

<p class="subhead2"><span id="page_135">Nutrition</span> on the Outside</p>
<p class="leftpara2">High-quality nutrition isn’t just what we’re putting in our bodies; it’s what we’re putting on and around our bodies, too. Several years ago when I started learning about what’s actually in beauty products, personal care products, and cleaning products, two things happened. First, I had to get a handle on my own distress around the fact that some of the stuff is even legal (that’s an entire conversation on its own), and second, I made drastic changes to all the products I use, from makeup to cleaning products. There’s nothing like being freaked out and grossed out at the same time to inspire rapid, positive change.</p>
<p class="indentpara6">Just like with food ingredients and production, I encourage you to protect your health and well-being by examining and learning about the ingredients in the products you use and making shifts that feel right to you. Products produced without harsh chemicals and preservatives but with organic and natural ingredients feel better to use inside and out, and you’ll be reducing your risk of everything from chronic allergies to serious disease. Plus, just as you’ll find that love-centered foods actually <em>taste</em> better, you’ll also find that personal-care and home products made with the same loving qualities actually <em>work</em> better. I’ve also found that they come with the cool bonus of a palatable happy energy.</p>
<p class="leftpara3">The Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization dedicated to protecting human health and the environment, is a fantastic resource to begin learning about what’s in your foods, personal-care products, and other consumer products so you can be empowered with all you need to make more healthful, happy, love-centered choices. Their work in the world is a gift to all of us. You can visit them at <a href="http://ewg.org">ewg.org</a> for some great resources to help you.</p>
