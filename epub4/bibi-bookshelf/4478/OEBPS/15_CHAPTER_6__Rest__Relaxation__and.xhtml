<p class="chhead2">Rest, Relaxation, and Reducing Anxiety</p>
<p class="justifypara"><span class="fontsize">Before we get started,</span> I’d like to share that this chapter, and the next chapter on love-centered eating and wellness, are really applicable to all areas of life, as are many of the ideas I share in this section of the book. However, I believe the first place to begin tackling these things and creating the momentum needed for all positive change is in the morning. Starting each day with a bright scope of supportive practices, mind-sets, and habits that can be carried throughout the whole day and night with ease is the way to the greatest success in so many areas. In this sense, mornings really are the foundation for most everything we wish to heal, feel, or accomplish in our lives.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Anxiety really tends to show up in ways that can put a big damper on our mornings. Much of the time, it creeps in when we’re trying to get to sleep at night, robbing us of needed rest and leading us to wake up exhausted. It also tends to pop up first thing in the morning when we allow worrisome thoughts about the day ahead to get the best of us. This is why the morning is a great place to begin incorporating anxiety-busting practices that help guide us onto a positive track for the day—and evening—ahead.</p>
<p class="subhead"><strong><span id="page_106">REDUCING</span> AND EMBRACING ANXIETY</strong></p>
<p class="justifypara">When I was thirty-one, I found myself suffering from a number of random, annoying health issues, such as insomnia, exhaustion, knots in my stomach much of the time, and just an overall sense of unwellness and stress. I had a doctor at the time whom I adored, and I decided to go see him to share how tired I was of feeling that way. Admittedly, I went to whine, really, but it turned out to be a life-changing visit.</p>
<p class="indentpara">“How long have you been feeling this way?” he asked.</p>
<p class="indentpara">I hadn’t really thought about how long it had been going on. But in that moment, I realized I’d been living in that state on and off for so long, it kind of seemed like the norm to me. “Well, for a while, I guess. Years?” I said, feeling slightly defeated.</p>
<p class="indentpara">“Years?! Has anyone ever told you that this is anxiety? I think it’s a pretty severe case of generalized anxiety disorder. We can work on this; you just need to make some changes.” It was the first time I realized that the worrisome mind-sets and knots in my stomach that were keeping me up at night actually had a specific name.</p>
<p class="indentpara">I hadn’t really thought of anxiety as its own ailment before. I mean, I knew of the word <em>anxiety</em> and thought it was basically just another term for stress. How wrong I was, and my doc was absolutely right. Although they often go hand in hand, stress and anxiety are different. Stress can cause anxiety, but sometimes anxiety just creeps in on its own due to emotional, environmental, or other factors that can be hard to detect. This can seriously deflate our sense of happiness and peace. Anxiety affects most everyone from time to time, and chronic anxiety like I used to have affects millions of people. According to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America, 18 percent of US adults suffer from some kind of anxiety disorder, costing billions each year to treat.</p>
<p class="indentpara">With stress, we’re normally pretty clear on what it is that’s freaking us out—a test, a deadline, a strained relationship. We can <span id="page_107">usually</span> finish the sentence “I’m totally stressed because of ______________________.” With anxiety, we often feel restless and high-strung without immediately knowing why we’re feeling that way, making it harder to fix the problem and feel centered again.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Like stress, anxiety has an acute adverse effect on our quality of life. Sometimes it’s situational and sometimes it’s just in general, which was the case with me. I realized I could change it by identifying and dealing with the causes rather than just staying stuck in a cycle of trying to temporarily relieve the symptoms. Deep breathing, exercise, and meditation are all wonderful (and highly recommended for multiple reasons), but I’ve found they usually treat the symptoms of anxiety rather than the cause, so for the best results, more action is needed to narrow down the cause.</p>
<p class="indentpara">When I became determined to eliminate anxiety from my life as much as possible, I knew that the first step would be to find some clear way to turn inward and easily identify the core cause of why I was feeling anxious. Although it took me several years of research, perseverance, and personal trial and error, I was finally able to reduce my anxiety by about 97 percent (a smidgen of anxiety can actually be a healthy thing and is totally normal). When I think about it, I’m still completely blown away by the tremendous difference this has made in my life and the happiness it’s created the space for. I now embrace any anxiety that does show up as a message from my soul that I need to examine something. Thinking of it this way is immensely empowering.</p>
<p class="indentpara">I’m going to show you just how to help yourself nail down the cause of anxiety right when you notice it by examining a few specific areas, so you can address what’s going on by taking action. Action is the true, best remedy for relieving anxiety, but first you must be clear on where to direct the effort.</p>
<p class="indentpara">This is mighty stuff, and what I really love about it is that it’s also amazingly uncomplicated. Even if you don’t suffer from anxiety in the severe way I did for so long, this will be super-helpful to you on the occasions it does creep in. Connecting the dots between <span id="page_108">the</span> anxiety and the cause empowers you to go straight to the root of the issue and take action to dissolve it.</p>
<p class="indentpara">So let’s get into how to connect those dots so you can add this awesomeness to your happiness toolbox. The process I’m about to share with you will not only help you greatly reduce anxiety (and stress) but it will also lead to heightened self-awareness about your true needs and desires and help you expand your happiness by eliminating energy drains.</p>
<p class="subhead"><strong>THE THREE PRIMARY CAUSES OF ANXIETY</strong></p>
<p class="justifypara">I’ve found that most anxiety is caused by one (or more) of just three primary factors. For some, there are other factors in the mix such as genetics, past trauma, or certain medical conditions, but for most, these three are the key. And at the risk of ruffling a few feathers, I’d like to share that I was told more than once that my severe anxiety was likely genetic; in spite of that, using these three factors <em>still</em> worked for me! While genetics certainly play a factor in many elements of our makeup, I don’t believe they have to rule over our quality of life; we get to do that.</p>
<p class="indentpara">When I started linking any anxiety (and even some stress) I was experiencing to things in my life that fell under these three categories, an entirely new world opened up for me. When you’re experiencing symptoms of anxiety (sleepless nights, nervous energy, knots in your stomach), check in with yourself to see if you have something going on that falls under one of the causes I share here.</p>
<p class="hanging5"><span class="C527"><strong>1.</strong></span><strong>Neglecting your self-care.</strong> This is like a vitamin deficiency of the spirit. Neglected self-care can deflate us in all areas. It can be as small as badly needing a haircut or having chipped nail polish (seriously!) or as big as putting off a trip to the dermatologist to have a suspicious spot checked. It can mean you know you’ve been eating like crap for days or just that you haven’t been get<span id="page_109">ting</span> enough sleep. When we get busy, it’s easy to let our self-care wheels fall off, but this only leads to chaos. When you feel yourself off track here, immediately make some shifts and change course. It will make a huge difference and help alleviate the anxiety that comes from self-neglect.</p>
<p class="indentpara8">In addition to paying closer attention to neglected self-care, I encourage you to examine your life and look at ways you can step up your self-care across the board. I did this in a big way years ago in my happiness journey, and it’s made a huge difference. I retrained my mind to make taking care of myself a higher priority, adding things like spending time daily outside in nature (even a couple of minutes makes a difference); monthly massages; and small, spontaneous ten-minute workouts several times a week.</p>
<p class="indentpara9">I also began more mindfully guarding where I was exerting my physical and emotional energy (this was a big one). When these and other small shifts became habits, they amplified my level of happiness and helped to decrease anxiety and stress in all areas of my life. And since they were small changes, it was totally doable.</p>
<p class="indentpara9">I can’t emphasize enough how important daily self-care is in increasing and supporting lasting happiness in your life. Caring for your own body, mind, and spirit is your greatest (and grandest) responsibility. It’s about listening to the needs of your soul and then honoring them. It’s about recharging so you can shine your light and be your best for everyone and everything around you.</p>
<p class="indentpara9"><span id="page_110">Be</span> very careful not to allow life to become so busy that you fall into the mind-set that it’s okay to put off taking care of yourself. This is spirit-crushing territory and one of the major cracks in the foundation that can take away from the sustainability of your happiness and peace. If your schedule is too packed to live fully, it’s time for a change. Give yourself permission to do small, loving things for yourself daily, to pamper yourself regularly, and to say no to things that don’t make your heart sing.</p>
<p class="indentpara9">To help stay on track with your self-care during busy times, pause each morning to ask yourself these questions:</p>
<p class="indentpara9"><em>Am I hydrated?</em></p>
<p class="indentpara9"><em>Am I centered?</em></p>
<p class="indentpara9"><em>Do I have needs that are being put off?</em></p>
<p class="indentpara9">Those three questions can help you check in with yourself regularly and quickly determine what might need attention so you can take steps to support your happiness, bust anxiety, and turn up the volume on your peace and joy. Nobody can take care of your beautiful, incredible self like you can!</p>
<p class="hanging5"><span class="C527"><strong>2.</strong></span><strong>Obsessing over things that haven’t even happened yet (and probably won’t at all).</strong> This is a major one, and it’s really about losing track of being in the <em>now.</em> When we stress over what-ifs and fear of what might happen instead of focusing on the present and what actually <em>is</em>, we allow fear of things that don’t even exist yet to rob us of our peace, joy, and even our power to consciously direct a situation to unfold the way we’d like it to.</p>
<p class="indentpara8">A couple of years ago, when I first moved into my new house, I woke up one morning after a rainy night to find a big wet spot on the ceiling in my dining room. I’d just had the electrical system redone, and I knew they did some work on the roof right above that area. I freaked out right away and started future tripping on all the what-ifs . . . <em>What if there are exposed wires up there? What if there’s mold already? What if the ceiling caves in?!</em></p>
<p class="indentpara9">I paced around nervously, and anxiety started to set in. It was <span id="page_111">only</span> 6:30 a.m., so it was too early to call the contractor. I sat down to collect my thoughts and mull over what to do, and something came over me. I burst into laughter right there on my living room couch for the silliness I was creating! None of those things actually existed that I knew of, yet I was allowing my mind—and physical body—to act and feel as if they did, causing me to needlessly stress out and jump on the anxiety train. It was just a spot on the ceiling, and that’s all. Nothing more.</p>
<p class="indentpara9">That morning, I allowed myself a moment to happily take credit for catching what I was doing, because years ago, the old me would have just kept on stressing about all the what-ifs and let it ruin my day or week. Instead, this time, I caught myself and mindfully took control of the situation, squashing anxiety before it took over. I took a few deep breaths, made some coffee, and a little while later called the contractor. He fixed the leak and painted the ceiling at no charge, and all was well again.</p>
<p class="indentpara9">The leak in my roof is a small example, but the idea here applies across all areas. Sometimes, major things such as illness, a financial setback, or other crisis can give you legitimate reason to be concerned. But staying calm and allowing yourself to be mindfully concerned while also staying in the moment and focusing on what <em>actually is</em> right now can help you keep a handle on your clarity and peace, even in the most challenging situations.</p>
<p class="indentpara9">This practice helped me greatly last year when my younger brother went in for a very dangerous surgery to fix a tear in his carotid artery from a skiing accident. I sat in the hospital waiting room focusing on the fact that he was young, strong, and still okay in each moment that went by. I set the intention that all would be okay and that he would soon be recovering, surrounded by family.</p>
<p class="indentpara9">When he came out of surgery and we realized everything went well, I was relieved and felt grateful that I’d remained in a state of peaceful energy and stillness as much as possible. Not just so things were better for me, but also so that I could offer <span id="page_112">the</span> best support for my brother and my family. Hysterics and worry never help a situation, but peaceful energy, staying in the moment, and positive thoughts always do. If we consciously allow it, we get to choose what we bring to the table. This can make a huge difference in how we experience all the ups and downs that occur in our lives.</p>
<p class="hanging5"><span class="C527"><strong>3.</strong></span><strong>Having unfinished business.</strong> Believe it or not, this is possibly one of the biggest anxiety fire-starters there is. All the things we put off add up to drain our energy, cause worry, keep us up at night, and put a damper on our existence. Clutter, difficult conversations yet to be had, paperwork that needs to be done, and things that need to be repaired are all examples.</p>
<p class="indentpara8">As tempting as it is to put these things off, they are peace-suckers that can add up to put a major damper on our joy. Training ourselves to regularly take inventory of the little (and big) stuff that’s looming, and then diligently creating the space to get those things taken care of, is life changing. This is also a great self-care practice.</p>
<p class="indentpara9">I’m fierce about not letting unfinished stuff weigh me down and drain my positive energy. I didn’t used to be, but once I began regularly checking in with my life and zapping lingering stuff before it zapped me, that all changed, and a huge chunk of anxiety disappeared from my world.</p>
<p class="indentpara9">Take a few moments each day to turn inward and examine what you’re tolerating, then create plans of action to reduce, delegate, or eliminate. Make a habit of this, and you will create more light, more peace, and more free time in your life.</p>
<p class="indentpara9"><span id="page_113">The</span> goal is to create shifts and habits that keep unfinished business in your life to a minimum. I’ve worked hard on this one, making some great changes in this area that have made a huge positive difference. I’m still not perfect and that’s okay (I almost always file for an extension on my tax returns), but I’m conscious of it and that has made all the difference. I no longer put off difficult conversations (but I do approach them with love), I take note of little things that need taken care of and then get them done, and I’ve studied and gained awesome time-management skills that have helped me create a healthy balance. Empowering!</p>
<p class="indentpara9">Next time you feel anxiety ruling your day, ask yourself if you have one or more of the following in play: <em>neglecting your self-care, obsessing over things that haven’t happened yet, or having unfinished business</em>. If you use the clarity you gain to empower you to take action and tell anxiety that you’re in control, you’ll notice an astonishing and rapid change. This simple process has changed my life.</p>
<p class="subhead"><strong>SLEEP: IT’S LIKE CANDY, ONLY BETTER</strong></p>
<p class="justifypara">My brother has a pet tortoise called Mrs. T that slips under his house and peacefully hibernates for three months out of the year. I seriously think she’s on to something. Let’s face it: A bad night’s sleep sucks and negatively affects your whole day. If you’re in the habit of regularly starting your days with a sleep deficit, this is a major bliss-blocker in your life.</p>
<p class="indentpara">We all get a crappy night’s sleep from time to time, and some of us (including me on occasion) have suffered from bouts of insomnia, <span id="page_114">which</span> can be maddening. Improving your quality of sleep can bring drastic improvements in every area. Sleep is when our body renews itself. It’s when we heal, and it’s when our minds clear. We simply can’t live our very best lives without enough of it.</p>
<p class="indentpara">I used to have such bad insomnia (fueled by anxiety) that I would often go through a day on just an hour or two of sleep. Most other days, I was only getting five to seven hours, which, over time, is just not enough. When I dedicated myself to researching and practicing radical happiness a few years back, part of that was looking at what can improve my sleep. I was so over tossing and turning, and I knew that making some deliberate changes in that area would be hugely supportive all around.</p>
<p class="indentpara">All of us, at one time or another, have trouble sleeping. When it happens, tons of factors could be in play. They could be issues with diet, lack of exercise, anxiety, or all three (triple whammy). The great news is that when you learn and implement supportive habits that positively impact quality of sleep, as well as learn about and avoid what can screw it up, you can create immediate change in this area. In some ways, it’s helpful to think of sleep as a skill—just like happiness.</p>
<p class="indentpara">By applying the anxiety-busting concepts we talked about in the last section, you can start getting better rest right away. And you can do a number of other supportive things that can make a huge difference in the sleep department.</p>
<p class="indentpara5">Here are a few of my favorites.</p>
<p class="hanging4"><span class="C561">•</span><strong>If your mind is racing when you’re trying to get to sleep, make lists of ten random positive things in your mind.</strong> Healthy things you ate that day, things you’re feeling grateful for that day, little things you’re looking forward to the next day, etc. This will occupy your mind and calm you. When I do this, I often fall asleep before I get to ten. If you get to ten and you’re still awake, start on another list.</p>
<p class="hanging4"><span class="C561"><span id="page_115">•</span></span><strong>Avoid eating for a minimum of two hours before going to bed.</strong> If you can make it three or longer, even better. Changing the kinds of foods you eat for dinner can help as well. Stick with a light, veggie-heavy dinner. In the next chapter, we’ll be covering all kinds of juicy shifts and ideas about food that will help you here as well.</p>
<p class="hanging4"><span class="C561">•</span><strong>Quit the TV and other electronic devices at least thirty minutes before you crash out.</strong> I know this is a tough one, but it will give your eyes a chance to wind down from all that light, movement, and random information. Spend that last time of the day reading, meditating, making lists, or doing small tasks around the house (I personally like to wipe down my kitchen and get the coffeemaker ready for the next morning). If checking social media before bed is too tempting, be sure to have your device on the lowest brightness setting and try to keep the time you spend on it to a minimum.</p>
<p class="hanging4"><span class="C561">•</span><strong>Take a few minutes to read something positive before turning off the light.</strong> Pick a chapter from an uplifting book or a positive magazine. This will put your mind in a peaceful place to drift off.</p>
<p class="hanging4"><span class="C561">•</span><strong>Evaluate the bed you sleep in.</strong> Is it old and saggy? Are you madly in love with your sheets and blankets? You should be! Are you waking up with a stiff neck because your pillow is too flat? Your bed should be a sacred, heavenly place. My life changed when I discovered the combination of a high-quality mattress and organic cotton jersey sheets—it’s like sleeping on a squishy T-shirt! Run, don’t walk, to the nearest bed and bath store and see what speaks to you. You spend about a third of your entire life in bed—it’s worth investing in.</p>
<p class="hanging4"><span class="C561">•</span><strong>Make sure your room is completely dark.</strong> The darker the better. Even the tiniest bit of light through windows or from electronics can affect your sleep. I was amazed how much better I started <span id="page_116">sleeping</span> when I installed blackout curtains a few years ago. When I travel, I even go as far as to stick rolled-up towels at the base of hotel room doors to keep the bright light out. It works!</p>
<p class="hanging4"><span class="C561">•</span><strong>Keep electronics in your room to a minimum and as far away from you as you can while you’re sleeping.</strong> Everything is energy, including your sleep patterns. Keep anything that could possibly put a ripple in that energy at a safe distance.</p>
<p class="subhead"><strong>MOVING FORWARD</strong></p>
<p class="justifypara">While I touched on this earlier, I really want to emphasize that so much of our stress, anxiety, and overall uneasiness in life comes from ignoring what our souls are trying to communicate to us beneath the surface. By embracing feelings of anxiety and uneasiness as red flags from your inner voice, you can use them as prompts to take a deeper look at what really needs to be addressed, and what your authentic truth is in that moment. Mornings are an especially good time to turn inward and examine our inner whispers, as our minds tend to be clear and open to receiving. This mindful approach and heightened self-awareness is a tremendous gift we can give ourselves, and it can make a monumental positive difference across the board.</p>
