<p class="chhead2">Happiness in Hard Times: Creating the Light within Darkness</p>
<p class="justifypara"><span class="fontsize">Of all the chapters</span> in this book, this one, for me personally, was the most challenging to write. To reach the depths of service I truly want to offer you, I had to purposefully go back to some of the most difficult times in my life, to remember and feel some of the feelings of being there, so I could fully embrace what some of you may be experiencing right now, or will be when you come back to this chapter in need of support. In this chapter, I’ll share some very personal things with you and some of the most powerful practices and mind-sets that got me through the roughest seas I could ever have imagined.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Sometimes, life doesn’t just throw you lemons, it throws you grenades. Personal struggle, transition, illness, loss of loved ones—these are all unavoidable events that every single one of us will experience at some point on our journey. This fact can’t be ignored (as nice as it is to not think about it). Happy people aren’t exempt from hard times; they’re just armed with the foundation, outlook, and effective tools to help them navigate, survive, and heal successfully, as well as create the best possible outcomes.</p>
<p class="indentpara"><span id="page_66">It</span> always amazes me when friends or family say to me, “What do you mean you’re having a hard week? Aren’t you supposed to be the happiness expert?” It truly cracks me up. I wonder if they think I’m some kind of wind-up joy robot. (Far from it!) But I have learned some of the most supportive ways to deal with the unexpected lemons and grenades that life can throw at us.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Here, I’ll be offering some insight and powerful tools that will be useful to you in everyday challenges, as well as hugely supportive in getting through life’s most catastrophic events and transitions. They have all been immensely helpful to me in my own personal journey. Some I’ve discovered through research, some I’ve learned through great teachers, and some I’ve come to know through my own experience.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Think of this chapter as its own little book within a book. You can read it now, as well as come back to it when you feel you need loving support and guidance.</p>
<p class="indentpara">To me, a book about creating a happy life without a serious conversation about ways to get through very difficult times is like a car without windshield wipers. Everything’s great until it rains, and then what? Part of building a foundation for sustainable happiness involves preparing to weather the most challenging times with as much peace, light, and inner fitness as possible. The way to do this is to gain skills that help us create supportive, go-to responses for emotional pain and tools to help us find the strength to take baby steps toward healing that lift us up, help us process, and empower us through our journey. Part of changing our view about happiness is embracing the idea that there are always encouraging tools and resources to reach for in any life situation if we’re willing to take action.</p>
<p class="subhead"><strong>MY RETURN FROM ROCK BOTTOM</strong></p>
<p class="justifypara">When I went through my long period of illness in 2008, the transformational journey it sent me on not only changed my life into one <span id="page_67">of</span> sustainable happiness, it also aptly prepared me for a monumental dark storm that was headed right for me. Over the next two years following my recovery, two of my dearest childhood friends passed away suddenly—one through suicide, one through addiction—terrible tragedies that left me heartbroken and also prompted me to examine a few realities in my own life. My priorities had changed big time since becoming happier, and they changed even further with the loss of my friends. I didn’t know it at the time, but a foundation had been laid that would get me through the darkest time of my life.</p>
<p class="indentpara">In early 2012, I was faced with the heart-wrenching end of my ten-year marriage. It ran me down like a stampede of elephants, leaving me desperately lost, reeling, and shattered with bone-crushing grief. I’d been through plenty of losses, failures, and broken hearts in my life up until that point, but nothing even closely resembled the devastation that had just enveloped me like a tidal wave.</p>
<p class="indentpara">I realized during that time that, although I’d been through some serious stuff in my life, until then, I’d never really experienced true, soul-twisting grief in all its devastating and transformational wonder. Suddenly, I was facing the rest of my life without the person I’d planned to spend it with.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Many resources and practices got me through my fog of pain during the couple of years that followed. Many of them I’ve covered already in previous chapters, and I’ll share several more of them with you here. One of the biggest sources of help was the deep belief in my soul that all the destruction and explosive heartache had the potential to be the greatest growth opportunity and biggest transformational journey of my life. I had to believe this to keep breathing. Turns out I was right.</p>
<p class="indentpara">I would survive starting over. I would forgive and learn from my mistakes. I would make it through rebuilding, and I would thrive. Sometimes pulling your life together in the best possible way begins with taking it all apart.</p>
<p class="indentpara">While picking up the pieces of my world, I became intensely <span id="page_68">focused</span> on looking for lessons and for grace. They truly are everywhere . . . if you look. Honestly, some days the pain was so great I couldn’t possibly imagine anything good coming out of it. Grief can be deceiving that way. But in early 2014, as I came out of my cloud of hurt and looked at what the concrete foundation of my own cultivated strength, learned happiness skills, and mindful determination to heal had created, I was astonished and immensely proud.</p>
<p class="justifypara1">Somehow, while in that fog, I’d gone on an amazing, messy, rocky adventure of rebuilding, expanding, renewing, and even being a bit reckless. I’d finally landed on my feet wiser, stronger, and with more love and compassion for myself and others than ever before. It wasn’t easy, but it was worth the fight.</p>
<p class="indentpara">In a nutshell, the previous couple of years had consisted of tons of yoga; zillions of tears; daily prayer (which sometimes involved pleading); a ridiculously unrealistic—but passionate—relationship with a super-charismatic, intelligent guy who was twelve years younger; letting go of a home that I once thought was my dream house; downsizing and getting rid of 70 percent of everything I owned; buying a small home on a plot of land in Los Angeles on which I started an urban farm; traveling to Hawaii, the Bahamas, London, Paris, and Bucharest; a relationship with a sweetheart of a guy who was in no place to be in a relationship (neither was I, for that matter—a reminder that <em>we attract what we are</em>); and, finally, taking a summer off from it all to be alone and just breathe. What a hell of a ride!</p>
<p class="indentpara">When all that was behind me, I began to seriously think about <span id="page_69">writing</span> a book again. Prior to the end of my marriage, I’d been putting notes and plans together for a book on happiness and even had one outlined. But wow, everything had changed so much since then, and it was all on an entirely new level now. There was so much more valuable information to share! I scrapped all my old notes and started fresh with more clarity than I’d ever had.</p>
<p class="indentpara">There were times back in the midst of the storm when I felt like maybe I was the last person on the planet who should write a book on happiness. But when I stepped out of the ashes into my new life after everything I’d been through and learned in the past decade, I realized not only that I was exactly the person to write this book but also that I <em>must</em> write it.</p>
<p class="indentpara">I could now clearly see that the happiness foundation I’d built prior to the storm sustained me through even the darkest days. When truly the last thing I wanted to do was get out of bed, my belief that our lives are ultimately shaped by the way we start our mornings would give me the tiny spark I needed to get myself up, get out of my sweatpants, and put one foot in front of the other. I could also see that my learned nature to always seek things that lift me up, even the smallest things, had helped me to move forward and discover some new, incredibly powerful practices for my happiness toolbox.</p>
<p class="subhead"><strong>IMPORTANT ADDITIONS TO YOUR HAPPINESS TOOLBOX</strong></p>
<p class="justifypara">In addition to all the other skills, mind-sets, and tools I share in this book, I want to share some specific ones with you that helped me to get through difficult times. These are skills and ideas to help navigate choppy waters of all kinds and bring on the healing.</p>
<p class="subhead1"><strong>Feel Your Feelings</strong></p>
<p class="justifypara">Do all you can to heal and feel better, but try not to do things too often for the sole purpose of numbing your pain. When my <span id="page_70">marriage</span> ended and I found myself alone for the first time in nearly twelve years, I went for massages and to yoga classes every chance I could get. But I looked at them as healthful opportunities to let emotions flow rather than bury them. If you could have seen all the times tears would fall onto my yoga mat during the downward-facing dog pose, you’d be like, “OMG, you poor thing!” But the truth is, yoga mat tears were some of the most freeing and empowering.</p>
<p class="indentpara">That’s not to say <em>never</em> do anything with the sole purpose of numbing your pain. Sometimes you need a break. Just make wise choices that will ultimately support you rather than destructive ones that will hinder your growth and healing.</p>
<p class="indentpara">I jumped on more planes than I can even remember while going through my divorce, thanks to banked airline miles and a good friend who happens to be a flight attendant. I love to travel and find it hugely healing and educational at the same time. All the travel helped to distract me at times from the pain of my loss but also helped me to process it and see the beautiful possibility of the new life I was stepping into.</p>
<p class="indentpara">While I know not everyone can jump on a bunch of planes, this was a part of my path that helped me to constructively move forward. Different things work for different people; the key is to find things that are doable for you and bring even the tiniest spark of light into your heart in the midst of a storm, and then <em>deliberately</em> bring them into your space as often as possible. It could indeed be a trip somewhere, but it could also be hiking in the mountains, losing yourself in beautiful books, volunteering for a cause you believe in, going to watch movies solo, planting a garden, or spending lots of time with dear friends—whatever speaks to your soul. The experiences you’ll receive through taking radical action will help you feel alive again.</p>
<p class="indentpara">On a solo trip to Hawaii, I can remember swimming out into the ocean and getting whacked with a sudden, aching wave of emotion that comes along with grief. Grief is like that. One minute <span id="page_71">you’re</span> doing okay, and the next, you feel like someone just slugged you in the stomach. (This is totally normal, by the way.)</p>
<p class="indentpara">I stopped and began to tread water, looking back at the beach. I decided to just let the tears flow. Knowing they were blending seamlessly into the sea was a deep comfort. I said to myself out loud, “You’re going to be better than okay, I promise.” After a couple of minutes of treading and sobbing, I felt surprisingly lighter. Better. I swam back to shore with renewed energy, feeling reconnected to purpose and healing (and ready for a mai tai). It was a reminder to never underestimate the power of a good cry. Seriously. It’s part of a happy life.</p>
<p class="subhead1"><strong>Give It 90 Seconds</strong></p>
<p class="justifypara">One of the most fascinating and helpful pieces of information I came across when researching healing tools was from neuroscientist and author Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor, PhD. (I’m a huge fan of her amazing work.) She says when a person has a thought that brings a strong emotional response (such as the moment I experienced while swimming in Hawaii), a ninety-second chemical process happens in the body, after which it flushes out. If the strongest waves of emotion remain after the ninety seconds, it’s because we’ve chosen to allow them to continue. Basically, it’s like hitting a “replay” button. We can consciously choose to move back into the present and allow waves of anger, grief, and other strong emotions to dissolve, and our body will support us by essentially switching gears. Amazing stuff, right?</p>
<p class="indentpara">In her book <em>My Stroke of Insight</em>, Dr. Taylor shares that when you’re hit with thoughts that trigger big waves of emotion, you can choose to feel and breathe through them for around ninety seconds and then consciously choose to return to the present moment, move forward, and allow the natural release to occur within your brain and body. Do this repeatedly when going through difficult times, and it will become one of your rock-solid, go-to emotional fitness tools. It did for me.</p>
<p class="subhead1"><strong><span id="page_72">Try</span> Ho’oponopono</strong></p>
<p class="justifypara">There are many layers to Ho’oponopono, the ancient Hawaiian practice of forgiveness, reconciliation, and problem solving. I consider myself a dedicated student rather than a teacher, but I’d like to introduce you to it and share with you how it has helped me greatly. It’s truly one of the most profound and effective spiritual practices I’ve ever come across for emotional healing and clearing.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Ho’oponopono is incredibly powerful and simple, and it’s a practice that has completely transformed the way I handle any painful conflict in my life. I first learned of it while writing an article on forgiveness a few years back. At first I was like, “Ho-O-WHAT?” But being a person who is passionate about the power of forgiveness and feels deeply connected to the islands of Hawaii and their history, I was immediately intrigued and wanted to learn more.</p>
<p class="indentpara">The art of Ho’oponopono began in ancient Hawaiian culture as a ritual and spiritual practice that would help families work through conflict, especially when a family member was sick, as it was believed that a person’s mistakes were the root of illness (probably not far off in some cases even today, right?). It begins with a prayer, then acknowledging and working through the problem, reflection, repentance, and forgiveness. Today, it has evolved into a widely known and loved way of resolving conflict, practicing forgiveness, taking responsibility, changing the vibrations of a situation, and clearing hearts.</p>
<p class="indentpara">In the 1970s, healer Morrnah Nalamaku Simeona, a Hawaiian <em>kahuna lapa’au</em> (healing priest), adapted Ho’oponopono in a way that it could be practiced solo rather than just with a family or group. Dr. Ihaleakala Hew Len, PhD, a former student of Simeona, continues to teach and expand on Simeona’s modernized principles of Ho’oponopono today, as does author and seminar leader Mabel Katz, whose expert teachings on Ho’oponopono have been a helpful guide for me.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Part of more modern Ho’oponopono involves a powerful and <span id="page_73">simple</span> healing prayer, or mantra. Every time a person, conflict, or situation that you’re struggling with comes into your mind, mentally repeat over and over again, “Thank you,” or “I love you,” or run together the four phrases:</p>
<p class="justifypara1">Repetition of this magical, cleansing mantra of healing words can lift dark clouds within minutes, help to transform and even erase negative memories, and change the vibrations you’re feeling around the whole situation. It’s about taking complete responsibility, forgiveness, love, clearing, and gratitude. Since memories are playing in our minds all the time, it’s helpful to repeat the mantra often. I sometimes do this for a few minutes straight, almost like a meditation, and sometimes, I just say it one time or a few times together throughout the day. You can even say the phrases when you’re feeling good for prevention and to maintain the healing flow. Feel the energies flow through your mind and body and know the energies are being sent directly to the other person.</p>
<p class="indentpara">When you say the words <em>I’m sorry</em> and <em>Please forgive me</em>, you’re taking responsibility for your part in a situation, no matter how small you feel your part may be and no matter who you feel is at fault. Because the truth is, you really don’t know yet what actually caused a situation or what the purpose is meant to be. Saying you’re sorry for any hurt caused by the situation (compassion), taking personal responsibility without guilt, and finding compassion is amazingly freeing and healing. This is also about releasing attachment to your feelings of being wronged, forgiving yourself, telling a new story, knowing you are responsible for your own feelings and views, and clearing space in your heart.</p>
<p class="indentpara">When you say <em>Thank you</em> and <em>I love you</em>, you’re expressing gratitude for the person or people involved, for the lessons you’ve <span id="page_74">learned,</span> for their understanding, and for the opportunity to grow. You’re thanking yourself for being willing to take responsibility for your healing and to find forgiveness and embody love. You’re expressing thanks for the guidance you’re receiving. Then you’re connecting to the energy of unconditional love.</p>
<p class="indentpara">With all this, you’re creating and feeling the vibration of authentic pure love, forgiveness, clarity, and healing within your heart, and you’re surrounding the entire situation with love and light. Through this practice, you will actually feel a shift in your physical body. Your heart will feel lighter and your mind more at peace. It truly is miraculous.</p>
<p class="indentpara">For me personally, the concept I mentioned earlier of letting our emotions flow and honoring them for ninety seconds and the practice of Ho’oponopono went together beautifully during the darkest times. When waves of heartache would flood my body, I would breathe and repeat the mantra, focusing on the present until the distress melted into peace and clarity.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Ho’oponopono has played a huge part not just in my healing, but in many areas of my life. It’s beautifully powerful. Many teachers and students have grown and benefited from its powerful yet easy-to-understand process. If you’d like to go deeper, I’ve listed some resources in <a href="21_SUGGESTED_READING.xhtml#page_245">Suggested Reading</a> section.</p>
<p class="subhead1"><strong>Don’t Minimize or Compare Your Suffering</strong></p>
<p class="justifypara">This is a big one, and it’s a destructive trap that takes conscious effort to avoid. Have you ever heard yourself saying anything that resembles “Well, what I’m going through pales in comparison to what so-and-so is going through” or “There are people much worse off than I am, so I should feel grateful . . .”? This tends to squash our legitimate grief and pain, resulting in guilt and anxiety for feeling the way we do. Who needs more junk to feel when we’re already going through a hard enough time?</p>
<p class="indentpara">The truth is, if you look for them, there will always be people who are going through things to which our hard times seem to pale in comparison. There will always be somebody who seems to <span id="page_75">have</span> it worse. It’s important to remember that you are not them, and they are not you. You can still acknowledge the suffering of others and feel great compassion for them, but stay away from comparisons. They’re hurtful, irrelevant, and can detract from healing. There is something to be said about gaining valuable perspective from what others have been through and how they’ve handled it, but this is different from minimizing our own suffering by comparison.</p>
<p class="indentpara">What you’re going through at any given time in your life is your journey, and your suffering and grief are valid and real. Give yourself permission to feel the way you do, to seek out resources that will help you, and to filter out anything you just don’t have the bandwidth for, which includes taking on and comparing your feelings to the suffering of others.</p>
<p class="subhead1"><strong>Realize Hope Is Overrated</strong></p>
<p class="justifypara">I know hope has a great reputation for being a beautiful thing, and it can be, but the truth is that it can also be damaging. Hoping to change what we can’t control can block healing and so can repeatedly wishing we could go back or wishing things were different.</p>
<p class="indentpara">When I finally consciously let go of any hope that my husband would have a change of heart about wanting to move on, I could direct that emotional effort toward healing and moving on myself. It was a great lesson in surrender and taking back my own power. Hope in the wrong situations can be a form of misdirected energy.</p>
<p class="indentpara">To truly be free of some things, you must be <em>willing</em> to let go of them. Hope can sometimes be one of those things. When you’re ready, draw a line in the sand and make room in your heart to move forward, be free, and let the light in.</p>
<p class="subhead1"><strong>Listen to Others, But Be Selective</strong></p>
<p class="justifypara">People have a hard time figuring out what to say when someone they know has been blindsided by a major life change. Whether it’s divorce, death of a loved one, job loss, illness, or something else big, well-meaning people can sometimes overstep with their advice <span id="page_76">and</span> opinions. Be open to receiving all the love and support they’re offering, but trust your heart, take plenty of time to think about any big decisions that need to be made (especially financial ones), and be selective about what you listen to.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Years ago, when I left my management job in the corporate world and was thinking about starting my own company, many people told me how so many small businesses fail and that I should really consider sticking with a secure job. It was a hard time for me emotionally. I’d left that job because staying there in a negative environment became more painful than the idea of being unemployed. All the advice I received about whether or not to start my own business definitely caused me to hesitate a bit and left me somewhat fearful. Today, I’m so grateful I took the risk and went out on my own. I wouldn’t be doing what I do today if it wasn’t for the fact that all those years ago I was willing to trust and go for it.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Also, know that sometimes when you share everything you’re going through with others, even when they love you and have the best of intentions, they can be judgmental about your feelings and choices because they won’t fully understand your experience unless they’ve been through an extremely similar one. When this happens, recognize it for what it is and don’t let it cause you to question yourself. Just because someone helps you through a situation, it does not give that person the right to judge you about it.</p>
<p class="subhead1"><strong>Throw a Fit</strong></p>
<p class="justifypara">Allow yourself to throw a fit. A real one. A total, complete mess of a stomping, angry, ridiculous fit that would make any two-year-old envious. Tantrums can be freeing, healthy, and healing. Forget trying to be stoic or graceful for a while. Sometimes, the most graceful way to handle something is to be decidedly <em>un</em>graceful. To break down, sob, stumble, scream, be pissed off, and say exactly what’s on your mind. Through honoring your truth, true grace rises, even out of a tantrum.</p>
<p class="justifypara1"><span id="page_77">When</span> my husband and I split, I threw at least a fit a day for weeks, and then several a month for quite a while. It actually felt good. If I’d let things bottle up, I’d have exploded like a volcano. Sometimes, I’d finish a huge tantrum and find myself laughing at how crazy and foolish it seemed, yet feel incredibly powerful at the same time. Some unfortunate pillows took many beatings. I’d finish with a “Hell yeah! I’ve got this and I <em>will</em> get through it!”</p>
<p class="indentpara">When letting emotions flow without restraint, sometimes we can gain valuable insight that we wouldn’t have been clear on when keeping a lid on things. I can remember a few times when I would spontaneously scream something out loud and then think to myself, “I didn’t know I even felt that way, but that makes sense!”</p>
<p class="indentpara">It’s okay to feel angry, to feel compassion for yourself for what you’re going through, and to ask why. If you feel like you need to do these things while stomping your feet, yelling, and beating up a pillow, know that this is perfectly okay and just go for it.</p>
<p class="subhead1"><strong>Put Together a Pro Team</strong></p>
<p class="justifypara">When something monumental happens in your life, you’ll likely need professional help from someone who is paid to offer you the kind of support and resources you need. Only you will truly know what you need, and your friends and family can only help so much. My team was made up of a fantastic doctor, a coach, a nutritionist, a massage therapist, a housekeeper, a financial advisor, and a great marriage and family therapist who specialized in grief. I didn’t necessarily turn to all of them at once, but interchangeably and as needed (and as budget would allow).</p>
<p class="indentpara">One thing I learned from lining up my amazing team of helpful professionals was that I love having them! Even after my life came back together in miraculous ways, I’ve kept them all on speed dial. <span id="page_78">Having</span> professional help, care, and advice where you need it is not a luxury; it’s a vital part of good self-care.</p>
<p class="subhead1"><strong>Expect the Unexpected</strong></p>
<p class="justifypara">When you go through a major loss or transition in your life, it changes everything: The way you see yourself and your life changes profoundly. The way you see the world changes. Opinions about random things like world affairs and politics that were once deep-seated may change. You may even shock yourself. Collateral changes you’d never expect begin to take place. You tolerate less but have more compassion than ever. Your capacity for BS is not what it used to be. You may even feel like you’ve become a completely different person—stronger, wiser, softer, and with a few permanent scars. To me, scars, inside or out, are not bad. I see them as signs of a full life.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Last year, I went through this really weird thing for a couple of weeks where I felt intuitively that something was out of whack in my life. I spent a few days analyzing myself and turning inward for the answer, but nothing came. It felt as if something inside me was constantly tugging at my shirt, trying to get my attention.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Finally one evening, I was wandering around my house thinking, examining furniture, touching objects, and reflecting on memories from a past life. I stopped in my dimly lit hallway to look at the photos on the wall. I’d seen them all hundreds of times before, but in that moment, a black-and-white photo of me holding my baby niece gave me the answer I’d been seeking.</p>
<p class="indentpara">I stood staring at the photo, astounded by the message I’d just received. Although the photo had been taken five years earlier, I remembered the day so clearly. We were at the zoo, and my husband (at the time), a talented photographer, snapped a beautiful candid shot of me holding the little one up to see the meerkat exhibit. It became one of my favorite photos of all time. Now, looking at it, I saw something amazing. <em>I needed to mourn the woman in that photo.</em> That happy, peaceful woman who had no idea what <span id="page_79">was</span> coming at the time. I needed to send her love, tell her she did the best she could . . . and let her go.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Since the end of my marriage, I’d mourned so many things. The deep love we’d shared, my old life, the life we’d planned together. I never expected that when I was through all that, I would also need to mourn the person I used to be. When I realized this, it all made perfect sense. Now that my life was basically back together and I was feeling great, this was the final step in moving forward and fully accepting who I am today. I loved who I was then, but I really love who I am now!</p>
<p class="indentpara">That night, I lit a candle, sat on my couch, and repeated the Ho’oponopono prayer many times. Only this time, I was not picturing my ex. I was picturing the old me. <em>I’m sorry. Please forgive me. Thank you. I love you.</em> When I woke up the next morning, the unsettled feeling that had been with me for weeks had vanished.</p>
<p class="indentpara">When it comes to unexpected changes that take place after a major life event, I can tell you that not all of them are easy, but they’re all necessary gifts for moving forward. Stay open and accepting of what comes your way. Take a step back from each change as it happens to look for the light. It’s there.</p>
<p class="indentpara">One thing that will very likely happen (and if you’ve been through a huge loss or change before, you know exactly what I mean here) is that when you take a dramatically new path, not everyone you love comes with you on your journey. In the way that trees shed leaves and drop fruit when the seasons change, people will disappear from our lives when our own seasons change.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Some people won’t understand your pain or approve of your choices. Some will be thoroughly rude and insensitive. Some won’t understand or approve of the new you. You’ll discover that some of the people in your life liked the old you better. The more-tolerant you. The one who didn’t desire the depth and support from relationships that you look for now.</p>
<p class="indentpara">You may have to make the hard decision to distance yourself <span id="page_80">from</span> some who have become draining or toxic. Send them love, gratitude, and forgiveness. Then wish them peace and let them go to make room for new people who share your vibe and bring fresh new energy to your life.</p>
<p class="indentpara">You’ll find that the people who truly love you will stick by you through even the most unimaginable hardship, no matter how long it takes you to climb out of it (and don’t let anyone tell you to rush or to “get over it already”). Sometimes, they’re even the ones holding the rope as you climb.</p>
<p class="indentpara">The people who are still standing after the storm will become diamonds in your life. Let them fall in love all over again with the reborn, reimagined, amazing new you.</p>
<p class="indentpara">This doesn’t mean that all the relationships that fall away will be gone for good. Some just need a rest and will heal and blossom again when they’re meant to circle back. It’s all just a part of the natural process of growth.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Be open and hold on. Know that some of the paramount, most extraordinary things in life result from the unexpected.</p>
<p class="subhead1"><strong>Notice Supportive Signs</strong></p>
<p class="justifypara">I’ve learned that there are always supportive signs to be received if we’re open to spotting them. Call them grace, serendipity, divine guidance . . . all are appropriate. One of the truly amazing things about life is all the little events that make nothing seem random. Notice them and embrace them in any way that feels good to you.</p>
<p class="indentpara">A few days after my husband moved out, I was at one of the lowest points of my life. I looked like death and felt like it, too. I knew my body needed extra nutrition, and I needed to stay hydrated. Determined to do all I could to stay physically well, I forced myself to get in the car and head to a little vegan café down the road for a green juice. I approached the counter and asked the charmingly earthy server if they had a juice option made with kale, ginger, and lemon. She replied, “Absolutely! It’s called the Learn to Let Go.” My eyes grew wide and I burst out laughing. She probably <span id="page_81">thought</span> I was a crazy person. It was the first time I’d laughed in weeks, and I felt a welcome wave of loving support from the universe flow though me. I ordered two of the magic drinks, and as I headed back to my car I whispered, “Thanks. Got that.”</p>
<p class="subhead1"><strong>Look Back for Good Reason</strong></p>
<p class="justifypara">Although looking back on the past is sometimes unproductive, reflecting on what you’ve been through can bring beautiful clarity and enlightenment at times. It’s perfectly okay, necessary in fact, to stand on top of the greatest mountains you’ve climbed with the wind in your hair and the sun on your face to look down on all you’ve conquered. To say “I did it.” It’s part of spreading your wings and letting everything you’ve learned become part of your DNA. And it’s a crucial, magical part of letting go and moving forward into your next season.</p>
<p class="indentpara">One thing I was clear on after coming out of my own dark times was that without the happiness foundation I’d built, and so many of the ideas and tools I’m sharing in this book, those times would have been much darker.</p>
<p class="indentpara">I also realized that through it all, even on the most difficult days, I never lost the deep sense that underneath all the heaviness bearing down on me was my true nature of happiness; I could see that happiness can be found in the space between our most challenging moments if we’re willing to look (and train our minds to do so). We can allow that nature to support us, guide us, and be the light at the end of even the longest tunnels. This is the true meaning of lasting, sustainable happiness. At the same time, we must also know that our darkest times will never define or defeat our happiness.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Allowing ourselves to be guided through life by love and our true nature of happiness takes mindful practice, and it’s an ongoing effort. But if we step onto this amazing path and don’t deviate, it’s the one path that will always be illuminated, no matter the obstacles that appear.</p>
<p class="indentpara"><span id="page_82">I</span> know I’ll have times down the road when I’ll need to circle back to the conversation here in this chapter and remind myself of all the power we have over the way we navigate the circumstances presented to us. To remember the ninety seconds of breathing, the prayers, the process of honoring the process. And finally, to remember that in the end, the mountains we’ve climbed will create one amazing landscape.</p>
<p class="indentpara">We are so much stronger than we know. We are equipped with everything we need to make it back to solid ground. It won’t happen overnight, but it will happen. An everlasting pilot light of happiness burns within each of us that is our true nature. Fueling that flame, keeping it burning bright, and learning to turn it back up when it gets dim is at the center of the multifaceted skill of happiness.</p>
<p class="indentpara">You’ve got this. Even when it doesn’t feel like it. Even when the heaviness feels unbearable. You are infinitely loved and supported. Know deeply that somehow, some way, you’ve got this, no matter what. Our greatest breakthroughs can emerge after our biggest breakdowns. Love yourself through it. The universe is behind you.</p>
<p class="justifypara1">Now we’re moving on to <a href="12_PART_II_THE_ESSENTIAL_SHIFT__MAK.xhtml#page_83">Part II</a> of this journey together! I’m excited to outline for you exactly where to begin adding even more bricks to your foundation for super-bright, sustainable happiness—by making over your mornings. It all begins with deliberately choosing and creating the kind of days you want to live from the very moment you wake up, thereby deliberately designing your life on a daily basis. This is the idea that created the single most dramatic positive transformation in my life, and I know it can for you, too. Here we go!</p>
