<p class="chhead2">Eleven Habits of the Happiest People</p>
<p class="justifypara"><span class="fontsize">One of the things</span> I’m passionate about when it comes to happiness is studying the habits, outlooks, and traits that glowingly happy people possess and discovering the ones they seem to have in common. This has taught me so much over the years and has helped me tremendously in creating and sustaining my own happiness, as well as in the work I do to help others do the same.</p>
<p class="indentpara">What I love is that some of the most powerful, supportive habits and traits that have really jumped out at me are not what you’d suspect. Yet they’re simple and profound. When you read them, you may be glad to notice you already have some of these habits naturally, and some may pop out as areas you’d like to cultivate while continuing to build your happiness foundation. You may also find that you’ve started to shift to some of these while reading this book (I hope so!).</p>
<p class="indentpara">Don’t feel like you have to be or do all these things at once. I encourage you to really go all out for the habits you feel drawn to or inspired by and then just work to train your mind to incorporate elements of the others into your natural outlook. Developing new habits, retraining your brain, and shifting mind-sets take time and <span id="page_152">dedication</span> before the magical change happens and they become second nature. It’s an ongoing process, and the key is willingness and dedication to doing the work.</p>
<p class="subhead"><strong>ELEVEN HABITS OF THE HAPPIEST PEOPLE</strong></p>
<p class="justifypara">These eleven habits, along with the five key happiness mind-sets outlined in <a href="10_CHAPTER_2__The_Five_Key_Happines.xhtml#page_21">Chapter 2</a>, are core parts of mastering the <em>skill</em> of happiness.</p>
<p class="subhead1"><strong>#1: Be Deliberately Optimistic</strong></p>
<p class="justifypara">Some people are naturally optimistic. Fortunately for me, I’ve always been this way. But just because they’re natural optimists doesn’t mean they always carry a positive attitude. Just like positivity can become a habit, so can negativity. Even naturally optimistic people sometimes have to make an effort to be positive and do it deliberately.</p>
<p class="indentpara">The happiest people know an optimistic outlook is imperative to emotional wellness, quality of life, and even the outcome of some situations. As a result, they put added deliberate effort into being positive and encouraging others to be positive as well. Even if you’re not optimistic by nature, you can change that nature by doing the daily work of mindfully shifting to a positive point of view about what each day may bring and any situations that come up in your life. With practice, you’ll be more aware of your own negative energy and thoughts as they arise and make immediate shifts until the negativity begins to vanish.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Optimism is not just good for our overall health and happiness; scientific studies show it also plays a strong role in how long we live and in our level of success. Researchers at Yale released a study in 2012 revealing that our genetics account for only 25 percent of the factors that affect how long we live—and we have a significant amount of control over the rest. The study noted that people with <span id="page_153">positive</span> attitudes live an average of 7.6 years longer than those with a more negative outlook. In another study that same year from Duke University’s Fuqua School of Business, 80 percent of CEOs in the United States were labeled by researchers as “very optimistic.”</p>
<p class="indentpara">Living with a positive outlook and seeing the best in every situation is something we can <em>choose</em>. It’s also contagious. When you’re optimistic, you will elevate the energy of the people around you, creating a cycle of positivity that lifts everyone up.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Here’s an exercise to try that may be a bit challenging but also very helpful. Try getting real with yourself for a few minutes and write down a few things you tend to be negative about that could use a shift in perspective. We all have those things that can trigger us to be negative, but changing the way we view and react to them can make a big difference. For example, I used to be pretty negative about doing my taxes. I’d avoid the task as long as I could because I felt overwhelmed by the amount of paperwork involved and feared writing the check at the end of it. I realized I was making it much more difficult than it needed to be with my negativity, so I focused on changing my perspective. I now see doing my taxes as a sort of annual review of my financial health and look at it as an opportunity to see where improvement and growth can take place. I now actually look forward to the process of getting them done.</p>
<p class="subhead1"><strong>#2: Prioritize Mindfully</strong></p>
<p class="justifypara">Happy people have trained themselves to align their choices, intentions, and actions with the highest priorities of love, happiness, and health. They put joy, love, health, and passion first; the rest follows. They dismiss what’s unimportant, and they largely ignore trivial minutiae. They keep an inner flow of mind-sets and priorities that positively support them (while saying no to what’s out of alignment). Happy people focus on what is wholly aligned with the life they truly desire and freely let the rest fall away without guilt.</p>
<p class="indentpara"><span id="page_154">This</span> includes regularly examining and spotting even small joy drains they might be tolerating in their lives, and quickly making edits. With awareness, you can train your mind to do this, and you’ll notice yourself not caring or being bothered by the little stuff that used to annoy the hell out of you, because your thoughts and energy are way too valuable to be spent on those things any longer. Your attention is incredibly valuable; give it only to what deserves it, and let the rest float away.</p>
<p class="indentpara">I used to allow things like long lines, rude drivers, insensitive posts on social media, and bad service to put a serious wrinkle in my day. Now I barely notice them, and when I do, I dismiss them without much thought and go back to focusing on things that are beneficial to me and to the world. We’re in charge of what we focus on and what we respond to, which is incredibly powerful when it comes to happiness.</p>
<p class="indentpara">I do admit: The ridiculous traffic where I live in Los Angeles still frustrates me sometimes, but when I’m stuck in it, I work to make the best of it by listening to an audiobook or calling an old friend. As soon as I make that shift, I stop minding it. We can’t control everything, but we can choose and control our thoughts and reactions and prioritize accordingly, which is life changing.</p>
<p class="indentpara">With mindful prioritizing, you’ll also be empowered to make better decisions on a daily basis by starting with intentions and turning them into action—and this applies to both the little stuff and the big stuff. This is the path to becoming much more focused on what supports your happiness and well-being rather than being caught up in a cycle of making choices based on other people’s agendas.</p>
<p class="indentpara">I didn’t used to be this way. I basically went through three decades of my life with pretty scattered priorities. I was a total people-pleaser, and my decisions and actions regularly reflected what others wanted or needed, or what they thought I should be doing rather than what was best for me. Of course, I knew I wanted <span id="page_155">to</span> be happy, healthy, and loving, but I rarely made strong enough connections in my mind between those desires and most of the choices I was making. This resulted in some regrettable decisions, much unhappiness, and a few unfortunate mistakes.</p>
<p class="indentpara">There’s a great meme going around on the Internet that says, “I chose the road less traveled. Now, where the hell am I?” That was completely me back in the day. I was so concerned about helping everyone else with the path they were on that I was rarely connected with my own path. I hardly ever set intentions before taking action, which took so much power away from what I was doing. I still love to take random dirt roads in life quite often, but I do my best to always know exactly where I am, and I always make sure the path I’m on is mine.</p>
<p class="justifypara1">Your top priorities in life should be your health and happiness and making sure everything you do and every choice you make comes from a place of love. If you do this, everything else falls into place. Life becomes much easier and more peaceful. Every thought or action you have should somehow, in some way, circle back to one of those three fundamental priorities.</p>
<p class="subhead1"><strong>#3: Keep Resources on Hand to Create an Instant Uplift</strong></p>
<p class="justifypara">Happy people are highly aware of the specific things that lift them up, and they naturally and frequently use them when they need a physical and/or emotional boost. Everyone’s different, but we all have those little spirit-lifters that instantly make us feel lighter, <span id="page_156">happier,</span> and more energized. These resources cost very little or nothing at all and don’t take a ton of effort, but they provide noticeable results. It’s all about creating the habit of reaching for them much more often.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Becoming abundantly conscious of a few of those little go-to things that lift you up and bring you joy, and deliberately incorporating them into your days, can elevate your happiness level across the board. It does take effort to create this habit, because it’s so easy to ignore the little stuff that brings us joy when we get busy or feel crappy. But this is when we need them most.</p>
<p class="indentpara">I encourage you to create your own list of a few easy things that never fail to give you an instant mood or energy lift. Then begin to work them into your life as little happiness habits. Create a regular cycle of small, happy items and experiences that can be a standard part of your daily routine (not just occasionally), as well as be there for you when you need an extra boost.</p>
<p class="indentpara">To help you get started, I thought I’d share a few from my own list. This is little stuff, for the most part, but when I became aware a few years ago of how important the little stuff really is to our overall happiness, I started making a conscious effort to include them in my life very regularly. Now anytime I need it (or for no reason at all), I’ll go to the checklist in my mind, pick something, and take action.</p>
<p class="indentpara">A few random things from my list: green smoothies, mani-pedis, solo dance party to at least one Flo Rida, Beyoncé, or Rolling Stones song (I can’t lie—sometimes this involves being naked just out of the shower), planting or pruning plants in my garden, standing out in the sunshine and breathing in fresh air, fresh flowers, a huge glass of cold water with lemon, a yoga class, texting happy images or words of appreciation to dear friends, a hot bath, poetry, reading great posts on my favorite blogs.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Ready? Grab a pen and create your own list. You can also use a separate piece of paper or your journal. Try to memorize the list if <span id="page_157">you</span> can, then make these things into mini-priorities. See if you can come up with at least ten, and if you can think of more, even better.</p>
<p class="indentpara">The word <em>selfish</em> is unfairly vilified. The truth is, sometimes being a bit selfish is actually the best thing we can do for the people we care about. The happiest people frequently tune in to their own needs—without hesitation—and make their own happiness a top priority, which then helps them bring their absolute A game to the people and projects in their lives.</p>
<p class="justifypara1"><span id="page_158">Some</span> of today’s greatest entrepreneurs are fantastic examples of how putting our own needs and passions first can actually help us be better, do better, and be of much higher service to the world. <em>They know that happiness fuels success rather than the other way around.</em></p>
<p class="indentpara">Richard Branson (once again) is a perfect illustration. He’s vocal about making happiness a priority and incorporates his passions into his everyday work life. He has mindfully designed an amazing life for himself that supports him in being the best he can be. He’s so in tune with the idea of self-care as a vital part of productivity that his companies offer employees perks such as flexible hours, opportunities to work from home, fitness programs, and fresh fruits and salads on-site free of charge. He encourages his employees to make their needs a top priority—and it benefits everyone!</p>
<p class="indentpara">Fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg is another great example. (And her beautiful designs are on my list of little things that lift me up.) She finds joy and passion in her work; makes business decisions based on what her inner voice tells her; views self-care as a priority; and incorporates elements of self-confidence, empowerment, and service to the world in both her brand and her life—all of which have contributed to her success and to the happiness she radiates.</p>
<p class="indentpara">I’ve attended many business lectures for executives and entrepreneurs where I’ve heard time and again how important it is to spend as much time as possible on revenue-generating activities. To that I say, the happiest, most successful people know self-care actually <em>is</em> a revenue-generating activity.</p>
<p class="indentpara">If you were taking radical, incredible care of yourself more of the time (i.e., putting yourself first), how would the way you show up in the world change? Think about how your life, certain relationships, and parts of your work might improve dramatically.</p>
<p class="indentpara">When taking care of yourself first, you’re also taking care of everyone else who matters in the process, and knowing this will <span id="page_159">make</span> it so much easier to focus on. Radical, loving, enthusiastic care of your body, mind, and spirit should always be number one. It’s the way to be your most incredible self on every level.</p>
<p class="subhead1"><strong>#5: Be a Prolific Seeker</strong></p>
<p class="justifypara">In the same way a bee buzzes around seeking pollen from flowers, the happiest people resourcefully seek beauty, joy, adventure, pleasure, growth, and powerful meaning in all areas of life. They’re constantly in search of opportunities to marvel, even at the smallest things, and they view life as a classroom packed with lessons and chances to flourish emotionally and spiritually. They drink it all in. This is a quality that can be cultivated and practiced until it becomes second nature, and it’s a major part of overall happiness.</p>
<p class="indentpara">There’s a little bit of this quality in all of us. But the goal is to let it become a dominant part of who we are and what motivates us. In fact, the seeker in all of us, if not fed on a regular basis, can begin to starve and drive us into emotional crisis. All souls have a great need to be fed with beauty, love, and enlightenment.</p>
<p class="indentpara5">To nourish and grow the seeker within you, try these simple exercises that will help awaken your inner seeker and train your mind to always look for light and wonder.</p>
<p class="hanging4"><span class="C561">•</span>In the room you’re in now, take a few minutes to look around at the everyday objects surrounding you. Examine each one through the lens of curiosity, amazement, and gratitude. Think about the people involved in bringing those simple objects to the world—the designers, the sales teams, the entrepreneurs. When you think about just how many people put their hearts and expertise into a simple candleholder, ceiling fan, or chair, these little things suddenly become miracles. Begin to look at everything in the world this way, from the smallest objects to the tallest buildings. This way of looking at objects around you will make beautiful things like visual art, music, and nature seem even more magical and amazing.</p>
<p class="hanging4"><span class="C561"><span id="page_160">•</span></span>Always look for meaning and ways to grow. Lessons are everywhere if we choose to see them. From dreams we have at night to challenging situations we face, there are messages throughout. Seek them out and let them fill your heart with wisdom and appreciation.</p>
<p class="hanging4"><span class="C561">•</span>Seek adventure in absolutely everything. Truly. Even a trip to the porta-potty at the fair can be an adventure (well, that one is probably guaranteed). Looking at every day and every experience as an adventure adds an enchanting thrill to life that can’t be explained. Adopt childlike senses of curiosity and wonder. Viewing life as a perpetual adventure can organically fill your heart with awe and infinite gratitude. Not just for the great times, but even for the failures and rotten days. Now, that’s awesome energy to vibe with!</p>
<p class="indentpara">Finally, prolific seekers also find so much more synchronicity in life, because they’re on the lookout for it. Let yourself reflect on some of the most amazing coincidences of your life and just marvel at them. They really are mind-blowing! Then think about some of the smaller ones. Even some that may have happened today. Keep an eye out. Connections and links between different things in your life can be beautiful, joy-inducing guides if you let them.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Be a prolific seeker. Approach each day on constant watch for love, fun, wonder, beauty, and magic. All that’s amazing is already yours—if you’re looking through the right lens.</p>
<p class="subhead1"><strong>#6: Don’t Make Things Personal</strong></p>
<p class="justifypara">Here’s a fact that can be hard to accept, but when we do, it’s life changing. Ready? Absolutely nothing others say or do is about you. Ever.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Isn’t that a huge relief when you really think about it? Here’s the thing. It’s their stuff. When others talk about you, do things you feel are against you, or try to wrap you up in unnecessary drama, it has nothing to do with you and everything to do with their own <span id="page_161">interests</span> and junk. By resisting the temptation to make things about us, we increase our own happiness and peace while at the same time finding more compassion and understanding for the plights and motives of others. The happiest people have the habit of going straight to this inner knowing that it’s not about them anytime a relevant situation comes up.</p>
<p class="justifypara1">Even when people offer us constructive suggestions on how we can do something differently, it’s still not about us. Rather it’s about their genuine desire to be of help and share their own knowledge.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Unfortunately, we do live in a world where some people feel the need to tear down others in order to feel bigger, and because they feel calling attention to the perceived faults of others helps to camouflage their own darkness. Scrolling through social media feeds can demonstrate this clearly. Some are also willing to criticize or throw others under the bus to avoid awkward situations or to evade taking responsibility for mistakes. Some just commit innocent missteps by misdirecting their own pain, self-doubt, or frustration at others.</p>
<p class="indentpara">It’s all ego driven, and when we can <em>know in our hearts that none of it is about us</em>, we can save ourselves a huge amount of angst. With this view, we can rise above the petty stuff, let much of it go, and, when needed, respond with positivity and love rather than from a place of emotional injury.</p>
<p class="indentpara">This is not to say that you should keep people who treat you poorly in your life. Quite the opposite. Forgive them, understand that this is about them and not you, send them love, and then set the appropriate boundaries.</p>
<p class="indentpara">In addition to not taking personally anything that happens in our lives as a result of others, we need to create the habit of not <span id="page_162">making</span> things personal about other people. As human beings, we can sometimes fall into the traps of gossip, criticism, comparing ourselves to others, and judgment. By becoming aware of our own tendencies to take part in these low-quality activities, we can redirect that energy to much more productive places. I still catch myself falling into some of these traps now and then, and when I do, I’m able to switch perspective quickly. It’s so much better to spend that energy on creating growth and positive vibes, right?</p>
<p class="indentpara">When you take a step back and look deeply at situations where you’ve been hurt or offended, you’ll see that it wasn’t really about you. Empower yourself to release hurt and resentment caused by things in the past that were never about you and to easily see new situations for what they truly are.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Speak, act, receive, and perceive from a place of love and compassion, and many of the things that used to seem negative or personal will transform into opportunities for progress, forgiveness, and illumination.</p>
<p class="subhead1"><strong>#7: Examine the Worst That Can Happen</strong></p>
<p class="justifypara">Yes, at first this sounds negative, but here’s a thought: We tend to think that the “worst that can happen” in many situations is much worse than it actually is. This can cause us to make decisions based on fear instead of reality. In many situations, if we really take a moment to ask ourselves, “What’s the worst that can happen here?” the honest answer we receive will be much different from the scenario we were tempted to base decisions on.</p>
<p class="justifypara1">The happiest people know how powerful a careful examination of consequences can be. This can offer an entirely new perspective <span id="page_163">that</span> can change many outcomes and greatly assist us in making more empowering decisions.</p>
<p class="indentpara">One of the areas where I find this practice very helpful is with obligations that have become unproductive or draining. If I ask myself, “What’s the worst that will happen if I gracefully bow out?” the answer usually helps me realize that releasing myself from the obligation is nowhere near as big of a deal as my fear of disappointing people was making it out to be. It takes a ton of pressure off of you.</p>
<p class="indentpara">This can also be very empowering in building the courage to go after our dreams. By taking the time to really examine the reality of the “worst that can happen” if we take that chance, we discover that the outcome isn’t nearly bad as our fear is tricking us into believing it is. And this can create space for incredible new doors to fly open. When we know we can absolutely handle the “worst,” if by small chance it does become the result, we realize we have much less to lose than we thought we did.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Many of the limitations we’re placing on ourselves aren’t real—they’re illusions. And the habit of taking the time to examine “the worst that can happen” when making decisions or going after our dreams can bring us to an incredible place of fearlessness, peace, and personal power.</p>
<p class="subhead1"><strong>#8: Practice Loving-Kindness</strong></p>
<p class="justifypara">It sounds simple, but consistently practicing loving-kindness is not as easy as it sounds. Of course, we make an effort to be kind and loving toward others, but the pressures and distractions of daily life can sometimes take energy from that focus. Consistently acting from an illuminated kindness mind-set takes deliberate, conscious effort but, when done consistently, becomes a habit that changes the vibration of our lives and the lives of those around us. Plus it just feels great.</p>
<p class="indentpara">The happiest, most successful people are in the habit of allowing kindness to be one of the driving forces behind much of what they do in the world. After all, few things amp up happiness like the feeling of doing something kind for another being, human or animal.</p>
<p class="indentpara"><span id="page_164">A</span> while back, I found an injured songbird in my garden. I was pretty sure it had flown into a window. When it didn’t fly away after a few minutes, I was faced with the question of what to do. I was in the middle of a pretty busy workday, and although it was far from convenient, helping the bird automatically became the priority. I scooped it up into a box and Googled local wildlife rescue centers. The closest one was a forty-five-minute drive. Ugh. Off I went.</p>
<p class="justifypara1">As I was driving away after dropping the bird off at the rescue, I was suddenly overcome with emotion. No accomplishment I could have made that day would have meant as much to my heart as helping that little bird. I imagined what the world would be like if that kind of energy prevailed everywhere.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Incorporating higher levels of loving-kindness in our lives not only makes us happier, it can also help us live longer. In 2013, a study at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill concluded that increased loving-kindness in our lives actually has a positive effect on our biology, including our nervous system and heart health.</p>
<p class="indentpara">We can train our minds to look out for opportunities to spread kindness. They can be as small as spreading smiles and genuine compliments to people you meet or as significant as volunteering at a local charity. The more we spot and jump on these opportunities, the more we will infuse our world with the energy of loving-kindness.</p>
<p class="indentpara">You can also increase your kindness energy with a loving-kindness meditation. This is becoming an increasingly popular form of meditation, for both its simplicity and its positive impact.</p>
<p class="indentpara"><span id="page_165">To</span> try a very simple loving-kindness meditation, sit in a quiet place and close your eyes. Breathe deeply and envision yourself and all other beings experiencing infinite happiness, health, love, and peace. Allow the feeling of sending and receiving the loving-kindness energy to flow all around and within you. Do this for at least three minutes and as long as twenty minutes. You’ll be amazed by how you’ll feel and where this will put your mind. It’s a great little practice to incorporate into your mornings, when you feel stressed, or before you go to bed.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Focus on expanding the energy of loving-kindness in your life, and you’ll expand the way you <em>experience</em> your life in beautiful ways.</p>
<p class="subhead1"><strong>#9: Be Aware of Your Energy</strong></p>
<p class="justifypara">Someone with a lot of time on their hands could probably find amusement in counting the number of times I use the word <em>energy</em> in this book. There’s a great reason for this. Energy is everything.</p>
<p class="indentpara">For much of my life, I was habitually unaware of just how much the energy of those around me, and the energy I was personally carrying, was affecting my life and my happiness.</p>
<p class="indentpara">If I could tell you just one thing that I believe would absolutely bring you more happiness, it would be to <em>create the habit of being highly aware of the energy you’re carrying and emitting into the world around you</em>. Also, be careful of what kind of energy you allow others to bring into your space (steer clear of negative or heavy energy as much as possible). This also goes for energy created by television, social media, and your surroundings. Tune in frequently, evaluate, and examine the quality of the energy within and around you, noticing what needs to be adjusted or abandoned, then shift accordingly. A great way to begin creating this habit is to regularly ask yourself, “How is my energy right now?” or “Is the energy within and around me the best it can be right now?”</p>
<p class="indentpara">We are very intuitive and energetically sensitive beings. The vibes in our space can affect our joy and energy the same way a dimmer on a light switch can change the brightness of a bulb. You <span id="page_166">get</span> to decide on the quality of the energy you create and allow into your life, which is huge.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Realizing how drastically energy impacts our lives is tremendously powerful, and when we really get it, we can use it to our advantage. We can filter out what’s weighing us down and let more light in. We can share more of our own light with the world and be the dynamic, joyful, full-of-life person we’re meant to be.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Upgrade your energy and change your life. Don’t you love the simplicity in that?</p>
<p class="subhead1"><strong>#10: Let Life Move You</strong></p>
<p class="justifypara">French author and philosopher Albert Camus once said, “Live to the point of tears.” The happiest people stay so open to the beauty of life, they receive rushes of awe and complete wonder on a regular basis on multiple levels. They’re always finding adventure and opportunities to marvel. They truly absorb and deliberately contemplate the everyday miracles in everything—and yes, more frequently allow majestic beauty and experiences to move them to tears.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Tears can be wonderful. We typically associate them with sorrow, but there are also tears of joy, compassion, relief, and gratitude. When was the last time you can remember shedding tears other than tears of sorrow? Opening up and allowing the kinds of emotions to emanate from within that can inspire the levels of positive emotions that move us to tears is a skill worth practicing.</p>
<p class="indentpara">It was only about two years ago that I shed tears of gratitude for the first time. I was leaving a meeting with some wonderful longtime clients who are true blessings in my life. I was feeling especially open to receiving good things on that day, and their kindness and support toward me always touches me. I got on the freeway to head home and out of nowhere started to cry. For a moment, it confused me because, although I was feeling happy, these were not simply tears of joy. In my mind I asked <em>Where is</em> this <em>coming from?</em> Then the answer came. Gratitude. I felt an overwhelming sense of gratitude for all the friendship, support, and collaboration these <span id="page_167">amazing</span> people bring to my life. Since that day, I’ve allowed gratitude to move me to tears several times. It tends to do that when you really immerse yourself in it.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Give yourself permission to <em>experience all things more deeply and fully</em>, to allow passion to live in everything you feel, and to be perpetually amazed and moved by life. It’s a beautiful way of being.</p>
<p class="subhead1"><strong>#11: Be Aware of the Media You’re Consuming</strong></p>
<p class="justifypara">A couple of years ago, I noticed a significant drop in my overall positive energy, and it wasn’t hard to figure out where it was coming from. My world was way too saturated with media. E-mail, social media, hundreds of TV channels, the Internet, voicemails, junk snail mail, text messages, instant messages, and more. It all was driving my brain and spirit into information overload, not to mention squashing my productivity and draining my inner peace.</p>
<p class="indentpara">I also felt a sense of loss within my heart. Loss of the calm, open space that lived in my mind before most of this media existed. The space that used to leave room for more wonder, joy, and healthy emptiness was now filled with e-everything. I truly missed that space. I was mourning it. I had to make a shift for my own wellbeing (and sanity).</p>
<p class="indentpara">I began to tune into this issue and found that I wasn’t the only one feeling that way. I took note that some of the happy, successful people I admired were setting major boundaries around the media in their lives.</p>
<p class="indentpara">So I began to create some boundaries around the media in my own life. I spoke to many friends and coaching clients who were all craving change in this area. I realized that in today’s information-packed world, where we’re constantly bombarded with some form of media (much of it negative) from every direction and every device, it’s time for a larger conversation about how this is affecting our happiness, peace, and health.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Social media is here to stay, as is the idea of literally millions of choices of what to watch, listen to, and read. Negativity, violence, <span id="page_168">an</span> exhausting overload of hyped-up news, and offensive click-bait headlines are everywhere, draining our naturally positive energy. It’s all creating a perpetual game of Whack-A-Mole inside our heads. Our minds <em>must</em> have room to wander to stay healthy and vibrant. We’re literally losing our ability to allow our minds to simply wander freely for more than a few seconds at a time.</p>
<p class="indentpara">We must begin to adapt and change our habits in this area. We have to be more vigilant than ever about mindfully choosing media that lifts us up and contributes to our highest quality of life, while at the same time filtering out much of the negative.</p>
<p class="indentpara">The happiest people today are becoming very good at this. They’ve consciously cut back and created filters to manage the media in their lives, and even use it to their advantage by adjusting their e-mails and newsfeeds to contain more positive and less negative.</p>
<p class="indentpara5">To help you start thinking about what might work for you, here are a few things I did (and regularly stay on top of) to create helpful shifts in this area.</p>
<p class="hanging4"><span class="C561">•</span><strong>Take time to get your e-mail systems under control.</strong> As we discussed earlier, unsubscribe from newsletters you don’t ever open and delete old e-mails. Go into your settings to make adjustments such as automatically emptying deleted items daily, filtering certain e-mails into special folders, and optimizing your spam filters. Turn off any sound that alerts you to new e-mail (a major distraction). Then make an effort to check e-mail less frequently.</p>
<p class="hanging4"><span class="C561">•</span><strong>Unclutter your social media the way you’d clean out your closet.</strong> Block, hide, or unfollow people or pages with negative, annoying, or spammy posts. Then add a few pages with positive, uplifting posts that will add actual value to your feeds.</p>
<p class="hanging4"><span class="C561">•</span><strong>Clean up your junk snail mail.</strong> You can do this by calling and unsubscribing to paper catalogs, switching to paperless billing, and even by calling the major credit bureaus to set your credit <span id="page_169">report</span> to private so you won’t get paper spam from credit card companies. You can also speak to your postal carrier about how you can opt out of the junk circulars.</p>
<p class="hanging4"><span class="C561">•</span><strong>Spend some time thinking about other ways you can adjust the media in your life.</strong> Identify what’s draining you and what’s lifting you up and regularly make tweaks.</p>
<p class="hanging4"><span class="C561">•</span><strong>Set your TV to record more shows that lift you up and add to your happiness and growth so they’re there when you want them.</strong> Personally, I love most anything home design, health, or garden related, and I also record a number of spiritual shows.</p>
<p class="hanging4"><span class="C561">•</span><strong>Let go of shows you can live without that are full of negativity or violence.</strong> You won’t miss them, trust me. I stopped watching mindless murder dramas, along with most TV news (with the exception of a few morning news shows, since they tend to be light-hearted and sometimes fun). Don’t get me wrong, I’m a fan of a good scary movie or historical fiction drama now and then, but I watch these very selectively and in small doses.</p>
<p class="hanging4"><span class="C561">•</span><strong>Create space for good things.</strong> The whole idea here is to filter out most of the lower-vibe media that’s not bettering your life, so you can make room for your mind to wander again and so you can create space for media that will actually support your joy and peace rather than take away from it.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Once you’ve made strides filtering and reorganizing all your media, you’ll have room to begin selectively allowing back in some of the good stuff. Set out to create a new habit of reading or listening to something inspiring and positive each day. It can be short—an uplifting blog, a few pages from a book, a funny or enlightening podcast. Whatever you feel drawn to.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Mornings are ideal for this, but before bed works, too. The idea is to set the tone for more positive energy and a better-quality contribution to your life from the media you’re consuming. I now start <span id="page_170">or</span> end my day with at least one positive, spirit-lifting read, and that habit has made a major difference for me. In fact, it was my inspiration for including the <a href="20_YOUR_DAYBOOK_Thirty_Days_of_Insi.xhtml#page_175">monthlong daybook of essays</a>. It’s my way of offering an immediate (and cool!) resource to help you start creating this habit right away without having to think about where to begin.</p>
<p class="subhead"><strong>SMALL SHIFTS, BIG RESULTS</strong></p>
<p class="justifypara">Our habits are truly the foundation of our happiness and of so many other aspects of our lives. Even the smallest negative habits have impact, while tiny positive habits can have big results. I encourage you to take stock of all your habits and begin making some changes that will support your happiness, wellness, and heart’s desires. Know that this isn’t an overnight thing. It can take weeks or even months to dissolve old habits and create new ones. Be kind to yourself on this journey, and be willing to cut yourself a lot of breaks. It’s not about perfection, just positive change. And it won’t always be easy, but it will definitely be worth it.</p>
<p class="indentpara">To make it easier for you to start adopting some new happiness habits and mind-sets, I’ve created a chart (below) with some random examples of switches you can start with. It highlights how simple some of these habits and mind-set shifts can be. You can also take this chart and use its format as a guide to come up with ideas for your own personal goals for habits you’d like to create.</p>

<p class="subhead"><strong>THAT’S A WRAP . . . FOR NOW</strong></p>
<p class="justifypara">As we near the end of this wild happiness ride together, keep in mind that you are one of a kind and so is your journey. I’ve shared some of my stories, struggles, lessons, and solutions, and I’m full of hope that a few have touched you and inspired you to make permanent shifts and additions to the foundation of your happiest life. <em>Operation Happiness</em> is by far the longest love letter I’ve ever written, and I thank you so much for being here and allowing me to <span id="page_172">share</span> with you, grow with you, and create more happiness with you. Before we wrap it up and move on to the daybook I’ve put together for you, I have just a few final thoughts to share with you.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Have you ever put much thought into the metamorphosis of a butterfly? I’ve always been fascinated with it. The caterpillar, after living a pretty dang full life as a caterpillar, sheds its skin for the last time, allowing the new skin underneath to form into a chrysalis, or outer shell. Within the chrysalis, the body of the caterpillar completely transforms, forming new feet, antennae, its own internal GPS, a totally new digestive system, and of course, wings. When it’s ready, the butterfly emerges into the world, ready to begin anew. It’s mind-blowing! It really is a great example of a miracle and an absolutely perfect metaphor for the many transformations we go through in our own lives.</p>
<p class="indentpara">As you move forward into your mission to master the skill of happiness and build your own happiness foundation using the ideas, practices, and habits in this book (and perhaps a few you’ll discover on your own along the way), be totally open and willing to be the caterpillar. Let go of the old stuff, release attachments to anything that’s hindering your health and joy, and allow yourself to form new, fresh ideas about what happiness actually is. Be willing to start from a fresh, completely innovative place—to shed your old skin and learn new ways of living. When you do this, you’ll grow beautiful wings that will take you wherever you want to go.</p>
<p class="indentpara">In all my research and all the work I’ve done within myself to finally become a happy person, the biggest thing I’ve come to realize, next to happiness being an actual <em>skill</em>, is that this is all a <em>way of living</em> that we choose over and over again, every moment of every day. And knowing that we’re a permanent work in progress when it comes to living our happiest lives takes some of the pressure off. It’s a mindful and deliberate effort, and we must practice <em>constantly</em>.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Life loves you—truly loves you. Life itself won’t ever try to rob you of your joy and peace, but some people and circumstances will. <span id="page_173">Know</span> they are powerless without your permission. Embrace and focus consciously on your greatness, your loving energy, and your light. When you do this, those things that aren’t supporting your highest-quality life will fall away with ease.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Embody love, kindness, compassion, and forgiveness. Become them. Remember that anything can happen . . . <em>anything.</em> You are a sparkling light in this universe, connected to all things, deserving of all the love, freedom, peace, and happiness you can imagine. Create it. Be it. Do it. Live it. It’s all within your reach, and it’s all free. Some amazing, radical, happy adventures are waiting for you as you begin your own Operation Happiness.</p>
