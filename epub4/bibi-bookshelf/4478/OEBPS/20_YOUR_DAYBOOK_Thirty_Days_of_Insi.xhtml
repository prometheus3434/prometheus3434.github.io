<p class="chhead2">Thirty Days of Insight, Love, and Lessons for a Happy Life</p>
<p class="justifypara"><span class="fontsize">Since I began writing</span> articles and blogging several years ago, I’ve been asked a number of times if I am planning to take them all and put them into a book. I liked the idea of writing a book, but I wanted it to be more than just a collection of essays. So when I began writing <em>Operation Happiness</em>, it hit me that offering a collection of my favorite essays as a part of the book would be the perfect way to do this—and it would be just the right way to provide great support in creating the new habit of reading something positive every day.</p>
<p class="indentpara1">I’ve carefully chosen thirty of my favorite essays, articles, and posts from the past few years and included them for you here, to create a month’s worth of daily reading. Many of these are very meaningful to me, and many were also my readers’ most liked and shared posts. They tell stories, share lessons, and discuss some big questions. (A few of them are behind-the-scenes peeks at some of the lessons I’ve shared in this book, unfolding in my life as they happened.) I hope you enjoy reading them as much as I’ve enjoyed <span id="page_176">writing</span> them. Storytelling is one of my passions, and this is the frosting.</p>

<p class="subhead5">Could Thinking Like a Rattlesnake Help You Make Better Choices?</p>
<p class="justifypara">A while back, I was hiking with my dogs when they both simultaneously dove their faces into a bush on the side of the trail. They were a few yards ahead of me, tails wagging with enthusiasm as they looked to satisfy their curiosity. As I approached, I shouted, “Leave it,” a command that normally gets them to back away instantly, even from super-tempting treats. But they stayed put, sniffing away.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Thinking it was a rabbit or other furry critter that had scurried under the bush, I walked up and pulled both dogs away by their collars. Peeking into the bush to see what was so interesting, I was shocked to see a nervous, coiled rattlesnake staring back at me piercingly. It was seriously annoyed. It rattled as if to make sure I knew it was not happy and wasn’t afraid to strike, but for some reason, it didn’t.</p>
<p class="indentpara">I stood there, listening to its rattle, both stunned and supremely awestruck that it had resisted the urge to bite one of the dogs that had been inches from its face. It was a major close call. It held its gaze for a few moments and then calmly took the opportunity to slip away. It must have been aggravated, scared, and unsure of what might occur. Yet somehow it remained composed and discerning. Had the snake been hastier in those moments, it would have been a very bad day for all involved.</p>
<p class="indentpara"><span id="page_177">I</span> couldn’t stop thinking about it. Why on earth didn’t the snake strike? I called my brother, who happens to be a well-known expert on reptiles. I told him what had happened and that I was mystified by the fact that both dogs, who were in the snake’s face for several long seconds, had escaped unscathed. He explained that a rattlesnake is inclined to hold on to its venom until it is absolutely positive there is no other choice but to use it. This conserves precious energy and resources the snake may need to catch prey. So the rattlesnake remains calm and aware, observing the situation and following its instinct, being exceptionally careful not to allow fear, anger, or assumptions to take over. In this case, no one was hurt, and the snake was able to go find his next meal.</p>
<p class="indentpara">I was fascinated. It makes such perfect sense. I thought, what if we applied this mindful logic when presented with important decisions or facing a conflict? What if we could by instinct remain calm and rational, hold off on making a move until we truly understand all sides of a situation, and then take the time to move forward with the best possible solution? Could thinking like a rattlesnake help us more carefully consider consequences and make better choices that are in line with our best interest?</p>
<p class="justifypara1">A great example of where this would apply is when we’re tempted to lash out and say or do something we don’t mean (and will regret soon after). When this happens, we miss out on creating love, progress, and solutions through peaceful and more productive means. Words and actions brought on by misunderstandings, judgment, and anger are venomous to our lives and <span id="page_178">our</span> relationships. It all leads to emotional pain and damage that could be avoided with a more objective, thoughtful approach to challenging situations.</p>
<p class="indentpara">The place to begin creating a shift is in truly knowing and being honest with yourself. Learn to recognize, understand, and acknowledge the emotional triggers that make you feel angry, pressured, or fearful when faced with a challenge or decision. Once you’re raw and honest with yourself about these triggers, you can teach yourself to stay calm, objective, and peaceful as you move forward.</p>
<p class="indentpara">I know I’ll be keeping this approach in mind when considering new projects. I remember a time when I would jump on almost any interesting project that came my way without examining whether it was right for me or would add too much to my plate. Taking the time to assess each new situation and make an educated, conscious decision will honor my time and creative energy.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Where can you be more like the rattlesnake? Small shifts based on this idea can create positive change and make a great difference for you and the people in your life. It’s about being true to yourself, keeping your cool, and owning your power. It’s about pausing mindfully before moving forward with purpose. And in the end, it’s about making love-based choices that use your energy wisely and empower you.</p>
<p class="subhead4"><em>Day 2</em></p>
<p class="subhead5">Take That Risk—Sometimes the Grass IS Greener Over There</p>
<p class="justifypara">Taking risks, as frightening as some may seem, is a necessary part of a full, happy life. This is what Helen Keller was referring to when she said “Life is either a daring adventure or nothing at all.”</p>
<p class="indentpara"><span id="page_179">Since</span> this idea is a key truth in living our best life, why are so many of us afraid to take the risks that our hearts are nudging us to take? The answer could lie in the need to rethink all the limiting beliefs that resulted from many of our childhood experiences.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Growing up, we heard all kinds of clichéd sayings and “stay small” ideas that eventually conditioned us to create these limiting beliefs, as well as develop the tendency to quiet our own voices. Many of us were taught not to take risks and, in many ways, not speak our minds.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Remember those old ones, “No swimming after eating” and “Children should be seen and not heard”? Total nonsense, right? What about the notions of how dare we think we’re awesome? How dare we think we’re amazingly talented at something? How dare we “show off” or “brag” about it!</p>
<p class="indentpara">I remember when I was a school-age child, I was so afraid of other kids (and even adults) calling me “stuck up,” “show-off,” or worse for simply believing I was good at something or wanting to show what I was capable of, that after a while I started to actually believe I wasn’t good at those things—I had no right to “show off.” So I purposely stayed quiet and careful not to love myself too much or believe I was really good at something.</p>
<p class="indentpara">This mind-set stayed with me into adulthood, until I finally realized through self-reflection and spiritual teachings what total and complete malarkey those limiting beliefs and fears are! I wasn’t doing anyone any good (especially myself) by holding back, staying small, and crouching within my comfort zone.</p>
<p class="indentpara">I worked hard to let go of those old beliefs, shift my thoughts, and create big, positive changes. Our purpose is to be happy, to shine, and to share our gifts with the world with love and enthusiasm.</p>
<p class="indentpara">To shine as bright as we’re meant to shine, and to live our dreams, we need to be willing to venture outside of our safe <span id="page_180">space</span> and take risks. We need to release fears about what others will think or say and let go of the fear of change, because holding back doesn’t serve us or the world.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Another old “stay small” saying we commonly hear is <em>“</em>Well, you might want to rethink that one, because the grass always looks greener on the other side!” Translation: Don’t take that risk, because the idea that things might get better if you make a change is an illusion.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Now, I am a big believer that the grass we’re standing on gets greener when we water it. Sometimes giving more of ourselves in a given situation, or <em>watering our own grass</em>, can make all the difference. However, the truth is that sometimes the grass is actually greener on the other side, and sometimes it’s time to break free, spread our wings, and go after a change.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Twelve years ago, I made a daring decision to leave a corporate movie studio job that was draining my light and negatively affecting my health. That job was a safe place to be, technically, since the pay was pretty good and the benefits were, too. But the environment there was turbulent, I was always walking on eggshells, and my creativity and talents were basically being kept in a dusty box on a shelf. I had nothing else lined up, no savings to speak of, and I was emotionally bankrupt. But I simply took the leap and trusted the universe that I would land in a much better place.</p>
<p class="indentpara">After a couple of months of healing and rest, I felt called to start my own business and have never looked back! Today, I work from my home studio on my beautiful little city farm, doing work that brings me great joy and allows me to be of <span id="page_181">service</span> to others. Without ignoring those who were telling me to play it safe by staying in that unhappy situation, and without following what my inner voice was telling me—that the grass just might be greener somewhere else—I wouldn’t be living the empowered, happy life I am today. I’m so grateful!</p>
<p class="indentpara">We’ve been conditioned to feel we’re wrong or misguided when we dare to think the grass is greener <em>over there</em>, but the truth is, sometimes it IS! If your heart is nagging you to make a change, go for it! Listen to your inner voice. Follow what that whisper is telling you.</p>
<p class="indentpara">There are no mistakes in taking risks. There are only opportunities for growth and learning. In fact, we stay stuck and hold ourselves back from our most powerful, meaningful lives by not being willing to sail out of the safe harbor and pursue the change we desire, come what may.</p>
<p class="indentpara">So, if your inner voice has been telling you it’s time for a change, to pursue that dream, to leave that relationship, to move on from that energy-draining job, to move to that new beautiful place . . . do it! You have the power within yourself to move forward to new, greener pastures. Take the risk! Share your gifts with the world. Be happy. Sometimes the grass is greener in that other place. Our hearts always tell us when it is. The magic is created when we make the daring journey.</p>
<p class="subhead4"><em>Day 3</em></p>
<p class="subhead5">It’s Not the Thing You Want—It’s the Feeling!</p>
<p class="justifypara">A couple of years ago, I went on a huge, amazing journey to downsize my life. I sold my large house and about 70 percent of everything I owned. I bought a small house on roughly a quarter of an acre and started a little urban farm. I can’t tell you how healing, inspiring, and fulfilling it’s been.</p>
<p class="indentpara"><span id="page_182">Along</span> my path to simplicity and minimalism (still working on these, but have made huge progress), I learned a profound, empowering lesson that applies to so many areas.</p>
<p class="indentpara">When it comes to that thing we desire, whether it’s a piece of clothing, shoes, or a new job . . . most times, at the end of the day, it’s not the <em>thing</em> we’re truly after but the <em>feeling</em> we will have when we get it.</p>
<p class="indentpara11">It’s all about how we want to <em>feel</em> not necessarily what we want to have. (Not that a new job, sweater, car, or pair of shoes isn’t awesome now and then.) It’s just that many times we find ourselves unfulfilled when we finally get that <em>thing</em>, so we buy more things or go after another job, or relationship, or whatever we’re drawn to. This can leave us buried under way too much stuff or unsatisfied with a job or relationship we already have because we think we need a new one to be able to feel the way we want to feel.</p>
<p class="indentpara">The key here to authentic joy and lasting fulfillment is to go after the feelings rather than the things. To learn to create them from within. To look for ways to manifest those feelings of joy and satisfaction with what we already have, both from within ourselves and with our current situations or material possessions.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Begin by focusing on the awesomeness of what is and allowing feelings of tremendous gratitude to flow, even for the small stuff. Make it a regular practice to look around at all that’s in your life and say to yourself, “This is freakin’ incredible!” Allow yourself to really <em>feel it.</em></p>
<p class="indentpara"><span id="page_183">When</span> you begin to focus on the <em>feelings</em>, two magical things will happen. First, you’ll feel a more sustainable state of joy because you’re living from a place of gratitude, recognizing the incredible abundance and gifts already present. Everything from material stuff to relationships will become more satisfying and amazing to you. (Yes, please!)</p>
<p class="indentpara">Second, your consciousness will have an automatic filter that will allow you to be more aware when you’re making decisions about purchases or major changes. You can ask yourself, “Is it the thing I really want, or am I just looking for the feelings I think may come with it?” If the answer is the feelings, you can look inward for ways to create those feelings without making the major purchase or change. You may even realize you didn’t really want that thing in the first place.</p>
<p class="indentpara">This approach will not only help you have fewer possessions and keep you from making life changes based on temporary circumstances but it will also make the things you do purchase and the shifts you do choose to make that much more meaningful and mindful. You’ll end up with possessions and circumstances that you’re totally in love with. And you won’t have a bunch of stuff cluttering your life that just isn’t that important to you. How awesome is that?</p>
<p class="indentpara">Focusing on the feeling you’re looking for is also great motivation. For example, if you’re working on a big project you really want to complete, but you’re feeling a little uninspired and overwhelmed by the steps it will take to finish it, try closing your eyes and allowing yourself to feel the feelings of having completed it. Picture the goal accomplished and feel the fireworks of satisfaction going off in your heart. Talk about inspiration to get moving!</p>
<p class="indentpara">This year, I plan to incorporate these practices into my efforts to continue this joyful, simple, amazing life I’m living. I’m grateful for all of it.</p>
<p class="indentpara"><span id="page_184">Take</span> a look around you right now and see the magic and light that is already in your life. <em>Can you feel it?</em></p>
<p class="subhead4"><em>Day 4</em></p>
<p class="subhead5">What If You Don’t Have to Let Go Completely?</p>
<p class="justifypara">Recently, I found myself in the middle of a kitchen remodel. You can probably relate to the craziness that goes on when you have no kitchen for three weeks. Last week, I had the chance to learn how to use a tile saw. Yep—both scary and awesome at the same time!</p>
<p class="indentpara">I was cutting tiles for the kitchen floor and having a rough time about halfway through because my hands really started to ache and the tiles were chipping on some of the cuts, which was so fantastically frustrating.</p>
<p class="indentpara">About to give up, I tried one more tile, but this time, I decided to see what would happen if I didn’t hold on to it so hard when guiding it through the saw.</p>
<p class="indentpara">It was perfect.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Not only did my hands immediately stop hurting, the saw moved through the tile with ease as I guided it and made an absolutely flawless cut. I was so excited! I rocked it! It’s the little things, right?</p>
<p class="indentpara">Only this wasn’t so little. I finished cutting the tile, and a voice popped into my head and said, “What would happen if you lightened up your grip in some other areas of your life?”</p>
<p class="indentpara">Whoa! It then occurred to me that holding on to some things too tightly had been a pattern in my life for a long time. Struggling to hold on to things that may not want me to keep holding on so tight. Gripping too tightly to things that weren’t meant to be exactly the way I wanted them to be. Being too attached to <span id="page_185">things</span> that just needed a little time and space to manifest into what I was looking to create.</p>
<p class="indentpara">It got me thinking about the idea of letting go—about how letting go is actually often the best way to hold on. But sometimes, that’s easier said than done in the moment, especially if we just don’t feel ready or if we don’t quite have all the answers.</p>
<p class="indentpara11">Maybe we don’t always have to completely let go of what we’re not quite ready to let go of. Maybe, in some situations, we’re not meant to let go completely—only just enough to allow space for things to fall together. Sometimes, we can first try just loosening our grip . . . and waiting to see what happens.</p>
<p class="indentpara">This could be an amazing way to get unstuck. To change the dynamic of a painful situation, or even to attract something you’ve been going after but unable to quite make happen. It can allow space to gain insight and see more clearly. It could also be a powerful stepping-stone toward truly letting go, if that’s what’s meant to be.</p>
<p class="indentpara">What comes to my mind in a big way is a past relationship. I did everything I could, in the most loving way I could muster at the time, to save it from ending. But the more I held on and tightened my grip, the farther out the ship sailed and the more things fell apart. Holding on so tightly only made things worse and didn’t offer the chance or space for things to come around naturally. Looking back, the most powerful, healing, and loving way to fight for what I believed in would have been to lighten my grip. To let go a little. Just like with the tile saw.</p>
<p class="indentpara">So what could change if you lightened your grip? Didn’t hold <span id="page_186">on</span> so feverishly? Created the space for a particular situation to naturally blossom or change, and allowed things to happen in their own time? Empowered yourself to move forward whether or not you’re totally “over it” yet?</p>
<p class="indentpara">It just might be the beautiful, amazing middle ground you’ve been looking for.</p>
<p class="subhead4"><em>Day 5</em></p>
<p class="subhead5">How a Journey to Have Less Helped Heal My Heart</p>
<p class="justifypara">In the spring of 2013, I made a huge decision to drastically downsize my life. My ten-year marriage had come to a heart-wrenching end months before, and that January, having just made it through my first holiday season in eleven years without my husband, I found myself living alone in a very large house, surrounded by silence and a decade’s worth of accumulated possessions. I didn’t know where I was going from there, and, at times, it felt like I didn’t have the energy to care. My heart was broken, and for the first time in my life, I had no plan.</p>
<p class="indentpara11">I remember standing in the middle of the living room feeling overwhelmed by all the responsibility I was facing in the wake of what I’d been through. Sometimes, putting your life back together actually begins with taking everything apart.</p>
<p class="indentpara">In that moment there in the living room, I suddenly felt very clear about what I needed to do next. I wanted to downsize—not <span id="page_187">just</span> a little, but drastically. I wanted to sell the big stucco house with no yard and find a small home with a garden. I wanted to travel. To simplify. To live freely.</p>
<p class="indentpara">I then realized the beautiful future that could be waiting for me was currently buried under a ton of stuff. So I went on a crusade to sell, donate, or give away as much as I could. My goal was to lose 70 percent of it. It was a big challenge, but it felt completely empowering. Once I began my mission, the doors that started to fly open for me blew me away. The house sold in forty-eight hours for more than the asking price. The perfect home for me appeared—a tiny house surrounded by trees on nearly a quarter-acre alongside the Los Angeles River, and my offer was accepted over eighteen others. Help was coming to me from every direction in unexpected forms. I knew in my heart that the universe had my back, and I felt supported.</p>
<p class="indentpara">With every step in my downsizing journey, my heart was healing, and at the same time opening again. The steps I’d been taking to lighten my load and take charge of my life, along with the healing work I’d been doing internally, opened me to the possibility of a new relationship, new ways of living, new friendships, and other new opportunities from a place of wholeness instead of lack, which made all the difference.</p>
<p class="indentpara">After escrow closed on my old home, I said a teary goodbye that was both emotional and cathartic and put the remainder of my possessions into storage (all but a single suitcase). I had thirty days until I could move into my new home. What to do!? I’d taken the month off work, had no stuff and no place to be. I was a free bird, and it felt pretty amazing.</p>
<p class="indentpara">I went to stay on a foldout couch at the home of some of my best friends. We all lived in community for a month, sharing stories and meals by the pool, laughing, crying, dreaming, and making plans. I could feel and see the color and light coming back into my world. And you know what? I didn’t miss the stuff. <span id="page_188">Not</span> one single thing, not for one moment. I didn’t even think about it, and it was truly eye-opening. I had a truckload of possessions hidden away in storage, and for weeks, I’d forgotten any of it even existed.</p>
<p class="indentpara">When I moved into my new home, I was very selective about what I brought with me. Half of what had been in storage didn’t make the cut. I spent time writing and working in the garden and decided to turn the property into a small, sustainable urban farm. I added vegetable beds and a chicken coop and brought the neglected fruit trees back to life. As the land flourished, my spirit did, too.</p>
<p class="indentpara">It seemed that what I needed kept appearing at just the right time. I finally felt ready to begin putting energy back into serving through my writing, speaking, and coaching again, and I was amazed by how my experiences had empowered me to be stronger in every area.</p>
<p class="indentpara">The lessons that came from that time will fuel me for as long as I’m around. I thought moving on from my old life and into a new one would be one of the hardest things I would ever have to do, and it was. But what I wasn’t expecting was that it would also be one of the most enlightening journeys I’ve ever made. I learned that simplicity, love, authentic forgiveness, vulnerability, and minimalism are the keys to creating a truly free life filled with light. I learned that getting really clear about what you want often starts with getting really clear about what you don’t want.</p>
<p class="indentpara">This morning, in the middle of writing this article, my eleven-year-old German shepherd, Venus, escaped the yard after the gardener accidentally left the gate open. After several minutes of frantic searching, I found her a few blocks away sniffing around, happily trotting and wagging her tail, making new friends. Relieved, I bent down and put my arms around her. I looked her in the eyes, and I could see a spark of bubbling joy. I realized that in those few minutes of wild abandon, she proba<span id="page_189">bly</span> felt much the way I did during those healing days of freedom by the pool with my beloved tribe.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Instead of being angry with Venus for going out on her little adventure, I scratched her on the head with an understanding touch, and she followed me home. I was grateful to her for reminding me that few things in life are more valuable than living freely and being <em>willing</em> to allow ourselves to heal and grow by stepping out of what we’ve always known to explore uncharted waters.</p>
<p class="subhead4"><em>Day 6</em></p>
<p class="subhead5">Go Ahead and Feel Free to Wander</p>
<p class="justifypara">In case you’ve been wondering, it’s okay to be a wanderer. It’s okay to not know what you want to be when you grow up—no matter what your age. It’s okay to deliberately create totally new chapters of your life anytime you feel inspired to explore, to marvel, to desire.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Love everything and everyone; make your art; plant your seeds. Live with amazement, passion, and a sense of wonder. Shake things up. Let go of the tendency to compare yourself to others, and definitely let go of attachment to other people’s opinions.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Free yourself from the idea of what you thought your life would be or should be, and be enlivened and spellbound by what is and what can be. You are a radiant, gifted being of light. Embrace the now and be ready and open for what might be next. Go after that dream your heart’s been longing for. Wander. Seek adventure. Remember, anything can happen!</p>
<p class="subhead4"><em><span id="page_190">Day</span> 7</em></p>
<p class="subhead5">How to Destress and Embrace Abundance</p>
<p class="justifypara">Ever catch yourself completely stressed out about something and then have a lightbulb moment and laugh at yourself when you realize how unnecessary (or even silly) the stressful tripping is? Well, I’ve been in the middle of a kitchen remodel. Not a big fan of the dust and chaos, but so excited for my inspiring new space to create beautiful, healthy food!</p>
<p class="indentpara">I recently had a major wake-up moment and a good laugh at myself when I recognized a specific trap I fell into and saw how easy it was to instantly change my entire outlook and experience with one powerful but simple realization. Love those shifts!</p>
<p class="indentpara">I’d been feeling a bit stressed out about the whole kitchen thing. Other than the expected chaos of sink deliveries, pending construction, and appliance shopping, I was feeling a little crazed about going over budget and all the extra expenses that had been piling up (you know how the old saying about home stuff goes . . . everything takes twice as long and costs twice as much as you plan). I was driving home from shopping for faucets when it hit me: <em>I’d fallen into the lack trap!</em></p>
<p class="indentpara">What’s the lack trap? Basically, it’s allowing yourself to fall into a mind-set of lack or “not enough” in any given situation, whether it’s financially or on another level. When I realized I was viewing the entire project from a place of lack instead of a place of abundance and light, I realized that was exactly why I seemed to be attracting more lack! Ding! I completely cracked myself up with how silly it was, and I immediately felt less stressed and more peaceful about the entire project. Peaceful about a kitchen remodel? Yes, it’s possible!</p>
<p class="indentpara">What we focus on expands, and the energy we put out attracts the same energy in return. I wasn’t doing myself any service by <span id="page_191">focusing</span> on the mounting expenses and falling into the mind-set of not enough. Yes, it’s absolutely important to be mindful about spending and creating a realistic budget, but it’s also important to have the confidence that even if unexpected things pop up (and they usually do), there’s always a way to work it out.</p>
<p class="indentpara11">The universe is looking out for you, and when you shift your focus and mind-set to abundance and expansion, you support the universe in sending more goodness your way. So that’s my big tip to share with you; approach all you do with a mind-set of abundance and having enough. Allow yourself the inner knowing that even when challenges come your way, there is always a way to work things out (even if it’s not the exact way you might first envision). This is a great way to keep stress to a minimum and make things happen.</p>
<p class="justifypara5">Here are two more of my favorite ways to reduce stress and more fully enjoy all that is.</p>
<p class="hanging7"><span class="C527">1.</span>No matter what you have on your plate, make your self-care a top priority. It’s easy to neglect your own needs when things get busy, but we must take care of ourselves in order to show up in our full awesomeness for those who are important to us. Schedule time for the gym, a massage, a bath, or even a few minutes each morning for a quiet cup of tea. This will support you in joyfully gliding through all you have on your calendar.</p>
<p class="hanging7"><span class="C527">2.</span>Speaking of calendars, I am very guarded with my calendar. It’s easy to let our schedule get too full to live fully, and this is a major energy- and joy-sucker. If I don’t schedule myself <span id="page_192">regular</span> quiet evenings at home, free time to be creative, and time to just chill out, I see the results showing up everywhere. Also, I am careful about what I say yes to. If it’s not “Hell yes!” it’s “Hell no!” Funny how this strategy works: You soon will find your calendar 98 percent full of hell yeses, which is an awesome way to live!</p>
<p class="subhead4"><em>Day 8</em></p>
<p class="subhead5">When Your Heart Says “Hell No!”—How to Step Out of a Bad Situation</p>
<p class="justifypara">So I had a random little experience while visiting Paris (I’m in love with that city) earlier this month that was empowering, a little brave, super-fun, and thought provoking—all at the same time.</p>
<p class="indentpara">My friend and I had booked an afternoon tour to visit Monet’s gardens at Giverny, which I was looking forward to, being a passionate gardener. On the day of the tour, it poured rain. I’m talking buckets.</p>
<p class="indentpara">We showed up since the booking confirmation said rain or shine. The bus was an hour late to pick up our group, and the city was gridlocked with traffic jams. We were feeling uneasy about the circumstances but boarded the bus anyway.</p>
<p class="indentpara">A few minutes into the ride, rain pounding so hard we couldn’t see out the windows, the driver announced that it would take at least ninety minutes to get to our destination, at which point we might only have half an hour before they closed. I looked around the bus, which was inching along in traffic, and saw people looking pretty miserable. I tapped my friend on the shoulder and whispered, “Do you want to get off? Do you want me to ask the driver to stop the bus?” It was an easy decision.</p>
<p class="indentpara">I got up and politely asked the driver to stop the bus so we could jump off. We had no plan, but anything seemed better <span id="page_193">than</span> spending four hours round trip on a tour bus to spend thirty minutes at a garden in the middle of a storm.</p>
<p class="indentpara">At the next light, the driver opened the doors, and we said, “Au revoir,” jumping off the bus in the rain, laughing and feeling thrilled with our decision. How to spend a free afternoon . . . in Paris . . . in the rain? Suddenly, the rain seemed like the best thing in the world!</p>
<p class="indentpara">We walked the shops and found a little café, where we ordered a bottle of wine, some amazing food, and spent time people watching and chatting with locals. It was a delicious, joy-filled few hours that turned out to be the result of a good, split-second decision to abandon a plan gone wrong.</p>
<p class="indentpara">This experience got me thinking about how many times in our lives we find ourselves on a bus we probably shouldn’t have gotten on, headed in a direction we don’t feel good about.</p>
<p class="indentpara">We’ve all been in situations where our inner voices were telling us to abandon ship and, for whatever reason, we kept going to our own detriment. We give in to pressure from obligation, pressure from others, or fear of disappointing people, or maybe even because we invested and are hesitant to lose our investment, even if the price of staying on course is more costly.</p>
<p class="indentpara11">We spent more than two hundred dollars on that tour, but we realized quickly that even if we didn’t get our money back, it was worth the loss not to have to waste an afternoon stuck in traffic on a tour bus. We weighed our options and decided the potential loss was okay with us—and it turned out to be the right decision.</p>
<p class="indentpara"><span id="page_194">So</span> here’s what I want to share with you and get you thinking about: If there is any situation in your life—a job, a relationship, an obligation—anything you don’t feel right about and have been unsure how to handle or have been afraid to exit . . . just do it. It doesn’t have to be a graceful exit. It doesn’t have to be perfect, and you may disappoint some people. But it’s not about that. It’s about being true to you.</p>
<p class="indentpara">I can remember times when I stayed unhappy in jobs for way too long, went on trips I didn’t want to go on, and gave my time out of obligation to things that didn’t feed my soul. I can remember many times I went through with things I didn’t want to do because I was afraid of disappointing people.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Now, there is something to be said for keeping a commitment if it’s going to hurt people or cause big problems if you don’t follow through, but 95 percent of the time, that’s not the case. And you want to know what else? People will forgive you, and they’re much more understanding than you think.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Many of these situations can be avoided by being more conscious of and really examining how you feel about a commitment or situation before getting yourself embedded in it. Sometimes, a no is the best solution. But they can’t always be avoided—sometimes, we don’t know things are going to go south until we’re in the thick of them.</p>
<p class="indentpara">So if you’re in one of these situations, how do you begin your plan to get off your metaphorical bus to misery? First, ask yourself, “What’s the worst that can happen?” or “Can they do fine without me, really?” You’ll find that the answers are usually pretty supportive of your desire to exit. Trust me, almost every time, they CAN get by without you, and everything will be fine.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Then make a call, have a conversation, or send an e-mail—whatever you feel is appropriate—and kindly explain from your heart the way you feel, that you need to remove yourself, and that, if needed, you are happy to assist with any transition resulting from your exit. It can be uncomfortable, but the dis<span id="page_195">comfort</span> will be short-lived, and the result just may be an amazing afternoon at a Paris café—or something even better.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Let go of what’s not working. Be brave enough to move on. Make bold choices. It’s okay if they’re last minute, split second, or otherwise—as long as you’re following your inner voice. Be audacious enough to ask the driver to stop the bus so you can jump off and see what adventures are waiting for you.</p>
<p class="subhead4"><em>Day 9</em></p>
<p class="subhead5">Is Loving-Kindness the Ultimate Multivitamin?</p>
<p class="justifypara">A while back, I was sitting in the peaceful waiting area at my gym, waiting for a massage appointment. Another woman sat down to my left just as two ladies entered arm in arm, one helping the other into a chair. When I saw their faces, I knew right away they were mother and daughter. The striking resemblance between mothers and daughters (or fathers and sons), physically and in terms of mannerisms, is one of those beautiful wonders in life. What was special about this pair was that the daughter looked to be in her midseventies.</p>
<p class="indentpara">The woman sitting next to me asked them if they were mother and daughter, and the younger woman answered, “Yes, this is my mom. She just turned ninety-four.”</p>
<p class="indentpara">I smiled, listening to these sweet ladies converse. The ninety-four-year-old mom said energetically, “Are we all relaxed today, ladies?” She was full of light and joy.</p>
<p class="indentpara">The woman next to me said to her, “You look amazing and full of life! What’s your secret?”</p>
<p class="indentpara">Without hesitation, the mom replied, “I’ve always surrounded myself with nice people. That’s the secret.”</p>
<p class="indentpara">I was touched by both the power and the simplicity of her answer. I’ve often thought about, and even written about, how <span id="page_196">allowing</span> unkind, negative people into our lives can affect our emotional and physical well-being. I’m a big believer in being very mindful about what we tolerate. But I hadn’t really thought too much about how it could affect our physical health in the long term, and specifically our longevity, until now.</p>
<p class="indentpara11">Could it be that after conscious healthy eating and regular physical activity, the next most powerful key to a long life is kindness? As kindness is an expression of love, and love is the most powerful force known to us, this connection is undeniable. Psychology affects our biology in powerful ways and therefore our longevity.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Many studies support this idea, including a 2013 study at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill where half the participants were assigned to take part in a loving-kindness meditation each week for six weeks. The other half was assigned to a control group.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Participants in the group taking part in the loving-kindness meditation practice increased in positive emotions in comparison to those in the control group, as well as increased in vagal tone (the activity of the vagus nerve, our longest cranial nerve). In general, the greater the vagal tone, the greater the physical health of the person, especially heart health. The study results suggest that positive emotions of loving-kindness, positive social connections, and physical health influence one another in a self-sustaining, upward-spiral dynamic.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Increased love and kindness in our lives affect our biology in impactful, healthy, and positive ways. This is great news, because it means that we have more tools to increase our physical wellbeing, as well as our chances for longer, fuller, happier lives.</p>
<p class="indentpara"><span id="page_197">We</span> can eat healthfully, exercise daily, and even live a relatively happy life. But if toxic, negative people are around us on a consistent basis, and we’re allowing their negativity to affect us within—like a slow-moving bacterial infection—this alone could bring on disease by weakening our defenses.</p>
<p class="indentpara">On the flip side, even if the negative energy created by others in our lives is at a very low level, I believe our health and longevity can be affected by being closed off to the abundance of love and kindness offered to us from so many sources. The key here is to make a shift to being mindful—consistently remaining in a state of openness and deliberately noticing the beauty in the world, especially during rough times. This can mean something as small as taking a moment to breathe in and be grateful for a smile from a stranger.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Here are some thoughts on how we can make a shift to reduce the negativity we absorb from others and increase the levels of love and kindness we give and receive.</p>
<p class="hanging8"><span class="C534">•</span>The energy we put out comes right back to us. If we begin to take responsibility for it and make a conscious effort to be kinder, gentler, more compassionate, and more loving toward others—on a consistent and meaningful level—the kindness and love that comes back to us to fill our hearts will be greatly magnified and will be a source of light for others. Like attracts like.</p>
<p class="hanging8"><span class="C534">•</span>We must look closely at, and be mindful of, what we tolerate. Everyone has ups and downs, but if there are people in your life who are consistently negative, unkind, or toxic, changes need to be made. Walk away from, or decrease your exposure to, those people who drain you in negative ways. You deserve to be treated with love in every scenario.</p>
<p class="hanging8"><span class="C534">•</span>Change the way you look at some of the negative people you experience. Know that toxic, negative, hurtful behavior is a cry for love and acceptance. By seeing a person who is being <span id="page_198">negative</span> or hurtful with compassion and love, we can change the way we respond to that person. Perhaps we can even create a powerful positive shift that will break a toxic cycle (for ourselves and for that person) through our response of love and kindness. This is a great place to start healing relationships.</p>
<p class="indentpara">The message we can receive here is that we have the power to choose to create simple shifts right now, shifts that will benefit both our physical health and emotional fitness (as well as others’) in amazingly positive ways and increase our chances of becoming centenarians with ease.</p>
<p class="indentpara">I also believe there is an even greater message here to be considered. The answers science has been looking for to increase the human life span don’t necessarily lie with pharmaceuticals, animal studies, or test tubes but may lie in a kinder, more loving, more giving world.</p>
<p class="indentpara">As citizens of this global community, the call to action from this perspective is to collectively work together to shift our energy to love, compassion, and kindness—in purposeful ways on such a level that the duration of our lifetime on this earth can be expanded beyond what we ever thought was possible. Long live loving-kindness.</p>
<p class="subhead4"><em>Day 10</em></p>
<p class="subhead5">How to Be Happy and Grow Through Dark Times</p>
<p class="justifypara">People often ask me, “How are you so dang happy all the time?!” Well, here’s the scoop: I’m not. Well, at least not completely. But I do consider myself a super-happy, fulfilled person overall, which feels awesome and is something I couldn’t honestly say ten years ago. Life feels good! I do have challenging days now and then, and even bumpy weeks and months. I go <span id="page_199">through</span> major storms and general life BS, and all the ups and downs. What I know with certainty is that there is a key to staying happy even when times are hard and when it comes to shifting our whole perspective on creating our happiest life. In fact, it could be the single biggest approach to living our happiest existence.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Being happy is not just about choosing to be happy moment to moment. It’s not just in the great days and fabulous occasions. It’s about knowing down deep that no matter what’s going on, we have the tools, the gratitude, and the love within us to find joy within the dark times, too. To know in our core that the clouds will pass in their own time and that, underneath it all, our happiness is still there to support us, even when we’re not feeling it.</p>
<p class="indentpara">In the history of the sky, there has never been a cloud that didn’t eventually pass, right? And beyond the clouds, the sky is always bright and blue. So being a happy person is about knowing down deep that our happiness is always there inside us—bright and blue, just like the sky on the other side of the clouds. It’s about knowing that no matter what’s happening, it’s okay to still find moments of joy and great value underneath it all. To be grateful for the good that is. For the lessons. To focus on love. This is how to be happy through the clouds. When we get this, really get it, we can reach in anytime we need it and allow the rays to begin shining through. This is not only the key to making it through dark times more easily, it’s also a core path to healing.</p>
<p class="indentpara">The last few years of my life have been by far the most challenging yet. I recovered from a painful, debilitating illness that lasted more than a year, two of my dear lifelong friends passed away suddenly, I lost a mentor who was a true beacon in my life, and my ten-year marriage came to an end. And there was also unpleasant life junk mixed in there to add to the fun (surgeries, moves, you name it).</p>
<p class="indentpara">Yes, there were days I felt like I might just shrivel up like a dried <span id="page_200">leaf</span> and blow away in the wind. On those days, I just allowed myself to <em>feel it</em> (because it’s perfectly okay to allow yourself to have days that suck once in a while without beating yourself up about it). On the worst days, I found light by mindfully sending loving energy to those people and situations that were painful for me.</p>
<p class="indentpara11">With all this, believe it or not, the past five years have also been the space for some of the happiest times in my life. This is because a few years ago, I finally understood that being happy through—and in spite of—the storms is the answer to a truly happy life. This knowing has been at my core through it all. It’s looking for and embracing those moments of joy during even the darkest times that can help us get through. It’s having the strength to reach for the smallest spark of light, even when we feel broken open. This is what pulls us through.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Allowing ourselves to feel, acknowledge, and process sadness, grief, anger, and all those other feelings is an instrumental part of moving forward and living our happiest lives. All those emotions are valid and help us heal and grow. But during these times, we also tend to create an inner struggle to squash joy, because the ego can make us believe that joy shouldn’t exist during those times. The powerful truth is that so much sweet stuff and so many lessons that add to our happiness come to us through these emotions and experiences.</p>
<p class="indentpara">A while back, I cracked open a fortune cookie and the message inside said “The cloud will rain success on you.” Times had been rough, but I knew the clouds were beginning to part and thought to myself, “Yep! I’ll take that!” The fortune stayed on my refrigerator for days until, after seeing it several times, the true message finally hit me. It’s awesome if you think about it. It wasn’t saying <span id="page_201">“</span>When this crap is over, success will come your way” but rather “The cloud over your head right now is going to rain good stuff on you—WHILE you’re under it—so keep your eye out!” Exactly!</p>
<p class="indentpara">The most amazing gifts, lessons, and experiences are sometimes found <em>under</em> the clouds. Our job is to stay open, look for moments of joy, receive, and let it rain.</p>

<p class="subhead5">Five Keys for Attracting Supportive, Positive People</p>
<p class="justifypara">We’re all looking for ways to consistently surround ourselves with a supportive, positive network of people who believe in our dreams and lift us up. Cultivating and nurturing a posse of positive, uplifting, enthusiastic people who have your back is a crucial part of creating your success and joy on all levels.</p>
<p class="justifypara6">But how can we expand our network of people who light us up? How do we simplify meeting, getting to know, and staying in contact with our network? Here are five keys to help you get started creating your own superstar empowerment network and attracting a supportive, positive tribe.</p>
<p class="hanging7"><span class="C527">1.</span><strong>Be what you seek.</strong> BE that person who is supportive and positive toward others, and in turn you will attract supportive, positive people into your corner. The energy you project is the energy you will receive in return, so be sure to bring it when you attend social and business events.</p>
<p class="hanging7"><span class="C527">2.</span><strong>Turn off traditional media.</strong> Begin subscribing to positive news and blog posts that make you feel supported and uplifted. Instead of negative news, try watching TED talks, subscribe to uplifting blogs, listen to positive podcasts. This will shift your internal energy and put you in a better place to attract people into your life who are in line with all you wish to create.</p>
<p class="hanging7"><span class="C527"><span id="page_202">3</span>.</span><strong>Seek out people who are actually DOING.</strong> Look for ways to connect with those who are successfully creating for themselves the energy that you want: career, love, networks of friends, etc. Then don’t be afraid to reach out. A great way to begin is to ask if there is a way you can be of help to them. Being of service to others is always a fabulous place to start.</p>
<p class="hanging7"><span class="C527">4.</span><strong>Do what you LOVE.</strong> Find a way to make what you like to do part of your networking. People will be drawn to you when you are living your passions. Find ways to incorporate things you love to do into your everyday work or projects. And reduce the energy you spend on things you don’t love (I personally don’t love texting, so I try to use it only for quick plan making or to send addresses, phone numbers, etc.). I try instead to communicate by phone, e-mail, or social media.</p>
<p class="hanging9"><span class="C527">5.</span><strong>Carefully choose how you spend your time.</strong> When an invitation doesn’t make your soul leap, consider saying no. Your time is valuable, so the more you spend it cultivating relationships and projects that feed your soul, the more empowered you will be. And remember that just because an opportunity seems a bit uncomfortable doesn’t mean you should turn it down. Sometimes, stepping outside of your comfort zone is exactly what you need to shake things up in super-positive ways. The best way to attract a network of people who will light you up and inspire you is to be that light for others.</p>
<p class="justifypara7">Start with kindness, being of service, and being genuinely interested in the passions of people you connect with. You <span id="page_203">may</span> even discover some new passions of your own, in addition to amazing, soul-feeding friendships.</p>
<p class="subhead4"><em>Day 12</em></p>
<p class="subhead5">Is Your Schedule Too Full to Live Fully? Three Ways to Create More Free Time</p>
<p class="justifypara">I’ve been feeling lately like I need to take a look at my schedule and do some serious unscheduling, which I try to do whenever I hear my inner voice whispering to me to slow down. I’ve become pretty good at managing this over the years (with a lot of practice), as free time and time for myself are like oxygen to me and to my creativity. I didn’t used to be so good at the scheduling stuff, and I still have to be mindful about it or things will creep into my schedule that I have no idea why I said yes to.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Ever look at something coming up on your calendar and think, “How the ‘bleep’ did THAT happen?” Fortunately for me, working to align my schedule with what makes my heart sing has helped me greatly reduce those moments.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Recently, I was doing some gardening in my little backyard farm in L.A., and it occurred to me that nature has this scheduling and load-lightening stuff down to a science! A great example I took note of was that when a fruit tree feels stressed, lacks nutrients, or has too much young fruit growing on it, it drops some of the fruit before it develops. This allows the tree to focus its energy and resources on the fruit that remains and in turn create beautiful, big, juicy works of art! As I looked at all the unripened little citrus fruits lying on the ground around my orange and grapefruit trees, I felt inspired by this simple concept. Sometimes, we just need to release what’s not serving us and drop some fruit!</p>
<p class="justifypara5">Back in the day, I would run myself ragged with jam-packed <span id="page_204">days,</span> excess travel, and too many projects at once. I’d do all this without considering how much of my energy it was taking until I would find myself depleted and unable to focus on what was actually important to me. It wasn’t until several years ago (back in 2008) that I finally hit a wall, physically and emotionally, and knew I had to make some changes. I thought I’d share some of those changes with you here, so you can take what might work for you and apply it to help lighten your schedule and your life.</p>
<p class="hanging7"><span class="C527">1.</span>Make it a positive habit to think mindfully about obligations and projects before saying yes to them. If your soul isn’t telling you “hell yeah!,” then seriously consider a no.</p>
<p class="hanging7"><span class="C527">2.</span>Even if you’re making an effort to allow only things that feed your soul (or things that are absolutely necessary) on your schedule, sometimes your schedule will still become too full. Make a point each week or month to check in with your calendar and ask yourself, “Is my schedule too full to live fully?” If the answer is yes, look for some things to drop or reschedule for a time when your load is lighter.</p>
<p class="hanging9"><span class="C527">3.</span>Schedule unscheduled time. Purposely leave some mornings, afternoons, even entire days blank so you can have some time now and then to just zone out or do something you feel inspired by in those moments. I block out time in my schedule to have absolutely nothing planned, and I always end up thanking myself. Not to mention, some of the best times are the spontaneous ones—when you just go where the wind takes you.</p>
<p class="justifypara7">Think about living more like a fruit tree and learn to tune in to the need to drop some of your fruit so you can recharge <span id="page_205">and</span> focus on what’s important to you. Shift your focus to schedule your life with things that light you up, feed your spirit, and help you feel excited about each and every day. It will take some practice for this to become habit, but if you’re open to this change, it will make a major positive difference in the quality of your life.</p>
<p class="subhead4"><em>Day 13</em></p>
<p class="subhead5">Important Reasons You Need a Vacation Now</p>
<p class="justifypara">The other day I spoke to a friend who told me she hadn’t taken a vacation for over three years, and she felt completely burnt out. When I asked her why she’d gone so long without a break, she said she’d been super-busy and never seemed to be able to fit it in. She also explained that in the office where she works, there’s a sort of silent discouragement when it comes to taking time off. This made me a little sad and really got me thinking how many people are living that same scenario.</p>
<p class="indentpara">I’ve learned through my own experience that when it comes to things like rest, travel, or anything else we long for, if we’re not making the time, we’re making excuses. In our culture here in America, there is a certain pressure overall not to take much time off. A sort of “vacation shaming” exists that is counterproductive on so many levels. We do it to others, to ourselves, and we even do it to the president of the United States every time he picks up a golf club.</p>
<p class="indentpara">We must let go of this old-school idea that taking time off somehow decreases productivity or implies someone is not fully dedicated to his or her work. It’s quite the opposite. Taking ample time to rest our body, mind, and spirit increases productivity, amplifies creativity, and even elevates the quality of our <span id="page_206">work.</span> It’s time to ditch outdated mind-sets and embrace balance and flexibility.</p>
<p class="indentpara">I believe a company filled with a bunch of burned-out, low-energy people who rarely take time off makes less money in the long run than if they were to give each of those employees several weeks a year of vacation time and make it mandatory they take it. Happy people make fantastic employees. Some successful companies with smart leadership know this, and they make ample vacation time, work-at-home days, and other soulful perks available for their staff.</p>
<p class="indentpara">When our soul needs rest, we can feel the call. If we ignore that call for too long, we can burn out, lose our mojo, become physically ill, or even drive ourselves into emotional bankruptcy.</p>
<p class="indentpara">If you haven’t had a vacation since you took a few days off three years ago to attend your cousin’s wedding, you absolutely need a break now. If you haven’t taken more than a week off in over a year because you’ve been “too busy,” your schedule is too full to live fully.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Really, it doesn’t matter how long it’s been. It doesn’t even matter if you went to Hawaii for ten days last month. If you’re feeling like you need a break, you need one, and you’ll be a sharper, more fulfilled, healthier version of yourself for taking it.</p>
<p class="indentpara11">Here’s the thing. You don’t just owe this to yourself. You owe it to those you love. To those you work with. You owe it to the world. Because if you’re rested, happy, and well, you can show up as your most incredible, dynamic, energetic self for everyone and everything in your life.</p>
<p class="indentpara"><span id="page_207">Allow</span> yourself space in your life for vacations and downtime. Take it without apology. Live. Make this a priority and your life will reach new levels of joy, peace, and success. The busyness can wait.</p>

<p class="subhead5">How to Be Responsible for Your Energy and Shine Brighter</p>
<p class="justifypara">Learning to recognize when you need to shift your energy to a higher, brighter vibration is an awesome skill that is worth expanding.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Regularly tune in to ask yourself, “How is my energy right now and is it lifting me up, as well as the people around me?” Then, if needed, take steps toward shifting. You can also ask yourself, “Am I approaching my world and the people in my life with big love right now?”</p>
<p class="indentpara11">Choosing to see the world and everything around us through a loving lens is the key to creating a life filled with high-quality energy, joy, and peace. It also offers us effective, conscious approaches to problem solving—especially in relationships.</p>
<p class="indentpara">I can think back on several times when simple shifts in the energy I was putting out would have changed the course of my life in positive ways and definitely would have spared me from a few crash-and-burn moments. I take full responsibility for those times now, have learned from them, and clearly see how my low <span id="page_208">vibrations</span> negatively affected different situations. Focusing on love is where it’s at.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Over the past couple of years especially, it’s become crystal clear to me that if we can open ourselves to looking in the mirror and seeing when the energy we’re carrying is negative or coming from a place of lack, we take back our power to create quantum change. It can be challenging, but with an open mind, heightened awareness, and practice, these kinds of energy self-checks will come naturally and be hugely beneficial.</p>
<p class="justifypara5">We can do many things to shift our energy. The key is finding what works for you personally and then keeping those things in your toolbox to pull out and apply, when needed. When your energy changes, you can literally feel it in your core. Here are three ideas I’ve found helpful for creating personal energy shifts.</p>
<p class="hanging7"><span class="C527">1.</span>Change gears and do something different. Go for a walk, spend a few minutes with a pet, hit the gym, or turn on some music and have a two-minute dance party. Or simply take some deep breaths and shift focus on something funny or uplifting.</p>
<p class="hanging7"><span class="C527">2.</span>Take a few minutes to sit somewhere in silence and think only about love, compassion, what you’re grateful for, and positive intentions.</p>
<p class="hanging7"><span class="C527">3.</span>Do something healthy for your cells. Pop a multivitamin, drink a green drink, hydrate your body with a big glass of purified water, have an organic veggie salad for lunch. Doing something healthy for your body will lift you up and create an immediate shift in your energy, both on a physical level and a vibrational one.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Create the habit of regularly turning inward for an energy self-check. When we shine bright, everyone and everything around us shines brighter, too.</p>

<p class="subhead5">Time Does Not Heal All Wounds—Here’s What Does!</p>
<p class="justifypara">It’s been beautiful here in L.A., so I’ve had tons of opportunities to work in my garden. It’s one of those things that totally lights me up!</p>
<p class="indentpara">While building a fence over the weekend (yes, me with hammers, nails, wood, and wire!), I had a powerful thought about happiness, grief, and our ability to heal that I wanted to share with you.</p>
<p class="indentpara">I was happily hammering away at a fence post when I felt familiar pangs of pain yanking at my heart. They came on suddenly, as they sometimes do. I felt a little frustrated that a loss that occurred nearly two years ago was still stabbing at me at the most random moments. Can you relate?</p>
<p class="indentpara">Even the happiest, most grounded people aren’t immune to pain from transition, grief, or loss, which everyone will experience at some point. I grew up believing the old saying “Time heals all wounds.” I heard it from my family, from the media, and from my teachers. However, I’ve come to know the real, big truth about that . . . <em>time itself doesn’t heal anything at all—WE DO—it just takes time to do it.</em></p>
<p class="indentpara">Truth is, sometimes it takes quite a while, and we need to push on, even when we don’t want to—cut ourselves a break for the time it’s taking. Continue actively taking steps to heal and move forward. Every single day.</p>
<p class="indentpara11">Healing, just like happiness, does not take place without action. Action is what heals. Effort. Practice. It may not be what we want to hear, but it’s the truth. And it’s where our power to thrive and shine again resides.</p>
<p class="indentpara"><span id="page_210">So</span> what I want to share with you is: if you’re hanging out waiting for time to heal your heart, your spirit, or even your body . . . we all need to remember it’s not time’s responsibility to do that . . . it’s ours, and action is required if progress is going to happen. Time is just a friend to help us along the journey.</p>
<p class="indentpara">We heal our heartache, grief, and regret through action, growth, forgiveness, and gratitude through frequent, deliberate steps to move forward and into the awesomeness and light that is right here in this moment and is always waiting for us around the next corner, if we allow it to be.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Have you ever read the book <em>The Pillars of the Earth</em> by Ken Follett? It’s my favorite novel. It contains a great analogy for this message.</p>
<p class="indentpara">In <em>The Pillars of the Earth</em>, it took the builders of twelfth-century England decades to build the massive, majestic cathedrals. Everyone talks about how long it took. But time did not build the cathedrals; the builders did. Their effort, sweat, creativity, and <em>action</em> . . . and just look at the amazing result. They powered through and made it happen, no matter what life threw at them.</p>
<p class="indentpara">So I invite you to join me in recognizing that <em>we are always the ones with the power.</em> While time is a factor (a broken bone, for example, takes a certain amount of time—but also care—to heal), it’s not the driving force.</p>
<p class="indentpara">What healing actions can you take today to expand your happiness and health? Step forward, break out your best moves, and make room for the amazing things that are waiting. Here we go!</p>

<p class="subhead5">Are You Living with Hidden Negative Energy?</p>
<p class="justifypara8">Recently, on a long flight home over the holidays, I discovered something that really got me thinking. Sometimes, very small, even unnoticed, things we allow in our lives are covertly draining our energy and adding negative vibes to our existence.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Squished into a tiny window seat on the plane and making the best of it, I had decided to go through and delete numbers and addresses from my phone that I knew weren’t good anymore. People that had moved, changed phone numbers, or whatever. I was sure there were at least a handful of them in there.</p>
<p class="indentpara">What I found surprised and even startled me a bit. There were tons of contacts that had no purpose taking up space in my phone, or my life, any longer. Some of them were ten years old. People I’d worked with on a single project a decade ago, a few toxic people I’d distanced myself from years prior, duplicate entries (can you say clutter?), and, I’m embarrassed to admit it, but even a few people I’d put in by first name and had no idea who they were.</p>
<p class="indentpara">What really struck me is that some of the names even packed a little sting when I looked at them. I’ve let go of many difficult things from the past, so why was I allowing some of them to <span id="page_212">come</span> calling again via reminders in my address book? I wondered why I’d let all these entries I no longer needed exist in my phone for so long. Part of me wanted to kick myself (<em>step off, inner mean girl!</em>), but instead I decided to see it as a lesson.</p>
<p class="indentpara">As minor as it seems, all those unneeded contacts had been like tiny little flashes of negative energy every time I had to scroll through the names in my phone. I wondered where else I was allowing overlooked clutter or negative reminders to detract from my positive energy. I went on a mission to seek and eliminate.</p>
<p class="indentpara">There was more. Much more. In previously ignored piles of papers in my desk drawers (old tax bills and expired coupons), in a filing cabinet in my garage (court documents no longer needed), and even in my jewelry box (lonely single earrings that had been missing the matches for at least a year and were sad to look at). The keyboard for my Mac was screaming to be cleaned. Typing away on a dirty keyboard was definitely not helping my creativity.</p>
<p class="indentpara">I also realized some of the things that had been radiating energy-sucking vibes in my life were actually things I hadn’t wanted to let go of before: piles of photos from long-past relationships and old x-rays and medical records from surgeries that happened years ago.</p>
<p class="indentpara">I realized having these things around wasn’t serving me in any positive way. On top of that, simply by existing in my personal space, they were quietly draining tiny bits of my positive energy the way a nail slowly drains the air from a tire. It may not happen right away, but eventually the tire goes flat. Or blows.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Since this major lightbulb moment, I’ve been on a little mission. Each time I come across something that no longer serves me or doesn’t in some way add positive energy, I immediately chuck, donate, clean, or shred it. It’s an entirely new and deeper <span id="page_213">level</span> of clutter busting. I’ve made it part of my self-care practice, and it’s been surprisingly empowering.</p>
<p class="indentpara"><em>Where in your life are you tolerating hidden negative energy? Look closely.</em> What you discover might amaze you and leave you scratching your head.</p>
<p class="indentpara">A great athlete looks to eliminate any minuscule thing that drains energy or might hinder performance. We should do the same for ourselves in our everyday lives. Why continue settling for less? Seek, identify, eliminate, and then watch the light in your life shine even brighter.</p>
<p class="subhead4"><em>Day 17</em></p>
<p class="subhead5">Three Important Truths about Happiness</p>
<p class="justifypara">If you ask ten different people how to achieve happiness, it’s very likely you will receive ten different answers. Everyone has different views and thoughts about what makes them happy, and in some ways, it’s definitely a uniquely personal journey. However, some universal keys and skills for living a truly happy life can make all the difference.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Personally, I believe happiness should be a subject they teach in school, starting at an early age. It is, after all, one of our most important life skills, if not the most important. Proven methods and techniques for being fundamentally happy can be learned and practiced just like playing the piano. But unfortunately, unlike piano lessons, we don’t commonly engage in happiness lessons.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Growing up, we’re misled to believe that happiness comes to us through success, material things, relationships, achievements, and other external sources. While these can be wonderful and can contribute to a happy life, they’re only building blocks and are not part of the concrete foundation of happiness.</p>
<p class="indentpara"><span id="page_214">Building</span> a foundation for living a fundamentally happy life takes deliberate effort, knowledge, practice, and habits that support happiness from within, even through dark times.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Like so many, I spent years and years as an achievement junkie, chasing happiness, finding it in small, temporary doses through external sources. While these would bring temporary highs, I would always find myself returning to a basic setting of lack and emotional mediocrity.</p>
<p class="indentpara">It wasn’t until my early thirties that I finally realized my strategy wasn’t working. I changed course, turned within, and through dedicated practice and work with some wildly inspiring mentors, I discovered how to change my core emotional setting to one of overall happiness and peace. Since then, my life has drastically changed. I no longer go through long periods of darkness, there are more good days because I have learned to create them that way, and I have a much easier time bouncing back from setbacks and hard times.</p>
<p class="indentpara">While there are many elements to building a foundation for lasting happiness, including the practices of mindfulness, gratitude, self-acceptance, and love, three important truths about happiness have stood out to me as things that often go unrecognized but, once understood, can change the way we think about and approach happiness.</p>
<p class="indentpara">The first is that <em>being sad now and then is actually part of a happy, balanced life.</em> It’s a complete myth that truly happy people never feel depressed, defeated, or distraught. On top of this, we tend to beat ourselves up for having these feelings instead of surrendering and allowing them to flow through. It’s about learning to recognize that there are valuable lessons to be learned from any situation and knowing that underneath everything you are guided and loved. It’s also about going within and feeling grateful for those opportunities and learning how to deliberately find joy, even in the smallest doses, during the tough situations.</p>
<p class="indentpara">People often ask me how I am so damn happy all the time. <span id="page_215">The</span> answer is I’m not, but I have learned to find joy, peace, and lessons within the sad times, which helps me bounce back that much faster.</p>
<p class="indentpara">The second truth is <em>that being happy is a way of life that takes deliberate hard work, concentration, and practice.</em> Sometimes, you even have to struggle and fight for it by defending personal boundaries and making hard decisions. The good news is that the more you work at it, the better you get, and it will begin to come naturally. There are happiness “muscles,” and the more you work them and keep working them, the stronger they get and the more they will support you. This is a concept I wish I’d come to know much earlier.</p>
<p class="indentpara">You can learn to be happier just like you can learn to play a game of chess. In chess, you learn and develop skills and strategies for setting yourself up for success, deciding exactly what to do when pieces are lost and how to bounce back when the going gets tough. Being happy works very much the same.</p>
<p class="indentpara11">Finally<em>, being happy is much more physical than you would think.</em> It’s true that it comes from within, but everything physical, from what you eat to physical activity to simple acts like cracking a smile, affect energy levels and brain chemistry, directly impacting our levels of happiness. Happiness is not just something we choose, find, or feel, it’s something we do.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Next time you feel down or anxiety ridden, think <em>activity</em>. Start working on a project you’ve been putting off, get some exercise, meditate, put on some music and do a happy dance, down some ultra-healthy food, even just move around a bit and do some stretching. The results are immediate. Do these things daily and your level of overall happiness will increase drastically.</p>
<p class="indentpara"><span id="page_216">Take</span> on the challenge of building yourself a solid foundation of happiness practices and skills that will be there to support you in living your happiest life. Ultimately, being happy is a conscious choice we must make on a daily (and sometimes even moment by moment) basis and a skill we must continually practice.</p>
<p class="indentpara">You can absolutely change your internal setting to one that idles regularly on happiness and joy, but it does take effort. Be willing. Make it a project. Start with small changes. Create practices that make you feel happy, keep them up, and don’t beat yourself up for not being perfect at it. We’re all works in progress, which is part of what makes life a beautiful adventure.</p>
<p class="subhead4"><em>Day 18</em></p>
<p class="subhead5">Embracing Your Creative Inner Wild Child</p>
<p class="justifypara">When I want to expand my creative mind to help me put the finishing touches on projects I’m working on, get ready for a speaking event, or bust through blocks when I’m writing, I break out colored pencils, paint, and other random art supplies and just set my creative inner wild child free.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Sometimes, when we’re feeling a little “meh” or out of touch with spirit, art—or any kind of free creative expression—can be an amazing way <em>to reconnect with our souls and unleash ideas and passions</em> that were stuck in the mud.</p>
<p class="indentpara">You don’t need to go out and buy fancy art supplies or paint like Picasso. Just grab whatever’s around—crayons, pens, sticky notes—and let your inner being guide you.</p>
<p class="indentpara">You can also grab a pen and pad of paper and create fun lists, like “stuff that inspires me in epic ways” or “ten things I want to do this month that are outside my comfort zone.”</p>
<p class="indentpara11">Just the act of doing something different and giving your inner wild child a chance to speak to you is a “<em>fanta</em>-bulous” <span id="page_217">way</span> to tap back into your light! You can also do something physical—a new kind of yoga class, a trail run, or just dance around your living room (one of my faves).</p>
<p class="indentpara">What can you do to tap into your creative side and embrace your inner wild child? Ready? Time for some creative, artistic <em>fun</em> . . . one of life’s vital nutrients!</p>
<p class="subhead4"><em>Day 19</em></p>
<p class="subhead5">Three Things to Do When Everything Sucks</p>
<p class="justifypara"><em>Sometimes life doesn’t just throw you lemons, it throws you grenades.</em> So . . . what to do on those days and weeks when it seems like everything is crap? How do you stay happy and healthy through it? I use a number of practices and ideas that help me during challenging times, and they make a tremendous difference.</p>
<p class="indentpara11">Here’s one thing I know for sure: When things don’t go your way, there will be another way . . . a better way. It just may not be clear immediately. The key is to trust, stay open, and love yourself through all of it.</p>
<p class="justifypara5"><span id="page_218">Here</span> are three things to try when it seems like everything sucks.</p>
<p class="hanging9"><span class="C527">1.</span><strong>Step into big-time self-care mode.</strong> I’m talking amp it up in major ways! We should always be in self-care and self-love mode, but when things get tough, extra self-care can make a huge difference for your health, happiness, and sanity.</p>
<p class="justifypara7">So don’t just schedule one yoga class, massage, or long walk in nature—schedule many! Indulge without guilt. Take a mental health day (trust me, the world will not end if you do this). Take hot baths with salts, call friends who make you laugh, watch a favorite movie with a “<em>gi</em>-normous” bowl of your favorite comfort food. Focus your energy on treating yourself like the fabulous rock star you are! This will not only help you release anxiety and bounce back faster, but it will also help you stay strong, positive, and productive through the storm.</p>
<p class="hanging7"><span class="C527">2.</span><strong>Go into super-healthy-eating mode.</strong> What you eat has a tremendous impact on how you feel. It affects your anxiety levels, brain chemistry, happiness meter, and of course your physical and emotional energy. I generally work to eat super-healthy most all the time. I’m all about greens, smoothies, and other healthy goodies. But I’m not always perfect in this area (and that’s okay!). However, when times get tough, I really amp up the healthy, clean eating to compensate for the extra stress my mind and body are experiencing. (This also works great when I feel like I’m fighting off a cold bug.) I hit the green juice big time, I make sure not to miss my supplements, and I cut out sugar and double up on the healthy salads and water with lemon. This not only helps me stay healthier through the tough times but it also gives me the great feeling of taking charge of something I <em>can</em> control instead of focusing on the stuff I can’t.</p>
<p class="hanging9"><span class="C527">3.</span><strong>Step outside of your regular zone. Do something different.</strong> It doesn’t have to be anything huge, dramatic, or requiring a ton of effort. Try cooking a new recipe, visiting a local museum, <span id="page_219">or</span> hitting a movie solo. One of my favorite easy things to do when I feel blah is to just jump up and dance around the room for a minute or two. Blast some disco on my iPhone and just jump around! I smile the whole time, and within a couple of minutes, I feel like a new person. This also works great for busting afternoon fatigue.</p>
<p class="justifypara9">If you’re inspired, feel free to make it epic if that’s what’s calling you! If you have the energy and time, do something totally crazy! Last week, I booked a last-minute trip and spent four days in Hawaii. I literally said “eff it!”—booked it, packed, and went. I brought my laptop so I could work on the trip and had a blast doing it. Hawaii is one of my happy places, and I came back renewed and ready to face what was waiting.</p>
<p class="justifypara7">Create a list of additional steps you can follow to take the best possible care of yourself—not just when stress levels boil over, but all the time. Then, when things are tough, kick it up a notch! Get wild. Shake it up and shake it off. Happiness, healing, and success all rely on some kind of action. This is where our power lives.</p>
<p class="subhead4"><em>Day 20</em></p>
<p class="subhead5">Avoiding Burnout: Seven Ideas for Happier Workdays</p>
<p class="justifypara">We’ve all been there: that feeling of being overwhelmed and mentally exhausted from ever-growing lists of tasks, messages, and e-mails demanding our energy and attention.</p>
<p class="indentpara">The drive for fifty-hour-plus workweeks, combined with technological advances that keep our mental gears constantly turning, has resulted in millions of overcaffeinated, sleep-deprived, burned-out employees and business owners who dream <span id="page_220">about</span> moving to an island to work at a seaside mai tai bar.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Many of us can also add several hours a week sitting in traffic to our work schedules.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Through the years of working for myself, I’ve learned that I’m much stronger and more successful with projects when I’m taking excellent care of my body, mind, and spirit. Finding this sense of harmony took much practice, and I find myself revisiting priorities on a regular basis to keep it up.</p>
<p class="indentpara">All it takes to bring more bliss and success into our professional and personal lives is to tweak our way of thinking and change a few of our own rules. After all, it’s usually our own made-up rules that hold us back, not the rules created by others.</p>
<p class="indentpara">It’s a given that working less and slowing down to a more peaceful pace at the office can lead you to a happier work life. If you feel like this isn’t an option, consider this: Slowing down, taking better care of yourself, and taking regular time off will result in more focus, extra organization, and a significant increase in mental energy. As a result, more productive days and higher-quality work will emerge. So it’s a win-win.</p>
<p class="justifypara5">Easier said than done? It may seem that way, but even making a few tiny changes can make a huge difference and provide the momentum you need for permanent positive change. Here are a few suggestions.</p>
<p class="hanging7"><span class="C527">1.</span><strong>Resist the temptation to work late unless it’s absolutely necessary.</strong> This may take practice, but it’s well worth it. Downtime must be a priority so you can be at your best for you, for your career, and for those you work with.</p>
<p class="hanging7"><span class="C527"><span id="page_221">2</span>.</span><strong>Keep an inspiration box</strong> in your office filled with special notes from friends and loved ones, as well as a few trinkets that remind you of good times. Take a break now and then when you need a pick-me-up and go through the box for instant motivation.</p>
<p class="hanging7"><span class="C527">3.</span><strong>Make a conscious effort to schedule evenings out</strong> after work every few weeks with friendly colleagues or people who inspire you. Laughter is always the best medicine, and brainstorming in a nonwork environment can be motivating as well as valuable.</p>
<p class="hanging7"><span class="C527">4.</span><strong>Change the setting on your e-mail program so it only checks for new messages every thirty minutes.</strong> Your sense of peace will increase dramatically, and you’ll get more done without the constant interruptions. While you’re at it, turn off the sound notification as well. Who needs extra noise?</p>
<p class="hanging7"><span class="C527">5.</span><strong>Schedule e-mail- and phone-free days on weekends.</strong> Sink into the joys of being unreachable for a few hours. Indulge in news-free days now and then, too.</p>
<p class="hanging7"><span class="C527">6.</span><strong>Check in with yourself</strong> on a regular basis for self-care tuneups. It can take practice to keep priorities in line.</p>
<p class="hanging7"><span class="C527">7.</span><strong>Take a little time for soul-searching.</strong> If you are truly unhappy with your job and feel this can’t be transformed, even if you shake things up a bit, then consider a change. If you feel trapped and a change doesn’t seem feasible, sit down and see if you can map out a six-month plan to make it happen. What you come up with might surprise you.</p>
<p class="indentpara">One of the most important secrets to a successful career and happier life overall is whole, balanced living. If your self “scale” is tipped heavily on the side of work, take a big step back and see where you can shave off some of the weight. The payoff will be worth it.</p>
<p class="subhead4"><em><span id="page_222">Day</span> 21</em></p>
<p class="subhead5">You Need a Bliss List</p>
<p class="justifypara">I’m a big fan of lists. I love them. Something about writing things down helps reinforce things in our minds and putting things on paper just makes them a little more . . . electric. At the start of this year, did you create a list of goals or resolutions? I always do. But this year, I realized that most of us are forgetting to create another very important, empowering list: One that can help us stay on track with happiness, stay connected to our inner voices, and help compel us to keep creating our dream lives. <em>A list of the things that light up our souls.</em></p>
<p class="indentpara">Why is this so important? Because it’s super-easy to get so focused on achieving goals and routines of everyday life that we forget to deliberately incorporate the things that really light us up, support our happiness, and drive our inspiration. And because spending time turning inward and tapping into our hearts can lead to new discoveries about our passions, what’s really important, and how we can better invite the things that truly bring joy into our lives more often.</p>
<p class="indentpara11">Anytime we’re creating a list of goals, we should also be creating a list of the things that light us up and fill our souls with bliss—a bliss list. You can even compare the two lists to see what connects to what, adding more fuel and clarity to your plan.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Personally, I love lists of ten. I create them all the time. This just seems like a doable number to me. Not overdone or underdone. <span id="page_223">But</span> sometimes just listing for as long as the ideas flow can be awesome, too.</p>
<p class="justifypara5">To help you get started, I thought I’d share my current list of ten things that light me up right now. They’re big and small, simple and complex. And to me, they’re all a “Hell yes!”</p>
<p class="hanging77"><span class="C527">1.</span>Stand-up paddleboarding</p>
<p class="hanging77"><span class="C527">2.</span>Snorkeling and free diving</p>
<p class="hanging77"><span class="C527">3.</span>Writing</p>
<p class="hanging77"><span class="C527">4.</span>Helping others to think about and approach happiness in new ways</p>
<p class="hanging77"><span class="C527">5.</span>Deep, soulful conversations with friends and family</p>
<p class="hanging77"><span class="C527">6.</span>Cooking</p>
<p class="hanging77"><span class="C527">7.</span>Gardening, fresh flowers, and growing my own food</p>
<p class="hanging77"><span class="C527">8.</span>Sunsets</p>
<p class="hanging77"><span class="C527">9.</span>Stargazing</p>
<p class="hanging10"><span class="C527">10.</span>Great music (especially live)</p>
<p class="indentpara909">Grab a pen, find a quiet spot, connect to your heart, and create your list of things that really, truly light up your soul. You might be surprised by what appears on it. <em>Let your heart speak through your pen.</em> I suggest handwriting for sure, because it stimulates the brain in ways that help with comprehension and focus. Plus, it’s just a soulful break from anything electronic, and we need as many of those as we can get.</p>
<p class="indentpara909">Create and re-create this list often. Keep it where you can see it every day. Think of it as a heart-centered meditation, an action plan, and a to-do list all in one. Of all of our lists, <em>the list of what truly lights us up and fills us with awe is the most powerful and significant.</em></p>
<p class="subhead4"><em><span id="page_224">Day</span> 22</em></p>
<p class="subhead5">Why You Must Forgive What You Think You Can’t</p>
<p class="justifypara8">Healing and true peace begins with forgiveness. Most of us know this deep down, but it can be very challenging to remember and follow through on when we feel wronged or hurt in some way. True forgiveness, whether it’s for yourself or someone else, takes strength, compassion, and the willingness to let go. It also takes knowing that the person you’re truly setting free is you. It’s like a superfood for the soul.</p>
<p class="indentpara">A number of years ago, I was coming out of a bank in Los Angeles with a friend on a sunny, carefree weekday morning when I was attacked violently by a young guy frantic for money to buy drugs. We weren’t more than ten feet from the front of the building, walking and chatting away, when I heard footsteps running up behind me. My spine froze. Somehow in that brief moment, I knew what was coming.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Before I could react, something smashed into the side of my head like a brick (actually, we’re pretty sure it was <em>literally</em> a brick). Everything went dark for a few seconds, and I could hear my friend screaming like the world was ending. I felt my bag being ripped from my shoulder and heard the footsteps again as he ran away. It almost didn’t seem real.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Later that day, lying in a cold bed at the hospital, I can clearly <span id="page_225">remember</span> the thoughts that were present in my mind. I did freak out briefly, but after the initial shock subsided, I felt strangely peaceful and thankful that I’d recover from the injuries, with the exception of a minor hearing loss in my left ear. I had what seemed like endless questions, but mostly I just wanted to know why it happened. I wanted to understand what could bring a person to that kind of lost desperation. It seemed so sad to me.</p>
<p class="indentpara">About a week later, a kind person called to say my bag had been found not far from the bank. I was anxious to go through it to see what had been left behind. There wasn’t much. A stack of my business cards, chewing gum, and ironically, a can of pepper spray (a lot of good that did for me). I pulled out one last thing—a library card from the nearby Santa Monica Library, belonging to another young woman. My heart skipped a beat.</p>
<p class="indentpara">I called information, got a number, and called her up. We bonded right away, sharing our experiences. Two different police departments were investigating our cases, and when we put the detectives on our cases in touch, they were able to piece together enough information to track the man down. I felt empowered.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Strangely, what I felt when I went to court and saw him wasn’t anger, fear, or resentment. It was empathy and compassion. The aching sadness in the energy that was coming from him was clearly visible. He knew he’d messed up his life in an epic way. He was a handsome guy who had come to L.A. to be an actor, found himself lost, depressed, and tangled in a web of addiction and mistakes. What he did to me had nothing to do with me. It was an act of fear and desperation. Some might think it strange, but a part of me felt sad for him.</p>
<p class="indentpara">After it was all over, people in my life were concerned. They thought I should be emotionally traumatized. Some had me convinced that I might be, or should at least be looking for reasons to be, so I went to a few sessions of therapy to be sure.</p>
<p class="indentpara">I found the therapy sessions unnecessary and even somewhat draining. There was nothing wrong. Nothing I needed to <span id="page_226">work</span> through. In fact, everything was right. I felt like I’d grown tremendously from the experience. I was more self-aware, had straightened out some priorities, and was grateful for having been given a powerful reminder that every moment is a precious gift. Not just every day, but every single moment.</p>
<p class="indentpara">It wasn’t until years later that I came to fully understand that the precise reason I wasn’t emotionally traumatized from the attack was because I’d <em>forgiven</em> the man who inflicted it. It was that simple. By forgiving him, I’d set myself free and was then open to receive the lessons and gifts that were offered to me through the experience. If I’d chosen to hold on to fear and anger, if I had continued to tell myself the same frightening, painful story over and over, then that’s the energy I would have gone on living with.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Was this incident a terrible thing? For sure. At the time it happened, it was horrifying. But choosing to hold on to that part of the story would be much more damaging. Because my initial reaction early on was to forgive, I was able to let go, grow, and move forward.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Forgiveness does not excuse the other person’s actions, and it doesn’t mean you have to accept them. It’s about setting yourself free from bitterness and taking back your power. It’s about letting go of negative energy that’s taking up space in your mind where high-quality thoughts should be. It’s for you. There’s a great quote from the late theologian Lewis B. Smedes that says “To forgive is to set a prisoner free and realize that prisoner was you.” This is an absolute truth.</p>
<p class="indentpara">This understanding has led me to change the stories I tell myself about many things that had caused me pain. By looking at each situation and finding empathy, understanding, and forgiveness, I’ve been able to let go of so much unnecessary junk and open up beautiful, cavernous spaces for good to come into my life. And it has.</p>
<p class="indentpara">There are three great ways to begin the process of forgiving.</p>
<p class="indentpara">First, know that the forgiveness is in no way condoning what <span id="page_227">was</span> done. It has everything to do with you, and really not much at all to do with the other person. It’s about letting go of pain and resentment, which is like poison to the spirit. It’s about setting yourself free. Think of forgiveness as a spiritual superfood. It’s an emotional detox.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Second, understand that whatever the person did, the root cause underneath everything was very likely fear. People so often act out of fear, and when we see this, it can sometimes make a situation a bit easier to digest because acting out of fear is something we all understand. It’s about compassion. This also applies when it comes to forgiving yourself.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Finally, shift the way you look at a situation. A change in perception is amazingly freeing. Look for the good, even the smallest molecule, that came out of it: a lesson, an experience, a fire to create a positive change. Right after my experience, I was so thankful that I was alive that just the feeling of gratitude was the first bit of light I was able to see. It helped me open up. Be willing to see the whole thing, all of it, from a different point of view and you’ll crack it open so the sun can begin to shine in. This is also a good one when you need to forgive yourself.</p>
<p class="indentpara">After the trial, the young guy in my case was sentenced to nine years in prison. I don’t know what happened to him after he got out, but wherever he is, I do hope he has found peace and healing. It may sound crazy, but I send him love. And I hope he has forgiven himself. Forgive, be love, let the light in, and set yourself free. You deserve it.</p>
<p class="subhead4"><em>Day 23</em></p>
<p class="subhead5">Why You’re Exactly Where You Should Be</p>
<p class="justifypara">Sometimes, the place we’re in can be a major bummer. Things like losing a job, moving to a new place, or moving on from a <span id="page_228">relationship</span> can spin us into a place of wanting to force everything to be okay, right now, when it simply can’t. Accepting what is, turning inward, and giving yourself time to allow things to flow on their own will empower you to make the right choices and open your heart and mind up to amazing opportunities that may come your way.</p>
<p class="indentpara11">I can remember a time a while back when it felt like so many things in my life were in transition. While most of it was great and much needed, change is still not always easy. One of the most important things I remind myself of when things feel off track is that it’s not necessary to have all the answers right away and that they’ll come when the time is right, every time.</p>
<p class="indentpara">When the pressure is off to force answers before they’re ready to appear, and I give myself permission to be exactly where I am without stressing about tomorrow, it’s pretty amazing how much better I feel. It also helps things unfold exactly as they’re meant to without diversions. I also find myself able to then simply <em>be in the moment and embrace the journey.</em></p>
<p class="indentpara">This isn’t to say that it’s not important to think things through and take action when you feel called. It’s basically to say that if you’re thinking about things and clear answers aren’t coming to you, then it’s perfectly okay to give yourself permission <em>not</em> to know. <em>To tread water for a bit.</em> Everything becomes crystal clear in its own time. Sometimes, it just takes a while, and it may be longer than you’d like it to be.</p>
<p class="indentpara"><span id="page_229">This</span> is also one of the most important things I find myself reminding clients of when I’m coaching—that knowing <em>you’re exactly where you should be in this moment</em> and releasing the need to struggle for immediate answers will take the pressure off and help things flow just as they’re meant to. It will also keep you more open to new roads that may not have appeared for you if you hadn’t stopped to take a breath.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Even positive change can be challenging. Decisions about making a change in your career, moving to a new pad, launching a new project, going back to school . . . all these are great, and at the same time can be pretty overwhelming if we allow them to be. This is also a time to allow answers and guidance to come organically.</p>
<p class="indentpara">During this time, it’s also important to be kind to yourself and forgiving of yourself, and to think about treating yourself the same way you would treat a good friend going through the same situation. Know that what got you into this place serves a purpose, even if the purpose hasn’t revealed itself yet.</p>
<p class="indentpara">So here’s the deal. Give yourself permission to not have all the answers, to take the time you need, and to feel whatever it is you’re feeling. Be easy on yourself. Know that everything will happen in its own time, and your job is to make the best of the ride—to turn it into an adventure. This is how you’ll land on your feet, every time.</p>
<p class="subhead4"><em>Day 24</em></p>
<p class="subhead5">Relationships and Life: Here’s the Likely Answer When You Feel Like Something’s Missing</p>
<p class="justifypara">“Only what you have not given can be lacking in any situation.” This is an idea from <em>A Course in Miracles</em> that I’m breathing <span id="page_230">in</span> this week, and have numerous times before. It’s a powerful truth that can be challenging to accept because it shows us that we must look at what <em>we</em> are not offering in any situation, and that we must take responsibility. Amp up the faith. That in fact, what we give more of is what we will receive more of in return.</p>
<p class="indentpara">For me, this concept is a reminder to always see things from a place of love. It’s a reminder to give even more love and to <em>be</em> love. This creates big shifts in perception that result in miracles. It also prompts me to turn inward when looking to fill in what’s missing in any situation. The answer, and the call to action, is always right there.</p>
<p class="indentpara">This idea is the core place from which to examine any area of our lives that we feel is lacking, especially in relationships. It will always offer the answer we seek when asking how we can improve a situation. In any relationship, if we want more understanding, we must be more understanding. If we want more love, we must give more love and be more loving. If we’re looking for more joy and laughter, we must be joy and shine our light to bring laughter to others. And the list goes on.</p>
<p class="indentpara">When I look back on some of my relationships that crashed and burned or endured tremendous challenges, I now see many of those situations so much more clearly. How could I expect someone to give it their all when there were parts of me that I wasn’t making available? How could I expect someone to let their walls come down when I myself had concrete walls in place? How could I expect someone to open up to feeling complete love for me when I myself was allowing fear to hold me back from fully expressing my love? I was often frustrated; feeling like another person wasn’t open to evolving a relationship when the truth was, it was me who wasn’t open. I wasn’t <em>being</em> what I was seeking.</p>
<p class="indentpara">This is not to say that every single relationship has the potential to be healthy or right. Every relationship<em>,</em> however, is an opportunity to learn and grow. So, in toxic or abusive situations, <span id="page_231">what’s</span> lacking may be the fact that the relationship needs to come to an end but is still ongoing. Therefore, the “what more can I give” becomes the act of letting go. Walking away actually becomes an act of love, as does forgiving and viewing the other person with compassion.</p>
<p class="indentpara11">So I invite you to join me in asking this powerful question when facing a challenge or struggle, or when seeking a solution in any situation: “What more can I give?” Then be open to allowing your inner voice to share the honest truth with you. Be willing to take responsibility for that which you’re not giving, and then open up to giving freely with all your heart. Being willing to do this has changed so much for me and will continue to do so. It can transform, grow, and even save relationships, and it can definitely create big-time growth within <em>you</em>.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Give, take ownership, and shift the way you’re viewing the situation. Be willing to go within and then step outside your comfort zone in order to create true, miraculous change. This is where it all begins.</p>
<p class="subhead4"><em>Day 25</em></p>
<p class="subhead5">Expect Amazing Things—How Expectations Shape Your Days</p>
<p class="justifypara">Much of the way we experience our day comes from what we expect of it. Expect amazing things today and it will be. Expect a bad day and that’s pretty much what you’ll get. It’s pretty simple.</p>
<p class="indentpara"><span id="page_232">A</span> while back, I took a day off to go stand-up paddleboarding in Malibu. It was totally delicious. The water was gorgeous, the sun was shining, and a pod of dolphins swam by. I’d looked forward to this for days.</p>
<p class="indentpara">I can tell you this for sure the one thing that helped make it so great was that I <em>expected</em> it to be! In the days leading up to going, I was making statements (affirmations, really) like “I’m going paddleboarding on Thursday. It’s going to be amazing!”</p>
<p class="indentpara">I grew up with a major fear of the ocean. I wouldn’t even go in past my knees. For a Southern California girl, you can imagine this might be a bit of an issue. Years ago, I finally set my mind to overcoming the fear, and now I’m passionate about water sports. I snorkel, free dive, surf, and swim. Anywhere in or near the ocean is a very happy place for me! But to be honest, there is still a sneaky little voice inside of me that will creep in and stir up anxiety when I’m faced with going into the open ocean far from the shore.</p>
<p class="indentpara11">Before my day off for paddleboarding in Malibu, that annoying little voice was tempting me to make statements like “I’m a little nervous I might fall in” or “Going that far from the shore can be scary.” I guarantee if that were the mind-set I’d been in prior to hitting the water, it would have drastically changed my experience. But I chose to ignore those negative, limiting thoughts and instead chose to expect a fantastic experience. And it was.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Our expectations for the day usually begin in the morning. When you wake up, be conscious about the statements you’re making and the thoughts you’re choosing about the day ahead. If you’re thinking, “That marketing meeting this afternoon is <span id="page_233">going</span> to suck big time,” you’re not only setting yourself up for a negative experience, you’re also putting out low vibrations that affect other aspects of life, too. Changing your outlook and expectations can literally change what you experience. And aligning your expectations with your positive intentions gives you that much more momentum.</p>
<p class="indentpara">This isn’t to say everything will always turn out the way we expect it to. That would be boring! It’s also not to say having powerful, positive expectations will never lead to disappointment. That happens sometimes, and there are always lessons to be received there. This is just to say our expectations play a huge role in shaping the way we live—the richness, the light, the growth, and the joy.</p>
<p class="indentpara">So when it comes to creating a fantastic life, be sure to add setting high-quality, positive expectations to your happiness toolbox. It’s a powerful thing to expect awesomeness. To expect fantastic experiences. Expect an amazing, delicious, joyful life—and it will be.</p>
<p class="subhead4"><em>Day 26</em></p>
<p class="subhead5">Why Being a Little Badass Can Be Blissful</p>
<p class="justifypara">I can remember a time when fear about what others would think of me would keep me from expressing my opinion or standing up for myself, even in situations where I should have been putting up a serious fight for what I believed was right. I never had any problem coming out swinging in defense of others, but when I had to defend myself, that was another story. The same fears held me back when it came to busting out of my comfort zone or breaking rules (even the ones that just <em>ask</em> to be broken).</p>
<p class="indentpara">A few years ago, I finally drew a line and decided to set free and embrace my inner badass. I must tell you, she’s pretty freaking <span id="page_234">cool.</span> What I’ve come to know is that when you say what’s on your mind, take risks, and express what you desire in a cool, clear, respectful way, you can create powerful change, get more of what you want, and transform potentially negative encounters into positive experiences.</p>
<p class="indentpara">When something doesn’t feel right, when you’re not being treated with respect and kindness, or when someone does something that you feel is completely out of line, don’t be afraid to release your inner badass and tell it like you see it (with grace, of course). You’ll be doing yourself a huge favor. And by offering your authentic self and speaking your truth, you’re doing a service for others involved as well. The response is often surprisingly positive and empowering.</p>
<p class="indentpara">I’ve also learned through experience that rocking a bit of moxie when breaking rules or stepping outside of your safe zone can also bring on amazing experiences that may have otherwise been missed. Willingness to take risks and to brave feeling out of your element can spark huge growth and lead to exhilarating experiences you’ll never forget.</p>
<p class="indentpara11">Until my midtwenties, I was terrified of swimming in the ocean. Then on a trip to Mexico, I was so overwhelmed by the water’s beauty that I dedicated myself to breaking free of a lifelong fear and experiencing what it was like to be a part of that amazing beauty. I started slowly, with someone holding on to me as I went in, but it wasn’t long before I was swimming like a fish. Releasing that fear opened up an awesome new world. Today, I’m super-passionate about the ocean and its conservation. I’ve learned to surf, dive, and even swim with sharks (yup . . . in the cage—seriously badass).</p>
<p class="indentpara"><span id="page_235">So</span> the next time you’re tempted to shy away from speaking what’s on your mind or trying something that would usually have you running the other way, rethink the opportunity and the good things that might be waiting for you. Know that chances for fantastic breakthroughs can sometimes come disguised as uncomfortable situations.</p>
<p class="indentpara">The freedom that comes from trying something new, releasing the fear of what others might think, and even breaking the rules now and then is fiercely amazing. When you believe in yourself and treat yourself like the remarkable, capable person you are, you’ll put yourself in a place to excel and be of the highest possible service to yourself and to the world. Spread your wings, say it like you mean it, and don’t be afraid to shine. You are a badass, and open doors are waiting.</p>
<p class="subhead4"><em>Day 27</em></p>
<p class="subhead5">Are You Too Hard on Yourself?</p>
<p class="justifypara">So I’ve been pretty hard on myself lately. I’ve been letting that get-it-all-done-now voice inside me bug me to no end. I’ve been putting a lot of pressure on myself to blog more, work on my book more, get more done, juggle more projects, and on it goes. I had to put the brakes on this ridiculousness!</p>
<p class="indentpara11">Every now and then, we have to stop and remind ourselves that we are enough, just as we are, we are always doing the best we can, and everything will come together just fine. When we treat ourselves with love and compassion, we are actually <em>more</em> productive and can think more clearly than when we are hard on ourselves! Plus, we have a lot more fun!</p>
<p class="indentpara"><span id="page_236">Take</span> a moment right now to breathe in and give yourself credit for how amazing you are. Remind yourself that <em>you are enough,</em> that you’re doing the best you can. Then do something kind for yourself—even something small that just takes a minute. <em>Then</em> you can check back in to your day. Do this regularly (set a reminder in your phone if you feel inspired<em>). Kindness, compassion, and love for yourself make up a huge part of the foundation for your happiest life.</em></p>

<p class="subhead5">Five Secrets for Successful Business Networking (and Making Friends, Too)</p>
<p class="justifypara">With the huge growth over the last few years of social media platforms and online business networking, the popularity of in-person networking events has also increased, offering infinite opportunities for those who take the initiative to venture out and see what’s happening in the world away from the computer screen.</p>
<p class="indentpara">In addition to large networking organizations and general one-size-fits-all networking events, new groups that focus on particular niches or industries are popping up all the time, providing more targeted opportunities for meeting new contacts, mentors, and potential clients. A newer concept in networking circles and events brings trendsetting business leaders and entrepreneurs together with brands, venues, and organizations that are looking to gain exposure with just that crowd, creating a win-win for all.</p>
<p class="indentpara">So how do the savviest networkers make the most of all these opportunities? They follow a few key practices that greatly increase the value of what they take away, as well as what they have to offer others they meet.</p>
<p class="justifypara5"><span id="page_237">Through</span> my years of organizing all kinds of events, working with clients on networking and business building, and, honestly, running into people at networking events who’ve made me want to run for the hills, I’ve identified a few practices regularly used by super-successful and dynamic people. Add these to your networking savoir faire, and you’ll begin to see big results.</p>
<p class="hanging7"><span class="C527">1.</span>Approach each event and the people you meet from the standpoint of “What can I give?” rather than “What can I get?” When you genuinely look to be of service to others, you will be amazed by the doors that will open for you.</p>
<p class="hanging7"><span class="C527">2.</span>Don’t hand someone your business card within the first two minutes of meeting in an attempt to manufacture a contact without even knowing anything about the person. Random card dropping is generally not productive and can be perceived as disingenuous. More times than not, your card will end up in the circular file. There are rare exceptions to this, so just let your intuition guide you. Instead spend time speaking to those you meet. Find out what they do, where they’re from, and even what they like to do outside of business. Be genuinely, enthusiastically interested in people, and quality opportunities, great connections, and even new friendships will come naturally.</p>
<p class="hanging7"><span class="C527">3.</span>When someone gives you his or her business card, think of it as a great compliment. Follow the traditional Japanese custom of treating the card, and therefore the person, with great respect. Instead of immediately shoving it in your pocket or handbag, study the card and then hold it with both hands while you continue your conversation. If you spot something on the card that inspires a question or comment, even better. When the time is right, find a quiet way to place the card in a safe spot.</p>
<p class="hanging7"><span class="C527">4.</span>Give the person or people you are talking to your full attention. This may sound like a no-brainer, but think of all the people whose eyes are glancing at their phones or darting <span id="page_238">around</span> the room to see who else is there while they’re half listening to the people they’ve just met. People pick up on this immediately, and they will remember. It’s much more valuable and productive to place your complete focus on the opportunity before you. It’s also courteous. If there are other people worth meeting at the same event, you can create that opportunity by finding polite ways to move on when the time is just right. That’s the time to be looking for whom you’d like to meet next.</p>
<p class="hanging7"><span class="C527">5.</span>Your smile is one of your greatest commodities. It’s absolutely 100 percent true, and I can’t stress it enough. A warm, authentic smile will open more doors than the shiniest background or business card. Your smile is your greatest chance to make a sparkling impression.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Whether you’re just starting out in your career, looking to make new friends, launching a new business, or advancing in your profession, effective networking is one of the most important skills you can possess. Learn how to work it in creative, dynamic ways and it will be one of your most valuable keys to greater success in anything you dream to accomplish.</p>
<p class="subhead4"><em>Day 29</em></p>
<p class="subhead5">Are You Shrinking to Fit? Why the Uncensored You Is Awesome!</p>
<p class="justifypara">I’ve become very clear on something lately. Much of the damage and frustration that occurs in any relationship or situation in <span id="page_239">our</span> lives comes from one thing: making ourselves smaller to fit into it.</p>
<p class="indentpara11">Playing it small and safe in life and in relationships can be like a low-grade fever or a slow-moving infection. You don’t realize it’s happening until you actually go for a checkup and discover it’s there. You’ve been puttering along just fine as is. But the damage is happening, and something must be done before it gets serious.</p>
<p class="indentpara">If you’re holding back and dimming your light out of fear that you may be too bold, say or do the wrong thing, be rejected, or rock the boat, you’re shrinking yourself and your life, as well as denying the world—and yourself—your true, amazing gifts.</p>
<p class="indentpara">I can remember a past relationship where I totally did this. I would bite my tongue to avoid conflict, turn down opportunities that I thought he wouldn’t approve of, and worst of all, avoid taking risks and chances in my business because of fear that if I failed, I would disappoint him. And none of this had anything to do with him. It was all my doing. In fact, it was so unfair to him because the person he wanted to be with was <em>me</em>. Not a smaller version of me. Not the PG-rated version of me. He didn’t want the “lite” version of me; he wanted the <em>light</em> version of me!</p>
<p class="indentpara">So here’s the deal. You are good enough. You’re amazing, in fact. Your thoughts and dreams are valid and powerful. Express and pursue them daringly. The greatest change-makers are the <span id="page_240">ones</span> who aren’t afraid to ruffle a few feathers along their paths. <em>What you’re capable of if you free yourself to be the complete, uncensored you may blow your mind.</em> This is also the path to your happiest, most peaceful self.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Forget the critics. Let go of the fear of screwing up—know that it’s part of making great things happen. Be willing to step out of your own way and take chances. Trust that the universe is there to support you.</p>
<p class="indentpara">The world and the people in your life are in great need of your light. You, in all your YOUness, are exactly why people will want to work with you, be in relationships with you, and support you. If you begin to play small, purposely downplay your dreams and desires, and label yourself as “shrink to fit,” you’re not doing them—or yourself—any favors.</p>
<p class="indentpara">I believe what we all need to do is train ourselves to regularly check in with our inner voices to be sure we’re being true to our whole selves and what we really, truly, deeply desire. Shrinking ourselves to fit into different situations can be a defense habit that comes to us automatically and can be a tough one to recognize and take charge of. It sure was for me. What I finally realized was that I was more concerned about the approval of others than I was about achieving my own dreams and desires.</p>
<p class="indentpara">The good news is that just like shifting any habit or pattern, by becoming conscious of the tendency to fall into the shrinking state of being, we can change the direction of our sails and head back to where the sun is shining.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Creating this shift may mean some of the people and situations in our lives that are not in alignment with our best lives and highest purposes fall away, which can be very hard at times. The key is to fully trust what’s truly meant for you will remain, and that space will be created for the awesome.</p>
<p class="indentpara">By fully committing yourself to be your brightest, follow your dreams, and be your authentic, passionate self in every area of <span id="page_241">your</span> life, you’ll naturally attract the relationships and opportunities that will lift you up, back you up, and empower you. Awesome doors will begin to fly open and invite you in. Life will flow with much more ease and clarity. This is the cycle of an authentic, powerful, joyful life.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Where in your life are you shrinking to fit? Playing small? Containing your voice? It’s time to set your full, beautiful, dynamic self completely and totally free. Your soul and the world will be grateful.</p>
<p class="subhead4"><em>Day 30</em></p>
<p class="subhead5">Three Ways to Be Happier Now</p>
<p class="justifypara">I really love my life! It wasn’t always that way. It took a lot of hard work, important lessons, and many shifts in perception to get to this place. I’ve learned to step into myself and who I truly am, and I’ve learned to get out of my own way.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Something else I learned along the way is that all human beings have a single life purpose in common. That purpose is to be happy. For a big part of my life, I spent so much time struggling, trying to figure out how to feel happier, to get to a happier place, or to get my hands around the next thing or achievement that would “make me happy.” It never seemed to work. I know now that what I didn’t do was just allow myself to simply be happy right then and there.</p>
<p class="indentpara">The truth is that authentic happiness and inner peace lies in the present moment, right now, within us, waiting and longing to be embraced. Once I finally understood this idea, my life changed profoundly.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Along my own journey to be happy, I discovered a number of ideas and tools to assist in embracing the joy that is always available in each moment. There are three, in particular, I’ve found to be fantastically helpful.</p>
<p class="indentpara"><span id="page_242">First,</span> view happiness as a skill and as an activity and not just as a feeling but also as something we take active part in doing and creating. Aristotle said “Happiness is a state of activity.” This notion entirely changed my perception. When we’re in the midst of actively doing something we enjoy, being of service to others, or taking part in something healthful like exercise, meditation, or munching down a big salad, we feel happy and empowered. This is doing happiness. It’s all about choosing how we create and live each moment.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Second, rethink mornings. Our thoughts have a deep impact on our world. I remember a time when I was waking up each day in a place of complete lack, swimming in negative, limiting thoughts that left me forcing myself to get out of bed with a heavy heart on a regular basis. Skipping breakfast, loading up on caffeine, and rushing to get out the door on time didn’t help. I was carrying that nasty energy with me into the day ahead.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Once I realized that the way I was starting my day was creating the path for the rest of it, I understood how extremely important it is to make mornings as positive as possible. I’ve now changed my thoughts in the mornings to focus on the positive, and I’ve changed my routine to include plenty of time, a decent breakfast, and reading uplifting posts from my favorite blogs. It’s worked wonders. My days, and my life, have radically improved.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Finally, open yourself to recognize and receive the limitless joy, comfort, and wonder that is all around at every moment in the little things. This is excellent everyday practice, but it’s especially helpful during challenging times. It’s easy to get so caught up in focusing on the big stuff in life we miss the bliss that can be found in all the amazing, beautiful small things, which actually aren’t small at all.</p>
<p class="indentpara11">The orchid plant in my office is a great example. Sometimes, when I’m feeling a bit stressed, I focus on the remarkable intricacy <span id="page_243">and</span> beauty of this living miracle, and it really puts things in perspective. I also have a super-cute glass flying pig on my desk to remind me to say “no” when I need to. It makes me smile every time I look at it and serves as a great reminder to be true to myself. That little winged pig has a big impact.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Changing the way we perceive happiness can completely transform the way we experience it, as well as greatly increase its presence. I believe the same applies to balance, love, and passion. It’s all about choice, thoughts, and taking an active role in doing, creating, recognizing, and embracing. Your happiest place is right here, right now—in this moment. Live it. Rock it. Make it beautiful.</p>
