<p class="centerpara"><span id="page_i">Kristi</span> Ling’s willingness to share her story and be a living example of what science is telling us—that we can train ourselves to be happy—shows us all that happiness is always available if we’re willing to deliberately <em>do</em> it rather than just wait around for it.</p>
<p class="centerpara1"><em>—Arielle Ford, author of</em> Turn Your Mate into Your Soulmate</p>
<p class="centerpara2">As a firm believer in pro-active participation in every aspect of our lives, I love the way Kristi Ling has extended this philosophy to our pursuit of happiness. It’s all about personal responsibility, greater awareness, and taking positive action. <em>Operation Happiness</em> is the perfect road map!</p>
<p class="centerpara1"><em>—Susan Wilking Horan, wellness advocate and bestselling author of</em> The Single Source Cancer Course</p>
<p class="centerpara2">Never has a book like <em>Operation Happiness</em> been more relevant! At a time when we’re searching for the next “like,” or external validation, Kristi Ling teaches us that happiness is a skill and ultimately our responsibility to learn and master.</p>
