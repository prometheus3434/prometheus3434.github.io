<p class="chhead2">The Five Key Happiness Mind-Sets</p>
<p class="justifypara"><span class="fontsize">I’m one of those</span> rare people who can remember back to the very early days of their lives. It sounds crazy, I know, but I can literally remember learning to walk. I have a clear memory of puttering around alone in my grandparents’ trailer at one year old in my pale yellow walker with colored beads across the front, curious about the world. I remember pushing myself with my tiny hand off the wood paneling of the lower cabinets, attempting to make my way toward the door so I could scoot outside to where I heard the sounds of my parents and grandparents talking.</p>
<p class="indentpara">As I pushed back off the cabinet, I lost my footing, along with control of the walker, and awkwardly tumbled right out the door, down the step, and onto the ground. I let out a high-pitched wail, of which I can still hear the sound. I was a little banged up, but serious injury had been eluded, thankfully. My grandmother quickly ran over and picked me up, attempting to soothe me with her touch and voice. The last thing I remember from that scenario, funny enough, is the sound of them all arguing. Of course, I have no idea what they were saying; I just remember the tone and the chatter. Very likely a heated discussion about who was to blame for my calamity.</p>
<p class="indentpara">What’s really nuts is that I can remember what I was thinking <span id="page_22">throughout</span> this entire episode, kind of like the way you remember what you were thinking in one of those super-clear dreams. We honestly don’t give babies enough credit. They’re very aware of what’s going on around them, they can employ logic, and they have a loud inner voice. I recall the actual thought—and feeling—I had the moment I lost my footing and realized I was going to roll out the door. It was something along the lines of . . . “Oh, shit!”—only it was more like “Wha-a-a-a-a!” since I didn’t have complex language skills yet, but it meant the same thing.</p>
<p class="indentpara">What really blows me away about the walker debacle is not the memory of the scary moment when I fell out the door, but the minute or two before that, when I was just pushing myself around peacefully. Seriously, when I really think about this, it gives me chills! I can recall a few moments of my pure, clear, serene state of mind. A feeling of complete wonder and curiosity about the world. No stress. No past. No judgments. No pain. No fear. No limits. Just love.</p>
<p class="indentpara">When we’re young children, this is our natural state of being. But as life unfolds and things happen, we largely lose touch with our true, pure nature of peace, wonder, joy, and love. Few people ever make it back anywhere close to that miraculous, unadulterated state. That’s the path I’d like to illuminate in this chapter. Not just to discuss the ideas of love, forgiveness, compassion, kindness, and the fact that anything is possible—we’re all aware that these are wonderful and powerful—but to have a meaningful conversation about how we can <em>become</em> them. This is where the real magic happens.</p>
<p class="subhead"><strong>YOUR BRAIN IS YOUR BFF</strong></p>
<p class="justifypara">Let’s get scientific for a minute and chat about a wildly amazing miracle called <em>neuroplasticity</em>. In a way, it’s your key to everything this book is about. Learning how this works was one of my biggest breakthroughs in fully understanding exactly how one can go about creating lasting, sustainable happiness, love, and inner peace. It has everything to do with the way our brains work.</p>
<p class="indentpara"><span id="page_23">The</span> simple way to explain neuroplasticity is that it’s your brain’s ability to change its programming in your synapses (signal transmitters) and neural pathways (information vehicles). This occurs through deliberate and consistent changes in your thoughts, behaviors, emotions, physical habits, and even your environment. In other words, you are in control. You can literally <em>undo</em> years of negative limiting programming and rewire your brain’s default, automatic settings to happiness and positivity! Yes, you can! Isn’t that incredible?</p>
<p class="indentpara">Much of what they taught us about our brains in science class has been overturned in the past couple of decades, and researchers have discovered astonishing scientific evidence that the old saying “You can do anything you set your mind to” is actually true!</p>
<p class="indentpara">Scientists once believed that after our first few years, our brains were basically set and would function and remain largely the same for the rest of our lives. But that old-school way of thinking has been changed by extensive research that shows our brains are constantly changing and by the amazing realization that we can control and take charge of many of those changes on multiple levels, even down to our cells.</p>
<p class="indentpara">When I learned about neuroplasticity and then linked it with the profound transformation I experienced through dedicating myself completely to happiness and positive change while recovering from my illness back in 2008, it all fell into place. Through resolute dedication and a series of deliberate, positive, consistent changes in a number of areas, you can transform your life into a happy, supportive, joy-filled place. It’s a scientific fact. How extraordinary!</p>
<p class="justifypara1"><span id="page_24">This</span> is amazing, life-changing news for anyone who has ever felt like they just weren’t “wired” for consistent, lasting happiness. You can completely rewire your natural state and default mind-sets to automatically operate from a foundation of happiness, peace, love, and positivity. We all have the power to create our own beautiful brain makeover!</p>
<p class="indentpara">In one study conducted by researchers from Massachusetts General Hospital, sixteen participants spent eight weeks in a mindfulness-based stress-reduction program at the University of Massachusetts Medical School Center for Mindfulness. They went to weekly meetings, which included a practice of mindfulness meditation (focusing on nonjudgmental awareness of feelings, sensations, and state of mind). They also practiced mindfulness exercises daily on their own using guided meditation recordings for an average of twenty-seven minutes for the eight-week period. At the end of the study, the participants reported significant improvements.</p>
<p class="indentpara">When the researchers reviewed the MR (magnetic resonance) images taken of the brain structure of the sixteen participants two weeks before the study began and then again two weeks afterward, they found notable changes in the regions of the brain known to be important for learning, memory, self-awareness, compassion, empathy, and introspection. Participants also reported significant decreases in stress, which correlated with readings on the brain images that showed reduced gray-matter density in the amygdala, the part of the brain that plays a large role in anxiety, stress, and emotional reactions.</p>
<p class="indentpara">The people who took part in this study weren’t just feeling significantly better because they’d been chilling out a lot (although as we know there’s much to be said about ample time for relaxation and positive thinking); they actually changed their brains! Think about the power in that! No chemicals, no unrealistic lifestyle changes, no massive time commitment . . . and they literally created scientific transformation in the quality of their lives. The research<span id="page_25">ers</span> also suggested that longer-term effort with the mindfulness practices could result in even more positive changes.</p>
<p class="indentpara">You don’t need to take part in a study to start working on this for yourself; just your own Operation Happiness. By absolutely knowing that through consistent practice and unwavering dedication to the ideas, tools, and concepts in this book that resonate with your heart, and through others you’ll discover on your journey, you’ll create incredible changes in the way your brain works that will support you in extraordinary ways for the rest of your life. Any limiting beliefs about the way you’re wired, your ability to change, and the power your brain has to shape your world are just that—limiting beliefs. The truth is that your brain is a beautiful, remarkable, malleable miracle—and with few exceptions, you’re in charge.</p>
<p class="indentpara">With conscious effort, practice, and consistent, deliberate intention, it’s possible to bring ourselves to an empowered place where we largely embody and <em>naturally operate from</em> the key happiness mind-sets we’ll chat about in this chapter: <em>love, forgiveness, compassion, kindness,</em> and <em>anything is possible</em>. A truly light-filled way of being. Ready to get going? Let’s do this!</p>
<p class="subhead"><strong>THE IMPORTANCE OF GRATITUDE</strong></p>
<p class="justifypara">Before we get into the five key happiness mind-sets, I want to share with you a bit on gratitude. Gratitude is a magical, tangible daily practice that can transform your life, elevate your positive energy, and support your happiness like nothing else can. It’s not just about being thankful; living in a perpetual state of gratitude is an actual state of being. It’s a way of life so powerful it amplifies all joy, love, forgiveness, compassion, and a panoply of other brilliant treasures.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Gratitude multiplies gratitude, so the more you allow yourself to feel grateful for things in your life—good and bad, large and tiny—the more gratitude you will feel running through your <span id="page_26">veins.</span> You can actually feel a physical shift inside when you enter a state of deep gratitude. Once you become accustomed to that shift, you’ll want to be in that space as often as possible. It truly is one of the best experiences on earth, and we can create it anytime we choose.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Gratitude is a powerful thread connecting all the key happiness mind-sets. It can support and magnify each one to bring them to their highest levels. As you dive into the rest of this chapter, I encourage you to begin cultivating deep gratitude—really feeling it—and allowing it to unfold within you like a grand flower blooming.</p>
<p class="indentpara">A great way to do this is to keep a gratitude journal. In it, write down a few things each day you’re grateful for. It could be several things, or just one or two you want to focus on that day. This is a luminous, transformative practice. In fact, I would even suggest putting this book down for a few minutes and starting one right now. It will help open you more fully to creating the shifts we’ll talk about in this chapter, and it will serve as an opportunity to pause and recognize how truly amazing this life is. Joy rises from gratitude.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Now we’ll dig in! I encourage you to view the vital mind-sets outlined here as your <em>elements in a new way of being</em>—a new lifestyle of default settings that your heart and mind will automatically turn to for insight and guidance in all scenarios. The objective is to practice shifting to them at every opportunity, even when it feels uncomfortable, until they become a dominant part of the natural way your mind works. This will not just expand the presence of these mind-sets within your brain and your heart, but it will also help to edge out some of the old mind-sets and limiting beliefs that have been hindering your happiness up until now. It will essentially change the lens through which you see the world.</p>
<p class="indentpara">We’ll start with love. Like gratitude, love is a through line that can support the other mind-sets, which is why it’s first and also <span id="page_27">why</span> I write the most about it. <em>Love is the single most powerful force in the universe.</em></p>
<p class="subhead"><strong>HAPPINESS MIND-SET #1: LOVE</strong></p>
<p class="justifypara">Love is the most remarkable, pure, empowering place to live from. Do all things from a place of pure love, and your world will change profoundly.</p>
<p class="subhead1"><strong>Acting and Reacting from a Place of Love</strong></p>
<p class="justifypara">It’s so easy to act and react from places other than love, when the truth is that love is the most important part of the foundation of every single thing we do. Actions without a foundation of love lack positive momentum and energy and are almost always clearly noticeable, yet they are common. Some examples include snapping at a loved one for leaving socks on the floor, verbally or mentally beating ourselves up for any reason, or criticizing someone starting with words like “You always . . .” and “Can’t you just . . . .” Creating a shift to consistently act from love—most if not all of the time—is where to begin rewiring your energy and anchoring your foundation for happiness.</p>
<p class="indentpara">This may be a bit of a challenge at first. I remember a time when, although love was present in my life, my default places to start most anything were fear, anxiety, fatigue, or apathy—not the greatest places to live or act from. The good news is that I discovered through my journey that the more we teach ourselves to practice living and acting from love, as well as from the other mind-sets outlined in this chapter, the less room there will be for unwanted negative states to creep in, and the more we’ll notice them and give them the boot when they do.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Think of your mind (and even your whole life!) as a closet. In this book, we’re basically looking to clean out all the stuff that no longer fits or serves you and fill those spaces with fabulous things <span id="page_28">that</span> suit you perfectly and make you feel amazing. We’re going to shift the vibes from which you operate.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Begin each morning by consciously shifting into and very deliberately remaining in a loving mind-set toward every action and interaction, and especially toward yourself. Gently correct your course when you feel yourself shifting away from it. This will profoundly change the way you experience your life and the way others experience you.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Dedicate yourself long enough to doing this with great awareness on a daily basis, and you will build the default mind-set of love naturally and with ease. You’ll likely even feel a physical shift in your being. You’ll begin to notice shifts in the way you think about and view different things, including other people. Believe it or not, some people who used to really annoy you may not be so annoying anymore, because you’re looking at them from a place of love and acceptance rather than <em>expecting</em> that they’re going to be annoying or that they should in some way be different. Some of your longtime core beliefs may even shift, and some of your priorities likely will, too.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Here’s an example. My good friend Lisa called me to share that a woman in her office was driving her absolutely bananas. “I can’t stand her! She’s so mean to everyone!” Lisa was totally stressed out because this woman’s attitude was making it hard for her to get up and go to work in the morning. She asked me for advice.</p>
<p class="indentpara">“Does she seem like a happy person?” I asked, already knowing the answer.</p>
<p class="indentpara">“Hell no! She’s grouchy and negative. I don’t even know why they keep her working there. She makes negative comments and nitpicks at everyone’s faults.”</p>
<p class="indentpara">“It sounds to me like this woman is very unhappy and may be really hurting inside,” I said. “What if she’s desperate for love and acceptance, and she’s stuck in a cycle of negativity and anger because she’s full of sadness, resentment, and lack of self-love?” I gave Lisa a few seconds to ponder this.</p>
<p class="indentpara"><span id="page_29">“</span>Wow. I never thought of it that way. That’s kind of sad. She always looks tired and, yeah, under all that crap, she does seem more sad than angry, I think.”</p>
<p class="indentpara">I gave her a little challenge. “Okay, this might be hard at first, but just go with it. Tap into feeling love and compassion in your heart for this woman, who is clearly in pain. Sometimes, the people who are hardest to love are the ones who need it most. Try smiling brightly at her first thing tomorrow morning and pay her a compliment. If her response is bitchy, let it go like water off a duck’s back. Bring her a tea or coffee and tell her about something she did recently that you really appreciated. When she’s negative, respond with more loving-kindness. Don’t do it in a kiss-ass way, but from a place of true compassion and sincerity. Try this for a few days and see if anything changes.”</p>
<p class="indentpara">Lisa agreed but sounded doubtful. A few days later, she sent me a text: “OMG, it totally worked! She asked me if I wanted to go to lunch! She even cracked a joke and has been so much nicer. Better!”</p>
<p class="justifypara1">Lisa’s shift shows that approaching every situation and every action from a place of love and nonjudgment not only creates positive change in our own lives, but in the lives of those around us. It’s an awesome ripple effect.</p>
<p class="indentpara">When you begin to shift to the default mind-set of love, the key is to literally embody love in every action and thought pattern. It may seem weird at first to see brushing your teeth or making yourself a sandwich as acts of love, but if you really think about them as things you’re doing to care for yourself, they absolutely are.</p>
<p class="indentpara">So when you’re doing simple, everyday things or having simple, everyday conversations, focus mindfully on the love and magic <span id="page_30">behind</span> them. Invite love into each and every space and intent. Notice the way you feel at your core after you’ve done this for even a short time; the change will amaze you.</p>
<p class="subhead1"><strong>Giving and Receiving Love</strong></p>
<p class="justifypara">For my entire life, until my own transformation and awakening, I’d focused on just a few kinds of love. Family love, romantic love, love between friends, love for the animals in my life, and maybe a bit of self-love mixed in now and then, although not nearly enough. What I didn’t know about at the time, and what I was totally missing out on, was the massive well of love that is available to all of us outside those parameters if we open ourselves to it and train our minds and hearts to remain open. The light, joy, and support available from that well of love truly never ends.</p>
<p class="indentpara">So how do we tap into the love outside the lines we’re conditioned to think within? <em>We expand our view of what defines love.</em></p>
<p class="indentpara">We look for and feel the love in everyday occurrences and actions and allow ourselves to fully experience it. We begin to see and fully embrace infinite love all around us, even in the smallest things.</p>
<p class="indentpara">For example, letting someone who’s clearly in a hurry go in front of you in line in the grocery store can be seen as not just an act of courtesy, but of love. It really is. People feel loved most when they feel seen, heard, and accepted.</p>
<p class="indentpara">You can feel loved when a stranger smiles at you or says hello and share love by doing this for others throughout your day. It’s not just for them; it’s for you. Small acts of love and vibrations of love surround us. If we let ourselves fully open to it and consciously experience it, we can actually bathe in it. How awesome is it to live from <em>that</em> place?</p>
<p class="indentpara">Recently, on a cool fall morning, I walked out into my garden for some fresh air and spotted a bright pink cosmos flower blooming. It was the middle of October, yet here was this beautiful bloom reminiscent of summer to greet me! How very cool! I walked over <span id="page_31">to</span> admire it and, of course, posted a picture to share with friends. Then I stood there and really took the time to marvel. Nature is truly filled with love, and there are signs of it everywhere. <em>Cosmos</em> is a Greek word meaning “balanced universe.” I chose to see this little cosmos bloom as a sign of love from the universe. A gift of love from the garden to which I give so much love and care. A reminder of that infinite well. My choice to see it that way made it so.</p>
<p class="indentpara">All things can be seen with love. Gratitude is a tremendous expression of love. Kindness is love. Nature is love. Small, everyday actions are love. Even rejection is love. (Think of it as the universe’s way of filtering out what’s not right for you.) And at our center, we are love.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Here’s a little exercise to help you start receiving, expanding, and giving <em>all</em> the love that is possible in your life. Try spending an entire day loving everything and everyone, without exception. Begin with loving your bed. Seriously! (That’s an easy one.) Love yourself. Love your family. Love the postal delivery person. <em>Love that person who is hard to love.</em> Love your body. Love the checkout guy at the grocery store. Love the bags he puts your groceries in. Love the barking dog that lives next door. This is not as easy as it sounds, but with practice, it will begin to flow naturally. Radiate love. . . be open to receiving love . . . consciously choose love in every moment. See how this profoundly shifts your energy. Then repeat this daily, over and over again, until it doesn’t seem like effort anymore. Until you feel an intense shift within—a love reprogramming!</p>
<p class="subhead1"><strong>Seeing the Love in Difficult Situations</strong></p>
<p class="justifypara">Some anger, resentment, and frustration can even be seen as love. This is huge, because when we’re able to do this, it changes everything. This was the hardest thing for me to wrap my head around, but when I began seeing the love beneath everything, including the seemingly negative, my heart ached with joy. As with Lisa’s story <span id="page_32">about</span> the woman in her office, looking for a love-based explanation in every situation is incredibly powerful and can shift outcomes in amazing ways.</p>
<p class="indentpara">This perspective changed so many of the stories I’d been repeatedly telling myself about past events in my life. People act out of their need for love, out of the love they feel, or out of fear, which ultimately is fear of not being loved. Once I fully understood this, I saw so many things from a totally new standpoint. I could see that many of the people I thought had hurt or abandoned me were actually acting in some way from a place of love.</p>
<p class="indentpara">I’ll share a personal story that’s a great example. During my senior year of high school, I fell wildly in love with a guy I’d worked with as a camp counselor over the previous summer at the local YMCA. To me he was everything. Our friendship, our connection, and the way my heart swelled with love when I looked at him or heard his voice—it was off the charts. It was my first great romantic love and, to this day, is one of the most significant loves of my life. We spent our senior year essentially growing up together, laughing with friends, spending late nights under the stars, and engaging in deep conversations about life and what we thought we wanted.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Then, just before graduation, he broke it off. I can still remember clearly the way my heart exploded in agony when he kissed me on the arm, a piece of his wavy hair falling into his eye and pain in his voice as he said goodbye and stepped out of my car. I was absolutely shattered. And at that young age, I had no idea what to do with that.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Every breath felt like needles in my chest when the graduation ceremony came and I walked down the stage in my cap and gown, feeling like my world was ending instead of just beginning. Yeah, I had a pretty lame graduation, to say the least.</p>
<p class="indentpara">It took several years before I no longer writhed over the loss. I didn’t understand how he could walk away when it seemed he loved me the same way I loved him. I was confused, my trust in life shaken, and everything I thought was real about love had been broken.</p>
<p class="indentpara"><span id="page_33">Although</span> we’d stayed in touch as friends on and off over the years, I went for more than twenty-three years without answers, always a little sting nagging at me whenever I’d remember those times. In the summer of 2012, a conversation with him over a friendly drink one night revealed a powerful, story-altering truth that I’d never considered before.</p>
<p class="indentpara">He didn’t leave me all those years ago because he didn’t love me. <em>He left because he did.</em></p>
<p class="indentpara">That night, we’d ended up out at a local pub after many years of not hanging out, mostly to catch up and talk about how life was going. It was special to both of us that we’d kept in touch for so long. After a couple of hours of laugher and cathartic conversation, I felt that the door had finally opened for me to ask the question that had lived in my heart for so long.</p>
<p class="indentpara">“So, can I ask you something?” I asked, allowing a wave of courage to swell inside me. “Were you ever in love with me?”</p>
<p class="indentpara">I knew he’d be honest. Why not at this point? It wouldn’t affect our friendship either way. I braced myself for “I thought I was, but . . . .” Instead it was an entirely different conversation.</p>
<p class="indentpara">“Of course I was!” he replied.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Surprised, a notable lump forming in my throat, I asked, “Then why did you leave?”</p>
<p class="indentpara">He tilted his head and looked at me, curiously, revealing a tiny ember of the light in his eyes that I’d fallen for all those years ago. “Don’t you know?” he asked.</p>
<p class="indentpara">“What?! No, I have no idea!”</p>
<p class="indentpara">“We were way too young for what we had. There was nowhere to go from there! What were we going to do, get married at seventeen? Hell no. We were stuck. There really wasn’t any other choice, as much as that sucked.”</p>
<p class="indentpara">Whoa! Stop the presses! I’d never thought of it that way. He was absolutely right. How wise he was, even at seventeen. I was floored. The pain I’d carried for all those years immediately dissolved. I felt a positive, physical shift within myself. If I’d just been willing to <span id="page_34">look</span> at things differently, <em>to see the possibility of love as the foundation of his actions in the first place</em>, it would have changed everything. This answer was so clear all along; I’d just never been willing to look closely enough. He wasn’t tossing me aside all those years ago . . . he was setting us both free.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Holy moly! Talk about a big shift and a brand-new version of the story! We’re still dear friends to this day.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Are there painful stories in your life where you might shift your view to see the love that was there all along? The true foundation of someone’s actions, even if you didn’t agree with them? A falling out with a friend or family member? A past heartbreak? Something you haven’t yet forgiven yourself for when you were really only acting in some way out of love? When you do this, you may surprise yourself with some of the realizations you’ll have.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Through this process, you will feel pain lift away, and that space in your heart where the pain used to live will be filled with peace and understanding. I don’t usually encourage digging up the past, but when it has something new to say (which isn’t often), it’s worth it! When you’re armed with a new perspective, sometimes launching an excavation to mine past experiences for new versions of the stories or alternative explanations can be life-changing. Once true clarity is reached, you can finally let go once and for all.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Permanently shifting your view to see the love beneath nearly all situations will also change the way you see and experience difficult situations that may arise in your future. It takes practice to regularly pause and deliberately look for the love, especially in very emotional scenarios. Sometimes, it takes willingness to look in the mirror to see your part. It can be like playing hide-and-seek. But with continued effort, you’ll begin to see through the lens of love, which will open incredible new doors, flood your world with light, and offer a magical new vista.</p>
<p class="subhead1"><strong>Love and Our Passions</strong></p>
<p class="justifypara">The summer I turned three, I planted a handful of watermelon seeds in my backyard sandbox to see if they would grow. Each <span id="page_35">morning</span> for several days, I ran out to water them with water I’d scoop out of the pool and to check for sprouts. I vividly recall the magical morning when the first sprout was waiting to greet me. The instant I spotted it, I was bubbling with excitement and wonder in complete and total awe of nature and life. To me, that little sprout literally sparkled.</p>
<p class="indentpara">That experience with the watermelon seeds was filed away with thousands of other life experiences, and although I didn’t know it at the time, it became part of who I am. In a way, the single moment when the seed sprouted in my sandbox became a seed itself. Thirty years later, I discovered I had a soulful passion for gardening. When I discovered this passion, the memory of how I felt as a child when that seed sprouted in my sandbox came flooding back, and it all made complete sense. It’s now become a beloved hobby that brings me tons of joy and childlike giddiness, and ties into my passions for organic living and growing my own food.</p>
<p class="indentpara"><em>The things we’re passionate about are an extension of love in our lives.</em> Seeing our passions as another form of giving and receiving love can magnify the purpose and joy they give us. This is also part of the reason why it’s so uplifting to listen to people talk enthusiastically about something they’re passionate about—it’s completely contagious. Pure love. I could listen all day to someone talking about watching paint dry if it was infused with infectious, ridiculously zealous passion and joy.</p>
<p class="indentpara">One of the things I hear most when coaching clients or speaking to groups is that they feel like they lack passion in their lives. At times I’ve felt that way, too, so I completely relate. It’s heartbreaking to think that some people live that way for very long periods, even years. But it’s never too late to bring back the zing.</p>
<p class="indentpara">One of my first suggestions for cultivating more passion is to create a list of early childhood memories that filled you with joy and wonder, like my memories of the watermelon seeds. See if you can link those experiences to anything present in your life now or anything you’ve been desiring to invite into your life. You might find a few surprises. The links don’t have to be too literal. Maybe <span id="page_36">you</span> loved playing house when you were young and now you long to work in interior design.</p>
<p class="indentpara">We discover many of our true passions and innate gifts when we’re kids but lose our connection to so many of them as we get older. Sometimes, the things you’re really passionate about are already a part of your life; they just need to be recognized and nurtured to start really burning. They’re present as sparks that will allow you to build intense fires when you’re ready.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Passion doesn’t have to link to just one or two big pursuits in your life. It can be infused into nearly everything if you consciously allow it to be, just like love. They go hand in hand. You can find passion in the artistic way you make your coffee in the morning, if you look.</p>
<p class="indentpara">A simple way to start enjoying more passionate energy is to slow down just a bit to mindfully focus much more on the pleasures of everyday sensory experiences. When sipping a glass of wine or a great tea, or taking a bite of food, allow yourself to be fully present to the taste, feel, and sensation. Feel the gratitude in your heart for that single taste or bite. This practice can turn even tea and a scone into a five-star dining experience.</p>
<p class="indentpara">If you’re viewing a beautiful work of art or just putting on a favorite coat, really marvel at the details of these small miracles. Notice the brushstrokes or the stitching. Vocalize your feelings more often to create full presence and to share that energy with those around you. Isn’t it delicious when you hear someone say something passionately, like “Oh, wow! This is <em>the</em> most incredible cheese I’ve tasted in forever! Have you tried it?” Makes you want to race to take a bite, doesn’t it?</p>
<p class="indentpara">Try this sensory adventure for thirty days and see how it elevates the passion, pleasure, and love energy in your life.

It will also help you discover some of the larger passions that could lead you down amazing new roads.</p>
<p class="subhead1"><strong>Romantic Love</strong></p>
<p class="justifypara">I wish I’d learned much earlier that authentic, delectable romance can be found in many, many places. Not just with a significant other. Merriam-Webster currently defines romance as “an emotional attraction or aura belonging to an especially heroic era, adventure, or activity.” Oxford says romance is “a quality or feeling of mystery, excitement, and remoteness from everyday life.” (No wonder I have an immediate mad crush on every boat I lay eyes on!) How cool is that? We can tap into an endless number of things to evoke those feelings and experiences.</p>
<p class="indentpara">The previous section on passion is a great example: Romance can be nearly everywhere you look, if you choose to see it. Our natural longing for romance can be satisfied regularly if we seek the romance in everyday pleasures and in <em>all</em> our relationships.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Romance can be found and enjoyed in relationships with friends and family members. It can be shared with people with whom we have a common passion—even with coworkers. It can be experienced sitting under a tree alone enjoying an afternoon breeze, or on a solo date night with candles, a great meal, and the TV remote. It’s present in everything we love to do.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Shifting our view to see the romance available from so many sources (just like the love that’s available from so many sources) will help fill that part of our spirits that longs for those feelings. And in a relationship with a significant other, tapping into romance, love, and passion from other sources can help keep sparks present as well. That energy, when truly embraced, can’t help but spill into and elevate all areas of life.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Now, in the area of relationships with romantic partners, I can honestly tell you that, like many, I’ve had to learn huge lessons by <span id="page_38">screwing</span> up, falling on my face a few times, experiencing enormous heartbreak, and, in spite of it all, working to keep the faith.</p>
<p class="indentpara">A loving, soulful relationship with a significant other can be an amazing gift and can certainly add to our happiness—“add to” being the key idea to consider. One of the biggest mistakes I’ve made in past relationships, and I know many can relate to this, is allowing my own happiness to depend on the actions and approval of the other person. This is backward and ultimately unfair to the person on whom we’re placing that responsibility—that’s a lot of pressure!</p>
<p class="indentpara">The truth is, the way we can show up as our very best and offer the greatest amount of love and support to our partner is to take complete responsibility for our own happiness, from A to Z. The purpose of a love relationship is not to fill a void, to complete us, or even to be part of the foundation for our happiness. Its purpose is to help us grow emotionally and spiritually and to enhance an already full, happy life. This is a key standpoint from which joyful, lasting relationships survive, thrive, and grow.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Growing your happiness is virtually guaranteed to significantly improve your love life as well. So I’m going to share with you a few of the profound lessons I’ve learned that may greatly support you in cultivating a loving, soulful partnership. They apply not only to relationships with significant others but also to our passions, careers, and relationships with ourselves and those we love. These are things I now know for sure and would have loved to know when I was much younger. (It would have saved me a whole lot of grief!) They’re ideas I consider exceptionally important in any happiness toolbox, as well as excellent bricks in a happiness foundation.</p>
<p class="indentpara"><strong>Staying in love is a choice.</strong> Falling in love is magical, amazingly significant, and a bit of a mystery, all in one beautiful package. We all know those couples who have been together for many years and still seem to be in love. You’ll often hear people commenting on how wonderful it is or asking how they do it. The answer is <em>they choose it and then act on it</em>. Over and over again. Waking up each morning and choosing great love is part of what makes it so.</p>
<p class="justifypara1"><span id="page_39">Choosing</span> to be in love involves consciously remembering why you first fell in love with your partner, purposefully focusing on the things you love about them (instead of little, insignificant faults), and deliberately tapping into the immense gratitude and happiness you feel because your partner is part of your world. This person is choosing to love you and walk the path with you, so allow yourself to be amazed and honored by this . . . every single day. Doing this empowers light, love, affection, and chemistry. Falling in love is beautiful magic; staying in love is a choice. And like so many incredible things in life, it requires action. Choose love every day.</p>
<p class="indentpara"><strong>Loving someone means supporting that person’s freedom.</strong> When we love someone, we like to think we know what’s best for him or her. Sometimes we do. We also like to think they should make important choices while considering how it will affect our relationship. True, to a point. While it’s great to share our insights, advice, and guidance with our partner out of love, we also have to allow the space for the one we love to make decisions based on what’s calling their soul, and we have to support their choices—even when they’re not our choices. Love does not try to control. Zen Buddhist monk, spiritual teacher, and author Thich Nhat Hanh says this beautifully: “You must love in such a way that the person you love feels free.” Yes. And we must also be loved in such a way that we feel free.</p>
<p class="indentpara"><strong>The key to longevity in relationships is <em>acceptance</em>.</strong> When I was twenty-five, I was working as an assistant on a cable TV show about healthy lifestyles. I was in the green room one morning stuffing my face with a spring roll meant for the day’s expert guest, sure he wouldn’t miss one. As I finished chewing, a man walked in who had a beautiful, magnetic energy. I quickly swallowed and smiled at him.</p>
<p class="indentpara"><span id="page_40">I</span> had no clue at the time who this man was or what he was all about, but I knew immediately that I wanted to listen to everything he had to say. His name was Deepak Chopra. He said good morning and I welcomed him, explaining a few logistics about what to expect on the set. He was warm and kind and seemed completely at ease. I had no idea at the time the huge impact his teachings would have on my life. You know those times when you look back and think, “<em>Damn! Wish I’d known!</em>”? That was one of those times for sure. He put his things down and began to settle in. “Do you need anything else?” I asked.</p>
<p class="indentpara">“No, I’m fine, thank you,” he answered. Then he offered me a spring roll.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Fifteen years later, I was at a talk in downtown Los Angeles that Dr. Chopra gave to a group of women entrepreneurs about prosperity and success. Many great questions were asked that day about business and abundance. But one question asked of him was completely off topic, and I think the answer changed everyone in the room. A woman stood up and asked, “You have a long and loving relationship with your wife. What would you say is the secret to a lasting, happy relationship?” You could feel the energy shift as everyone leaned forward to hear his response.</p>
<p class="indentpara">There was a short pause as he thoughtfully decided on his answer. We expected to hear that the secret was love, communication, or patience. All very important, of course. But his profound and unexpected answer was a major <em>of course!</em> moment.</p>
<p class="indentpara">“Acceptance. Total acceptance.”</p>
<p class="indentpara">The room was silent for a few moments, except for a few soft gasps and a couple of audible wows. Before I even knew what I made of it, I felt tears welling up in my eyes. In that moment, I realized that this vital ingredient had been missing from just about every relationship I’d ever been in, including my marriage. Holy crap.</p>
<p class="indentpara">This lesson permanently shifted the way I show up in every relationship in my life, including those with family and friends—even in my relationship with myself.</p>
<p class="indentpara"><span id="page_41">Complete</span> and total acceptance! Absolutely! The most underrated element in any loving, lasting relationship. We all grow and change over the years. Our dreams change, our bodies change, our opinions change. When we love someone and choose to make a life with that person, we must be willing to accept him or her just as they are. Without judgment. We must continue choosing to fully accept them every single day, just as we choose to be in love with them every day, and <em>just as we deeply desire to be fully accepted ourselves</em>. We must be open to growing together, or risk growing apart.</p>
<p class="indentpara">We have to be willing to love someone, flaws and all; love them through their mistakes, in spite of their habits that don’t match ours; and learn to embrace imperfections as part of the total package of the person we love.</p>
<p class="indentpara">This doesn’t mean it’s not okay to give your partner loving encouragement and support to grow and make improvements. It means doing this while at the same time fully loving, supporting, and <em>accepting</em> that person exactly as they choose to be, and just where they are. Offering each other the gift of complete acceptance is a beautiful foundation for a loving relationship. It’s never too late to begin fully and unconditionally accepting your partner, yourself, and all those who matter in your life. This is a tremendous and incredibly freeing act of love.</p>
<p class="indentpara"><strong>What’s missing is what you’re not giving.</strong> Oh, yeah! Personal responsibility! Ugh, it can be so uncomfortable. It’s a tough one, but owning our own junk can bring astonishing awareness to our relationships and our lives, as well as positive change and clear answers. It’s hugely empowering if you’re willing to go there.</p>
<p class="indentpara">I learned this a while back in my studies of the metaphysical text <em>A Course in Miracles</em>. The course teaches that <em>only what you have not given can be lacking in any situation.</em> This is a monumentally powerful truth.</p>
<p class="indentpara">When I first heard this idea, I was like, “Whoa! What <em>I’m</em> not giving? I’m not sure about that one!” But the more I dove in and reflected on the deep meaning of this idea, and the more I opened <span id="page_42">myself</span> to looking at what more I might be able to offer in different situations, the more I realized that what’s missing in any situation is <em>always,</em> in some way, what I’m not giving.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Here’s a tough but super-empowering statement if you’re willing to embrace it: <em>Ongoing emotional suffering is our own doing.</em> It’s never the responsibility of anyone else. The actions of others may contribute to our initial hurt, but choosing to continue to suffer and then blaming others for that ongoing suffering is just a way of evading responsibility for what we’ve created and allowed.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Now, sometimes, there’s a very valid reason for ongoing emotional suffering, such as the loss of a loved one or another traumatic life event. In these cases, it’s important to give yourself a loving amount of space and a reasonable amount of time to grieve. But I can honestly say that this, too, is an area where we must take responsibility at some point and be willing to move forward, heal, and rebuild. You may feel like life will never be the same after a great loss, and you’re right. It will be different. But know that this doesn’t mean it can’t be full of happiness, love, and light again. You are deserving of this.</p>
<p class="indentpara">What’s wonderful and so powerful about this is that when we fully understand its absolute truth, we know we always have the power to take action to move toward dissolving and releasing our suffering anytime we choose. We are in complete control. And the way to begin doing this is by giving more, loving more, and forgiving all. Taking personal responsibility is a tremendous act of courage.</p>
<p class="indentpara">If you’ve ever felt that “I’ve lost myself” or “I can’t be myself anymore” in a love relationship, believe me, you’re not alone. So many of us have been there—I know I have—and it can be a painful, damaging place, especially when we blame the other person (which happens all too often). You wouldn’t blame your partner if you lost your keys, right? So why do we tend to blame others when we lose ourselves?</p>
<p class="indentpara">The truth is, only we are responsible for our own happiness, well-being, and emotional fitness. It’s a huge mistake to put the key to your own happiness on someone else’s keychain, not to mention <span id="page_43">totally</span> unfair to that person. If you ever feel like you’ve lost touch with yourself, like you can’t be yourself, or like “something’s missing” in a relationship, begin working through it by asking what more you can give. Own your part. Take your power back. Dig deep. Really examine this, and the answers will surprise you.</p>
<p class="indentpara">This is not to say that every relationship has the potential to be healthy or right. What every relationship <em>is,</em> however, is an opportunity to learn and grow. In toxic or abusive situations, or when your inner voice is telling you this is not the partner for you, the part that is lacking may be acknowledgment of the fact that the relationship needs to come to an end. Therefore, the “<em>What more can I give?</em>” becomes the act of letting go. Walking away becomes an act of love, as does forgiving and viewing the other person with compassion.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Whatever you’re looking for, begin by giving more. If you want more love, be more loving. If you want more understanding, be more understanding. If you want more affection, be more affectionate. Gush! And when it comes to intimacy, take action to get your sexy on! Act <em>as if</em> the fire is there, and the desire will appear. Give, give, give, and watch the sparks fly!</p>
<p class="subhead1"><strong>Self-Love</strong></p>
<p class="justifypara">Last spring, I visited Paris for the first time. Oh, I could write another whole book on my passionate love affair with that delicious city! I felt drenched in beauty and love every moment I was there.</p>
<p class="indentpara">One delightfully rainy afternoon, I was sitting in a café sipping white wine and watching incredibly interesting people walk by. A ruggedly sexy French guy who was sitting behind me struck up a conversation.</p>
<p class="indentpara">“How long are you here for?” he asked in a scrumptious, raspy voice with an accent that could melt steel.</p>
<p class="indentpara">“Only a couple more days, but I’m really wishing it was longer!” I answered smiling, momentarily euphoric that he spoke to me.</p>
<p class="indentpara">“You have a very special vibration about you,” he said. “What do you do?”</p>
<p class="indentpara">Wow. A small reminder once again that energy is everything. <span id="page_44">Something</span> about his authentic, inquisitive tone told me he wasn’t really flirting; he was looking for some company and interesting conversation. Truly. When I looked at his face again, I detected an underlying layer of genuine curiosity and sensed he’d been through many struggles in his days.</p>
<p class="indentpara">“I’m a life coach, writer, and speaker. I study and write about happiness.”</p>
<p class="indentpara">He paused thoughtfully for a few seconds. “Ahhh, life coach. You help people make a better life? To be happier?”</p>
<p class="indentpara">“Exactly!” I said with a laugh, pleased that he got it. “I love it, and I’m always learning myself.”</p>
<p class="indentpara">“We have life coaches here in France. But here I believe we call them seek analysts.”</p>
<p class="indentpara">Seek analyst! I loved it! I wasn’t entirely sure if that was accurate, <span id="page_46">but</span> I was amused by the idea of the translation, and it certainly worked. Helping people to analyze, discover, and fulfill what they’re seeking. I’ll take it!</p>
<p class="indentpara">He thoughtfully sipped his Cabernet and then set his glass on the table deliberately. “You really have to love yourself to do that kind of work, no?”</p>
<p class="indentpara"><em>This guy so gets it,</em> I thought. I smiled and immediately answered, “Ohhhh, yeah. I spent the first thirty-two years of my life learning how to love myself, and the last ten helping others to do the same. It’s a daily practice.”</p>
<p class="indentpara">“Thirty-two years?” he said. “That’s a lot of study!” We laughed in unison.</p>
<p class="indentpara">I swear, sometimes the best conversations happen with perfect strangers in random places. After a few more minutes of laughter and small talk, I bid au revoir to the hot Frenchman and spent much of the rest of that day thinking about self-love and how the lack of it in our world just might be our most underrated epidemic.</p>
<p class="indentpara">I believe we are born naturally loving ourselves. Then a panoply of various circumstances and experiences compound over the years, providing fertile ground for our egos to collaborate with those past mistakes and unfavorable experiences to condition us otherwise. It’s our job to keep our egos in check and teach them how to use the wisdom gained from past experiences for our own benefit rather than twisting it into (invalid) reasons for beating ourselves up.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Ever see a toddler go through the stage where they discover the meaning and power of the word <em>no</em>? For parents, this can be frustrating, annoying, and hilarious all at the same time. But we shouldn’t be so quick to squash this behavior. Some call this the terrible twos, but is it really so terrible to learn to passionately state what you don’t want and to set boundaries based on pure desire, self-love, and self-assertion? Personally, I think we should all use the word <em>no</em> much more often and, at the same time, look to reconnect with the innate self-love and self-worth we naturally had as babies.</p>
<p class="indentpara">When we learn to make truly loving ourselves an integral part of our lives, we live in a way that naturally attracts amazing things. <span id="page_47">This</span> way of being shines light on the goodness we deserve and naturally red flags us on situations to avoid.</p>
<p class="indentpara">I can trace so many of the detrimental situations I got myself into when I was younger to a lack of self-love. I’d even blamed others in those scenarios for my own distress, when I was the one truly responsible.</p>
<p class="indentpara">What we tolerate in our lives is a direct reflection of the love we have for ourselves. What’s awesome about this is that when we truly start loving ourselves, embracing our worth, and treating ourselves like we are our own best friend, we naturally tolerate much less BS with ease!</p>
<p class="indentpara">In one past relationship with a man I shared a home with, he forbade me to park in the garage because I’d accidentally left it open a handful of times when we’d first moved in. One sunny, peaceful afternoon, I came home from running errands and was literally locked out of my own garage. Instead of expressing my feelings and demanding that my side of the garage be unlocked immediately, I allowed it to continue—for two years.</p>
<p class="indentpara">While I totally understood his initial frustration, his reaction and handling of the situation was extreme and demeaning. He would come down hard on me anytime I would push to park in the safety of the garage instead of on the dark street at night. He would threaten to leave me if I “insisted” on parking in the garage. My garage. So I let it go on. Out of fear. Out of wanting to avoid confrontation. Out of shame. Eventually, the relationship unraveled anyway.</p>
<p class="indentpara">When I think about that time in my life, my heart hurts for the woman I was then. I want to tell her so many things. I want to put my arms around her and pull her to safety from herself. And, holy bananas, do I want her to read this book! Here is what I would say to her if I could.</p>
<p class="indentpara"><em>Oh, dear one. I love you so. You are so amazing. You are worthy of your love and of all the love in the universe, and it’s more than you can imagine. You are a precious treasure, a divine creation, and deserve to be treated as such. Walk away from anyone who sees you as anything less than the beautiful, incredible miracle <span id="page_48">that</span> you are. There are wonderful doors open and waiting, darling (including garage doors!). Doors to freedom, joy, unconditional love, acceptance, and abundant miracles! Walk through them; they were created just for you. Be bold and embrace your greatness. Your most incredible life is waiting, and you are infinitely loved.</em></p>
<p class="indentpara">Self-love is not easy for everyone. In fact, like so much of what I talk about in this book, it’s truly a daily practice—one to be infused in everything you do. For some, the first step to great self-love is just being willing. You may already feel like you love yourself (awesome!), but there is always room for more, trust me. Being willing and open to unconditionally and <em>actively</em> love yourself is in itself a great act of self-love. Forgiveness is often the next step, which we’re going to talk about shortly.</p>
<p class="indentpara1">Finally, I’ll wrap up this bit on self-love by encouraging you to love more all around. Across the board. Love all people and all things, even the ones that are hard to love. The more love you give, the more you become love, and the more massive, unlimited love you’ll feel for yourself. You are a precious being worthy and deserving of the gift of your beautiful love. Every single day.</p>
<div class="C563">
<p class="subhead2">Three Steps to Self-love</p>
<p class="leftpara">Consider these three steps to begin expanding your love for your incredible self.</p>
<p class="hanging"><span class="C561"><strong>1.</strong></span><strong>Treat your body, mind, and spirit like they belong to someone you love deeply.</strong> Have you ever heard the saying that if we treated our friends the way we treat ourselves, we wouldn’t have any friends? Kind of funny, I know—but also eye-opening. Treat yourself with love, kindness, and compassion like you are your very best friend in the world—like you are the <em>hero</em> of your life. <em>Because you are.</em></p>
<p class="hanging2"><span class="C561"><strong>2.</strong></span><strong>Start consciously seeing even the smallest acts of self-care as acts of self-love.</strong> The more you link taking care of yourself and doing things you enjoy to loving yourself, the more you’ll see that love grow, and the more you’ll find it showing up. Whenever you do what you love to do or take good care of yourself, make a habit of tuning in to feel in your bones how much you deserve this loving treatment. Allow those feelings to grow and be present within you.</p>
<p class="indentpara2">Here’s another thing that goes along with this. Begin to see saying yes to what <em>others</em> offer to do for you as an act of self-love. So often we tend to be overly self-sufficient, saying “Thanks, I’m good” when people offer to help us out. We women tend to do this most, especially with the men in our lives. Begin to catch yourself turning down offers of help and then reprogram your mind to say, “Yes! Thank you! (<em>Because I love myself and I deserve <span id="page_45">help.</span></em>)” You’ll not only feel less frazzled and overwhelmed, you’ll also begin to feel more loved—by yourself and others. Receive. It’s awesome!</p>
<p class="hanging2"><span class="C413"><strong>3.</strong></span><strong>Know what a magnificent miracle you are.</strong> Truly! One of the things that will really crack open your heart to loving yourself fully is to really take the time to ponder what an incredible, amazing miracle you are (we all are). Did you know you are literally made of stardust? Our bodies (and about everything else on earth) are made up of certain elements (carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, etc.), and most of the elements on earth originated from within the center of a star. How amazing is that when you really think about it? We are connected with all things—physically and energetically part of the vastness of the universe.</p>
<p class="indentpara3">Our bodies are vehicles for our souls. Just like our bodies, our souls are who we truly are, and they are beautiful miracles here to learn, grow, and serve. You are a soul, residing within an incredible vessel, here to live the human experience.</p>
<p class="indentpara4">Everything you’ve gone through, every victory and every mistake, is part of that experience and was there to guide you in your journey and to your purpose. We are all one with all things. Each of us deserves infinite love, and part of our purpose is to receive this love. We can honor our Source (or higher power) and this life we’ve been gifted by embracing that purpose through truly loving ourselves.</p>
</div>
<p class="subhead"><strong>HAPPINESS MIND-SET #2: FORGIVENESS</strong></p>
<p class="justifypara">Forgiveness, when correctly embraced and understood, is monumentally powerful and life changing. There are so many misconceptions about what forgiveness is and what it’s not. Becoming clear on what forgiveness actually is and how it can free your spirit to soar is the key.</p>
<p class="indentpara">To get started chatting about what forgiveness is, let’s start with what it’s not. This is stuff that took me a long time to get, but when I did, it changed my life.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Forgiveness is not approval of what the other person did. It doesn’t always mean that in some way you agree with or are okay with what went down. And forgiving someone does not automatically mean you must continue to have that person in your immediate <span id="page_49">circle—</span>or in your life at all. You can completely forgive people and still choose not to have them in your life, temporarily or permanently. Most important, although forgiveness can benefit the other person both energetically and emotionally, it is not for them. <em>It’s for you.</em></p>
<p class="justifypara1">Here are a few questions to consider that will help you wrap your heart around these ideas.</p>
<p class="hanging4"><span class="C561">•</span><strong><em>How much of your precious energy are you putting into</em> not <em>forgiving someone?</em></strong> Are there higher-quality places in which you could be spending that energy that would improve your life rather than drain it?</p>
<p class="hanging4"><span class="C561">•</span><strong><em>Would you like to be free of negative energy?</em></strong> Unforgiveness is a form of negative energy. If you are looking to free yourself of—or carry less—negative energy (required in mastering the skill of happiness), you must forgive all and make room for higher vibes. It’s also heavy baggage you have to carry around. When you forgive everything, it’s like packing light for life.</p>
<p class="hanging4"><span class="C561">•</span><strong><em>Can you look deeper to see that what the other person did was based on either love or fear?</em></strong> If you can’t see it, look deeper. It’s there in some form. Seeing this will put you in touch with the human side of that person—the side that sometimes makes bad decisions or mistakes—which will make it much easier to forgive.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Now let’s talk for a couple of minutes about what forgiveness really <em>is</em>. Forgiveness is a sign of great strength. It takes tremendous courage, resolve, and a giving heart. Forgiveness is a great act of self-love.</p>
<p class="indentpara"><span id="page_50">In</span> order to forgive, you must give. The word <em>give</em> is the very heart of the word for<em>give</em>ness. It does take energy, and it’s not always instant. Even the most naturally forgiving people sometimes need time to process the big stuff before they can completely forgive, so it’s totally okay to take your time. Just not too much time. Don’t rush yourself, but don’t let the issue fester either. Forgiveness and resentment cannot live in the same space.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Consciously make the choice to forgive. Address it and work through it, and you’ll feel a shift when you’re ready to forgive and let go. Do this regularly with the big stuff and the little stuff, too. All of it. Include the practice of forgiving yourself (yes, you) for anything and everything. You’re worthy of this, just like you’re worthy of your love.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Free yourself through forgiveness. Let go of all that heaviness and let the light in. Learn to accept apologies you will never receive (that one was huge for me). One step in doing this is to understand that whatever happened wasn’t personal, even if the other person is still stuck in a place of making it personal. It’s also helpful to allow the other person to be exactly where he or she is, while choosing to believe in your heart that, with an expanded perspective, some part of him or her would understand the hurt they contributed.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Become a natural forgiver by adopting forgiveness as an instinctive mind-set and a go-to choice when things get messed up. Forgive those you feel have wronged you and wish them healing and love.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Forgiveness is the master key that unlocks a great many of the invisible shackles we’ve put on ourselves.</p>
<p class="subhead"><strong>HAPPINESS MIND-SET #3: COMPASSION</strong></p>
<p class="justifypara">This is such a big one. Compassion is the basis for so much love, kindness, and beauty in the world—and it’s certainly a big part of the foundation for forgiveness.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Most of us have a good amount of compassion for others, but what I’d like to say here is that we can all adopt an entirely new <span id="page_51">level</span> of compassion that is life changing. In fact, if everyone took steps to practice and grow the mind-set of compassion, it would absolutely change the world.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Growing up and all through my twenties, I was compassionate toward others, toward animals always, and even toward fictional characters that experienced epic struggles. But I was not nearly compassionate enough toward those I disagreed with or was in conflict with, which is where compassion is especially powerful. Having compassion for those we don’t fully agree with or those we feel have wronged us (or others) in some way brings a new dynamic of love and understanding to any situation. Compassion is light in the darkness, and it fuels change.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Self-compassion was totally absent from my life until my early thirties. When I woke up to the power of self-compassion and realized how hard I’d been on myself for so long, how unforgiving I’d been toward my own sensitive heart, I was immediately driven to create a big change.</p>
<p class="indentpara">I started by looking back at times when I deserved my own compassion, when I deserved to cut myself a break, and sent love, forgiveness, and understanding to my past self, which allowed me to consciously let go of all that heaviness. It was mind-blowing to me how much lighter I felt when I made this shift.</p>
<p class="indentpara">When we understand that we’re all doing the best we can with the information, knowledge, and resources we have in each moment, we can find compassion. When we consciously recognize that every single person we meet has his or her own unique struggles, pain, and challenges, we can forgo judgment and view things from a place of understanding, kindness, and empathy.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Compassion, like the other happiness mind-sets in this chapter, is a practice. You don’t have to rehash the past to begin living from a place of compassion. Think about people and situations in your life now—people you may have judged, who rub you the wrong way, or toward whom you feel some kind of negative energy. Examine those relationships with a new understanding. Can you <span id="page_52">acknowledge</span> that we are all connected? That we’re all doing the best we can with the knowledge we have? That none of us is perfect, and that’s a beautiful thing? See those people who come to mind as miracles and as teachers. Everyone who is living in this lifetime with us has something to teach us. That’s an amazing gift if we’re willing to receive it, and the way to begin is through compassion.</p>
<p class="indentpara">A simple quote from the Dalai Lama sums up why the practice and mind-set of compassion is so monumentally important: “If you want others to be happy, practice compassion. If you want to be happy, practice compassion.”</p>
<p class="indentpara">That pretty much says it all. Whenever you feel yourself reacting toward someone (or yourself) out of anger, frustration, or judgment, work to catch it and see if you can mindfully open your heart and view the situation from a place of compassion before you react further or do any analyzing. With continued effort and practice, this will become natural for you—an amazing new habit—and it will change the way you experience your entire life.</p>
<p class="subhead"><strong>HAPPINESS MIND-SET #4: KINDNESS</strong></p>
<p class="justifypara">Be kind. Surround yourself with truly kind people. It sounds elementary, but I want to emphasize that the energy of kindness is vital to your happiness.</p>
<p class="indentpara">We probably all know a few good, well-meaning people who are not inherently kind. These are people to keep at arm’s length. Authentic kindness comes from the soul—from a place of compassion, thoughtfulness, selflessness, and pure love. Seek out people who are innately kind and invite them into your divine circle.</p>
<p class="indentpara">The energy created from giving or receiving genuine loving-kindness not only instantly elevates happiness, it’s also good for your health. Science has shown that regular exposure to kindness—both giving and receiving—can actually add years to your life! Not surprising, right?</p>
<p class="indentpara"><span id="page_53">You</span> know those days when you’re just feeling extra kind and super-positive for whatever reason? Spreading random acts of kindness and light, going out of your way to help people or compliment them, and receiving A-game energy in return? Aren’t those great days? Imagine what your world would be like if you deliberately created many more of those days or even lived within that vibe a majority of the time. An awesome thought, right? With conscious effort, you can! Imagine what the world would be like if more people were aligned with that mission.</p>
<p class="indentpara">One of the highest levels of positive energy you can cultivate is when you deliberately make the stressed checkout person at the grocery store laugh, compliment a stranger on something you know they worked hard for (a new car, a lovely outfit, a snazzy hairstyle), go out of your way to help someone when they need it, or even just smile electrically at all those in your path. You receive the benefits, and so does everyone around you.</p>
<p class="indentpara">I’m tall, so one of my favorite things to do when I’m out and about is help people reach objects that are high up on shelves at stores. Seriously, it lights me up like I popped a magic pill. Find small ways you can be of service to others or spread good feelings when you’re going about your regular days, and work at doing them until they become habit. This is a great way to increase the kindness energy in your life.</p>
<p class="indentpara">At the same time you’re looking to step up the kindness factor, look for ways you can dial back on unkindness toward others. None of us wants to admit it, but nearly all of us have sides that we’re not so proud of, especially when we feel stressed or our patience is tested. You can be a naturally kind person down to your core and still have a couple of touchy areas that could be improved upon.</p>
<p class="indentpara">When I feel mistreated in some way by a company or service, I have a tendency to direct some of my frustration at customer service people (I know I’m not alone in this). Rotten customer service is a pet peeve of mine, but the customer service reps rarely, if ever, have anything to do with it. I’ve really been working to be more <span id="page_54">mindful</span> of this, primarily through tapping into compassion for the overworked reps, and have made significant improvement. Now, I find myself many times joking around with them and telling them their efforts are appreciated—even in the most ridiculous of customer service failures. Much better energy for all.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Be ready to make regular efforts to surround yourself with kind people. It’s a permanent work in progress. It takes mindful maintenance of boundaries and willingness to distance yourself from some people who are out of alignment. And when you meet people who radiate kindness, open your heart to learning from them. After all, kindness creates more kindness.</p>
<p class="indentpara">A few years ago on a business trip to New York City, I received a powerful lesson on the energy of kindness from a stranger in an elevator. I’d just checked into my hotel, which was very old, dark, and had a haunted feel. I wasn’t thrilled with it, but it was affordable. I clumsily stumbled into the rickety, tiny elevator, lugging all my baggage, and found myself uncomfortably close to a very tall, scruffy-looking man. Hello, awkward moment.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Elevator rides with strangers always seem to be a little weird. You’re not sure who’s going to push the button, if you should start small talk, or if you should talk at all. I was a little intimidated by this random guy I was squashed next to that afternoon. I’d had a rough day, was worn out from travel, and this dude was huge and looked a bit like he’d just stepped out of a zombie apocalypse movie.</p>
<p class="indentpara">After a long, silent ride up dozens of floors, we reached his stop, and I pulled my wheelie bag out of the way so he could exit. As I did this, a sudden urge to speak to him came to me out of nowhere. “Have a nice day,” I blurted out. A well-meaning but mundane statement.</p>
<p class="indentpara">When he stepped out and heard me say those words, he paused, turned toward me, and smiled one of the brightest smiles I’d ever seen. As the elevator doors began to close, he replied, “Have many.”</p>
<p class="indentpara">Have many! Many nice days? Yes, please! I will, thanks! His kind response not only made my week, it taught me not to be so <span id="page_55">quick</span> to be intimidated by people and to always lean toward connection. To let people know I <em>see</em> them. A beautiful lesson I received that day from a beautiful man. It was a moment in time I’ll never forget.</p>
<p class="subhead1"><strong>The Circle of Kindness Exercise</strong></p>
<p class="justifypara">An easy way to start focusing on spending more time with inherently kind people is to take a piece of paper and write down the names of the people in your life—friends, colleagues, neighbors, family, etc. Include all the people you see on a regular or semiregular basis. Make it a fairly large list. Add people you enjoy being around or would like to see more often, even if you don’t know them really well. Then go through the list and circle the ones who are kind and positive and make you feel energized. These are the relationships to focus on growing. It’s an eye-opening exercise. Do this on a semiregular basis and it will help you to balance this part of your happiness foundation, as well as make more empowering choices about with whom you spend time.</p>
<p class="indentpara">A while back, I was sitting in the waiting room in the spa at my gym. Several women were in the room with me, including a lovely ninety-four-year-old who glowed with positive energy. A woman who was sitting next to me asked the older one what her secret was for looking and feeling so great at her age. Her answer? “I’ve always surrounded myself with nice people. That’s the secret.” Exactly.</p>
<p class="subhead"><strong>HAPPINESS MIND-SET #5: ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE</strong></p>
<p class="justifypara">Anything is possible! Yes, anything. It sounds like a simple statement, and it is. But it doesn’t do nearly as much as a statement as it does as a <em>mind-set.</em> When you dig deep, you might be shocked to discover the hidden limiting beliefs that are holding you back and lowering the vibes of your life. The anything-is-possible mind-set, when it becomes part of your being, can zap many of those limiting beliefs before they fester and prevent them from warping your groove.</p>
<p class="indentpara"><span id="page_56">When</span> I was around nineteen, I experienced my very first Cirque du Soleil show. At the time, I thought it was kind of “meh.” I remember thinking it was lovely but not really my cup of tea. I just wasn’t that moved by it, and I didn’t understand all the hype.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Then about four years ago, I went to my first Cirque du Soleil show in twenty years. Remembering my first experience, I wasn’t expecting to be tremendously inspired. In fact, I’d expected to be a little bored. I was totally wrong; I was completely astonished by it! The ridiculously talented performers and the amazing, graceful, seemingly impossible things they were able to do blew me away. It really was incredible, and for the first time, I understood why they get so much well-deserved acclaim.</p>
<p class="indentpara">In the days after seeing that show, I couldn’t shake my curiosity about the contrast between the first time I’d seen the performance and this time. Why was I so uninspired the first time and completely amazed by it all these years later? Then the answer came, and it made absolute sense. I wasn’t that awed by it the first time because as a very young woman, I didn’t have nearly the collection of limiting beliefs that I have now! So nothing they were doing then seemed all that impossible or unbelievable to me at the time. However, this last time, I had twenty extra years’ worth of limiting beliefs about things not being possible or being hard to do, and it made everything they were doing seem absolutely incredible. My brain was primed to have some of those negative, limiting beliefs totally challenged!</p>
<p class="indentpara">After this realization, I wanted to shift to an anything-is-possible way of thinking so I could begin to see my life and the world the way I saw that first Cirque du Soleil show. Like anything is 100 percent possible, especially if we’re willing to be surprised! It made no sense to go into anything else thinking there was a 30, 50, or 70 percent chance of making it work, which is exactly how I’d been operating—always with some doubt present to suck energy from the effort.</p>
<p class="indentpara">I wanted to start approaching life believing that there’s a 100 percent chance things can go my way every time. Not that they always <span id="page_57">will,</span> but <em>believing</em> it’s always possible—and <em>probable</em>—is key not only to raising the vibration of every situation but also to creating a more positive experience overall, no matter the outcome. An absolute YES attitude. Plus, it’s a pretty fun way to go about your days, truly believing anything is possible and allowing yourself to just be in awe of the universe and its miracles coming your way all the time.</p>
<p class="indentpara">For inspiration, I looked for people I admire who seem to embody the <em>anything-is-possible mind-set</em>. Oprah, check. Long-distance swimmer Diana Nyad, check. Richard Branson, oh, hell yeah! Check. They’ve all taken tremendous risks to be where they are. They went after their dreams full force, believing they could absolutely happen even when the journey didn’t go exactly as planned. If Richard Branson had listened to all the doubters and naysayers when he started Virgin Galactic, or if he’d quit after devastating setbacks, we would not be well on our way to achieving commercial space flight and several other amazing advances. Can you imagine the doors he’s going to open for the world?</p>
<p class="indentpara">When I first started to create this change in my way of thinking, I would look to catch myself anytime I was tempted to slip into an “it’s all over,” “the chances are slim,” or “it’s just not going to happen” thought pattern and shift to “it’s not over yet!” and “it’s definitely possible!” instead. After a while, this effort changed the way my mind sees every situation.</p>
<p class="justifypara1">I’ve always been very optimistic. But even the most optimistic people can get saddled with limiting beliefs. Approaching life and everything you do with an ever-present knowing in your heart that <em><span id="page_58">anything</span> is possible</em> creates incredible momentum. And it changes the way you experience your life, creating more peace, joy, and vision in all you do.</p>
<p class="indentpara">ANYTHING is possible. Anything. Miracles are everywhere when we look and, especially, when we allow them to be. Part of allowing them to be is <em>believing</em> in them in the first place.</p>
<p class="indentpara">In the final section of this chapter, I’m going to share some techniques that really work to create these mind-set shifts and significant changes we can make to regain power over our thoughts, because our thoughts create our lives. Taking charge of them can be like herding cats, but once you practice and become great at it (and you will), your life will be forever changed.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Say it out loud: ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Believe it. Feels great, doesn’t it?</p>
<p class="subhead"><strong>THE HAPPINESS SUPER-SHIFT: THOUGHT MANAGEMENT</strong></p>
<p class="centerpara4"><em>“What do I think about when I strike out? I think about hitting home runs.”</em></p>
<p class="centerpara3">—Babe Ruth</p>
<p class="indentpara">If you’ve done any kind of personal development or spiritual work prior to picking up this book, you’re already aware how important our thoughts are in shaping our lives. You may have heard the saying “Thoughts become things,” and if you haven’t, well, it’s absolutely true. Thoughts are not just important; they are the entire foundation of our lives and how we live and encounter it.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Our thoughts are responsible for every choice we make, everything we create or destroy, and, yes, they’re responsible for the amount of happiness we experience. If you do just one thing after reading this book, commit yourself to increasing awareness of your thoughts and then changing the ones that need it. Thought awareness and management, or mindfulness, is the true key to owning your power over your thoughts and mind-sets and making them work for you to support your happiest life, rather than work against you.</p>
<p class="indentpara"><span id="page_59">Some</span> thoughts are so obvious, they’re pretty easy to catch and control, especially negative self-talk related to a current situation, like “I’m totally going to mess this interview up!” We all have negative self-talk now and then. I’m always working to stay on top of this and have created a huge positive shift. Now it’s rare, but when I do catch it, I turn the thoughts into loving, supportive ones toward myself, and it instantly makes everything so much better! Negative self-talk is super-damaging, unloving, and unnecessary, so this is the perfect place to begin creating a shift.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Beneath the more obvious, everyday negative thoughts, there are some that are so ingrained that we have to dig a little deeper to sweep them out, like dust bunnies in the back of our closets. We may not even realize they’re there until we pull some stuff back and look closer. They’re thoughts we’ve carried with us for years—“thought baggage” is a good way to describe them—and we want to lose these once and for all so we can replace them with awesome, supportive thoughts and affirmations.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Evergreen negative thoughts we’ve carried for a long time could include “I’m just not good at math” (oh, I was so guilty of that one for so long!), or “I had a difficult childhood” (why keep affirming this?), or <em>anything</em> that begins with “I hate . . .” or resembles an unnecessary complaint. Now, I’m a believer that some complaints, when constructive and respectful, are a necessary part of our self-care, so there is no need to ban all complaining. But we all know the difference between complaints that serve a purpose and ones that do nothing but create negative vibes.</p>
<p class="indentpara">The Laboratory of Neuro Imaging at the University of Southern California states that the number of thoughts the average person thinks per day is 70,000. Other estimates say it can range between 12,000 and 50,000. After a quick self-assessment, I came up with an average of about 17,500 for me. Wow! That’s a boatload of thoughts! Can you imagine the impact on our lives when a large chunk of those thoughts are negative? How that might be affecting us physically and emotionally?</p>
<p class="indentpara"><span id="page_60">Let’s</span> have a moment of realness right now. For the purpose of perspective, let’s say we have 20,000 thoughts per day. Take a moment and ask yourself what percentage of your thoughts lately could be considered negative or unsupportive. Close your eyes and think about this for a minute and let an honest answer come from your inner voice. Perhaps 30 percent? 50 percent? 70 percent? Then, using the 20,000 number as a total, do the math to figure out how many negative thoughts you’re having each day. For many people, this will be at least 50 percent on average, which is 10,000 negative thoughts per day. No matter your number, there is room to do some positive work in this area. It’s time to take the reins and seize control of your thoughts once and for all to empower your best life.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Each thought we have is energy. The incredible news here is that the frequency and light of that energy is <em>our choice</em>. We have more power than we realize to make the great majority of the thoughts we think positive, supportive, and healthy. It just takes mindful effort to create a profound shift.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Later on, we’ll dive into an entire chapter on how mindfully managing your first thoughts of the day can change your life. We’ll go even deeper on this topic, because I believe learning to change our thoughts is the path to changing our world. When I really got a handle on this, it was like I was completely in charge of my life for the first time ever! The change was <em>that</em> huge. We don’t realize how much our rambling, stray thoughts control us until we take control of them. Like all the practices and mind-sets I’m sharing in this book, it takes weeks or even months of dedication and practice to become good at it, but once you do, the positive change is miraculous.</p>
<p class="subhead1"><strong>Mindful Practice: Talk to Your Thoughts</strong></p>
<p class="justifypara">It may sound a little nuts, but believe it or not, actively talking to your thoughts—even having conversations with them in your mind—can be a super-effective way to consciously take control and create immediate change when you catch yourself in a pattern <span id="page_62">of</span> negative thinking. With this surprisingly effective (and kind of fun, once you get used to it) technique, you can empower yourself to create small shifts in your thinking by recognizing negative thoughts and actually conversing with them. Sometimes, I even speak to my thoughts out loud (with nobody else around, of course, or they’d probably be very concerned).</p>
<p class="indentpara">To begin, start to deliberately raise awareness of your thoughts on a consistent basis. When you notice a negative, unwanted, or draining thought, interrupt it and start a conversation with it from the positive, loving being that you are within. For example, if you catch yourself thinking “I’m afraid I’m going to mess up my job interview today,” acknowledge the thought and say something along the lines of “Thanks for showing up today, negative thought, but you’re not invited to this party. I’m going to rock this interview and they’re going to be so happy they took the time to meet with me!”</p>
<p class="indentpara">It may feel weird at first, but seriously, this works. You can use this anytime you notice negative thoughts or negative self-talk (jump in and defend yourself) or catch yourself thinking about things you know are not serving you at that moment (such as negative experiences from the past). This will help retrain your mind by interrupting negative thoughts and replacing them with higher-quality ones. After you do this for a while, you’ll feel a shift in your entire way of thinking. You’ll notice fewer negative thoughts and many more positive, joyful thought patterns. Your energy and the way you feel overall will be lighter.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Now I’m not saying to become all Pollyannaish. Of course, there is a purpose for some of the hurtful thoughts that creep in from time to time, and those sometimes need to be examined and resolved so we can let go and move forward. And it’s not to say we have to become perfect at being all positive all the time. That’s just not human. The idea is to greatly reduce our number of negative thoughts and replace them with healthy, uplifting, empowering thoughts. This is life changing.</p>
<p class="indentpara"><span id="page_63">When</span> I started consciously creating these interruptions and shifts in my thoughts a few years ago, I noticed instant changes in my entire demeanor. I can remember one instance where I was standing in my massively messy kitchen, thinking “I can’t believe I’m letting the kitchen get this gross. I’m the worst housekeeper. What’s wrong with me?” SO not productive. I caught this and said back to the thought, “Sorry, but you’re not contributing here. I’ve been very busy with wonderful things lately and the kitchen hasn’t been a priority. I’ll get to it soon enough.” Instantly, I went from feeling like crap about the kitchen to seeing not having cleaned it yet as a choice to use that energy where it was needed at the time to support my happiness. I felt lighter and more peaceful right away. Right on!</p>
<p class="indentpara1">I have to admit, I’ve also been known to swear at my negative thoughts now and then when inspired. An f-bomb here and there in the right context can be very empowering. Just saying.</p>
<div class="C563">
<p class="subhead2"><span id="page_61">Small</span> Shifts to Make Today</p>
<p class="leftpara1">To simplify getting started, here are the top three small shifts you can make that get big results.</p>
<p class="hanging1"><span class="C420">•</span><strong>Focus on what you want to attract.</strong> In most situations, especially those that involve fear, we tend to focus on what we don’t want instead of what we do want. When you catch yourself thinking about the outcome you don’t want (i.e., thoughts that begin with “I don’t want . . .” or “I hope this doesn’t. . . ,” etc.), pause and reverse them to thoughts that begin with “I’d like to see . . .” and “The outcome I’d like is. . . .” You’ll be amazed by how this will change your energy, experience, and even the outcome.</p>
<p class="hanging1"><span class="C420">•</span><strong>Unfriend your inner critic.</strong> Kick that negative naysayer to the curb. When you begin beating yourself up in your mind (or out loud) for anything, squash that negative self-talk! This doesn’t mean you should avoid personal responsibility for mistakes, but it does mean you should be kinder to yourself and ban all useless negative language about your beautiful self. You deserve kindness, always. Once you practice eliminating this, it will make a huge difference in how you feel overall. You’ll just be . . . a little lighter.</p>
<p class="hanging1"><span class="C420">•</span><strong>When you notice yourself in a stressful or bluesy place, ask yourself questions about the way you’re thinking in those moments.</strong> A great one I keep in my pocket is “Is the way I’m thinking right now encouraging or discouraging?” That question always produces a clarifying answer and is like a turbo boost for an immediate change in vibration. You can also try asking, “Is there another way I can look at this that might be more supportive?</p>
</div>
<p class="subhead1"><strong>Getting Started</strong></p>
<p class="justifypara">To get accustomed to the concept of conversing with your thoughts, try taking a sheet of paper or your journal and list a few of the thoughts you’ve had lately that could have been changed to better serve your happiness. Next to them, list the thoughts that could replace them and make them empowering. This will help you to get clear on how to converse with those pesky negative thoughts when they pop in. Then you can start doing this in your mind, and you’ll notice immediate results. And I’m talking immediate. Have fun with it. Stick with it. This will support you for a long time to become another effective tool in your Operation Happiness toolkit.</p>
<p class="indentpara">I encourage you to go deep in living and <em>becoming</em> the mindsets I’ve covered in this chapter. Work at it. You will see immediate changes, but it will take time and mindful dedication to create lasting results that will form the fundamental parts of your happiness <span id="page_64">foundation.</span> (There are excellent books available on each one. See the <a href="21_SUGGESTED_READING.xhtml#page_245">Suggested Reading</a> section.) It’s not about being perfect, it’s about elevating and expanding each of these mind-sets in your heart, consciousness, and life. Choose them over and over, practice them, and deliberately operate from them until they become part of your DNA. It will change everything.</p>
