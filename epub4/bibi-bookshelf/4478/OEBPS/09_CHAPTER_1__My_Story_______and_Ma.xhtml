<p class="chhead2">My Story . . . and Major Perception Changes</p>
<p class="justifypara"><span class="fontsize">As I was sitting</span> in my light-filled studio recently, working long hours on the proposal for this book, I received an urgent text from my brother Scott.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Scott: Are you sitting in front of your computer?</p>
<p class="indentpara">Me: Yes.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Scott: I’m sending you a link and then calling you.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Seconds later, the phone rang. Before I could say hello, he asked anxiously, “Did it come? Click on the link!”</p>
<p class="indentpara">“What is it?”</p>
<p class="indentpara">“Just open the link!”</p>
<p class="indentpara">I clicked, and a page with a photo of a joyful-looking couple appeared, along with a news article announcing that they had made a contribution to a local charity. I blinked twice, without the faintest idea why he was sending me this completely random, albeit positive piece of information.</p>
<p class="indentpara">“Are you looking at the link?” he asked.</p>
<p class="indentpara">I was shaking my head. I wanted to get off the phone and back to writing. “Yes, what is it?”</p>
<p class="indentpara">He launched into words that would permanently change the dynamic of my family.</p>
<p class="indentpara"><span id="page_4">“</span>That’s Mom’s biological sister. Our aunt. And I just got off the phone with her.”</p>
<p class="indentpara">My breath halted.</p>
<p class="indentpara">“At first, she didn’t believe what I was telling her, that she had a sister and that I’m her nephew, but I sent her copies of records and some photos, and she definitely believes me now. And . . . Mom’s mother is alive and well at eighty-eight years old.”</p>
<p class="indentpara">Suddenly, I felt like I was in a lucid dream. My brain went into overdrive trying to sort out what this might mean for my family. It was a moment I thought would never happen. I’m talking <em>never.</em> I’d put the idea of ever being connected to that side of my family out of my mind and heart years ago. Sitting there in my old, worn office chair where I’ve spent countless hours writing, everything changed in an instant. My life, and the lives of my mother and brother, were forever shifted.</p>
<p class="indentpara">My mother was born in 1946, just after the war. Her mother was very young and couldn’t keep her, so she gave my mother up for adoption. Although a wonderful, loving family raised my mother, she always had a deep desire to know where she came from. An embedded desire . . . on a cellular level.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Over the years, she had looked for her biological mother but, at some point, gave up on the idea and worked very hard to let it go, unwavering curiosity burning in a closed little box in her heart. Her mother went on with her life and kept the secret of my mother’s birth for nearly sixty-seven years. Sixty. Seven. Years.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Growing up, I’d always wondered about it, too. It’s strange to go through life knowing that you have another grandmother, a grandfather, and probably aunts, uncles, and cousins who have no idea you exist. But yet I, too, had tucked that wonder away in a box. I so strongly believed I would never know about that part of my family, I hadn’t even thought about it for years.</p>
<p class="indentpara">My mother and her sister are beyond overjoyed to have found each other. It’s been amazing to watch their meaningful, sisterly <span id="page_5">bond</span> grow. Each had lost her other siblings and thought she was the last one surviving, until my brother connected them. Imagine . . . in midlife, after losing your siblings, discovering a wonderful sister you never knew existed! It’s an amazing story. A miracle, really.</p>
<p class="indentpara">In the midst of these delicious events for my family, I found a powerful message. I believe I’m a wildly openhearted person and always do my best to carry a mind-set of <em>anything can happen</em>. <em>Anything.</em> I worked hard to adopt that mind-set, which has supported me greatly. Before I received that text from my brother, if you had asked me if there was anything—anything at all—I believed would <em>never</em> happen in my life, I probably would have answered absolutely not. <em>Never</em> is a word I don’t particularly dig.</p>
<p class="indentpara">But with the unexpected discovery of my biological aunt and grandmother, I realized that this particular <em>never</em> was buried so deep, my belief about it so absolute, I didn’t even realize it was there! If there was anything at all I truly believed would never happen, this was it. Never. Until it did.</p>
<p class="indentpara">I share this with you because it’s a fantastic example of exactly what this first part of <em>Operation Happiness</em> is about: <em>changing your view</em>. Being willing to shift things you’ve firmly believed, or not believed, for your entire life.</p>
<p class="indentpara">You will begin to change your view by searching for and opening those boxes hidden within your heart that hold deeply embedded limiting beliefs about happiness and keep you from your most incredible life; you will have to be <em>willing</em> to replace those beliefs with new ideas and perspective. Give yourself the gift of a blank slate. It’s the first step to creating a permanent, positive shift and opening yourself to an entirely new level of amazing.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Be open, be willing, clear your heart, and get ready to let a whole new light in.</p>
<p class="subhead"><strong><span id="page_6">MY</span> QUEST TO DECODE HAPPINESS</strong></p>
<p class="justifypara">I truly love myself and my life. But believe me, it wasn’t always that way. When I was growing up and all through my twenties, my life, for the most part, seemed like a consistent stream of struggle and mediocrity with a few highs here and there. But over the past twelve years, I’ve learned to embrace my truth as well as live by it. I’ve learned how to catch myself and make a shift when I’m stepping on my own toes and how to get out of my own way. I’ve stopped beating myself up and instead treat myself with understanding and compassion, knowing that I’m always doing the best I can. Most important, I’ve learned what happiness is and how to allow it to be the driving force of my life.</p>
<p class="indentpara">I wake up every morning filled with huge gratitude to finally be happy—and in complete control of my happiness. Along my path, I discovered a huge, life-altering truth about happiness, which I’m going to share with you in this chapter.</p>
<p class="indentpara">My own journey toward a permanent foundation for happiness that sustains and serves me daily was quite long. When I firmly decided at thirty-one years old that there had to be a better way to live, I dedicated myself passionately to studies of happiness, spirituality, and personal development, determined to change my life.</p>
<p class="indentpara">I made that decision in a definitive moment. It was early one cloudy, humid morning in the early summer of 2002, as I was once again lying in bed in a frustratingly dark place, absolutely dreading the day ahead. I’d been going through a ridiculously difficult time at work and within myself.</p>
<p class="indentpara">What I’d thought was my dream job had turned out to be a soul-crushing disappointment, and I felt like a cat stuck in a box, scratching and clawing with no way out. On top of it all, I was in the middle of planning my wedding and had all this crazy talk going on in my monkey mind: “Will he still want to marry me if I’m unemployed?” and “If I tell him I don’t want this corporate job, fancy car, or fast-paced party life anymore, will he think I’m a <span id="page_7">fraud?”</span> In many moments, it felt like every part of my world was literally imploding.</p>
<p class="indentpara">As I was lying there that morning, I received a loud message from within the center of my soul that, until hitting this wall of extreme darkness, I’d been unwilling to hear. The message was clear: In spite of everything that was causing my angst, frustration, and emotional pain at that time, the core foundation and creator of the problems was me.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Me? The problem? This was a new concept. How could I be the problem? I was a victim of circumstance!</p>
<p class="indentpara">But somehow, in that moment, I saw clearly for the first time that I was the major player, the MVP in fact, in every area my life, and if I chose to be, I could be in complete control. I had all the power in the world to create positive change, to escape the crazy, stressful situations I had chosen and continued to allow—and I hadn’t been tapping into that power.</p>
<p class="indentpara">The only person who could change my world of gloom, mediocrity, and anxiety was me. I could choose to take leaps. I could choose to stop tolerating things that drained me or didn’t bring me happiness. And I could choose to leave behind the sharks that had been circling me and swim with the angelfish instead.</p>
<p class="indentpara">It was a huge realization. I knew then that if I really wanted the best in life, it was time for me to look in the mirror, take responsibility for my own destiny, and <em>offer my very best back to life.</em> I had not been giving to the world what I wanted to receive.</p>
<p class="indentpara">I decided to find new strength, take charge, and do everything I could to make the shifts I needed to be happy and at peace, and to start living the life I knew I deserved. I had no idea where to begin, but I knew one thing for sure: There was a better way to live.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Until that morning that rocked my world, I’d been a young PR executive at a major entertainment studio. I had an office with a view of the Hollywood Sign, a gorgeous convertible, a huge wardrobe, a charismatic fiancé, and invitations to fantastic parties every week. On the outside, it seemed like I had an amazing life. I was <span id="page_8">convinced</span> that I did have an amazing life, and that this must be how I was supposed to be living, because everyone told me how great it was. This is the life I’d been <em>conditioned</em> to strive for.</p>
<p class="indentpara">The truth was, even with all that great stuff going on, I was incredibly empty and unhappy inside, and I was very good at hiding it. I was so good, in fact, that the way I’d been surviving the tumultuous storm inside me was by working very hard to hide it from <em>myself</em>. I tried to remain in denial as much as I could. On some days, I couldn’t deny it, and I would just wonder what on earth was wrong with me.</p>
<p class="indentpara">The corporate environment I was in at the time was highly toxic. I was working extremely long days and constantly dodging negative, venomous people. I was watching the few kind people around me either quit from the stress or get systematically pushed out for standing up for themselves. I spent most days lying low, wishing I were somewhere else.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Like many, I thought one of the answers to filling the emptiness was lots of stuff. I shopped like a crazy girl. I was making pretty good money for the first time in my life and was on a mission to find the next <em>thing</em> to make me happy.</p>
<p class="indentpara">I went to parties, polluted myself with too many cocktails, and burned the candle at both ends, thinking I was creating a great life for myself and, somehow, some way, it would lead to happiness. But it seemed that no matter what I did, I was unfulfilled. I was simply existing rather than living. The more I chased the wrong things, the emptier I felt. I wanted to be anyone but me.</p>
<p class="indentpara">One night, I was awakened by what felt like my heart exploding out of my chest. I was shaking and in a cold sweat. My pillow was soaked. I sprung up, took a few deep breaths, and realized I was reacting physically to the stress of my downward spiral. My body was finally telling me to wake the hell up or face major consequences.</p>
<p class="indentpara">The next morning, that wise inner voice spoke up (no, screamed) and finally opened my mind to see that <em>I had the power</em> to change my situation—and my perception—as long as I was willing to take <span id="page_9">responsibility</span> for allowing it in the first place. I’m a creative person. Why wasn’t I using that creativity to shape the life I truly wanted to live?</p>
<p class="indentpara">It was time to make some big changes, and that included going on an epic mission to discover exactly what it takes to be happy. I left the job. I had nothing else lined up; I just left and trusted that life would create a perfect opportunity. I only had enough money in savings for a few months’ expenses, and I knew time would go quickly. It was the biggest leap of faith I’d ever dared to take. It was the first time I’d truly trusted the universe, and that changed everything.</p>
<p class="indentpara">I dropped all negative and draining obligations, stopped partying, gave away much of my stuff, and dove into every book and lecture I could find about transition, metaphysics, health, and happiness. I became fascinated with neuroscience and the power of the mind. I channeled all my newfound energy into learning, growing, making better choices, and creating a better life. I started my own boutique PR firm, empowered by the idea of working for myself on my own terms. Oh, and somewhere in the middle of all that, I got married. And no, he didn’t think I was a fraud.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Over the next couple of years, I found so many conflicting views on what happiness is, how to achieve it, and how to sustain it, it made my head spin. With so much mixed information, some of it incredible and some of it complete crap, I felt called to set out on a quest to demystify happiness. To crack the code and simplify it in a way that I could fully understand and achieve happiness. It would be the journey of my life, and it would lead me to the work I do today.</p>
<p class="indentpara">So for a few years I kept at it. Making shifts, researching, growing. Many of the concepts and tools I learned did make a big difference. Through trial and error, weeding out the BS, and testing out some new theories of my own, I changed my life in powerful ways, reaching a higher level of peace and experiencing more frequent joy than I ever had before. It was a significant positive change. I couldn’t believe how my world was turning around and <span id="page_10">how</span> much I’d been missing. The more I changed my thoughts to be positive and loving, the more I cut myself a break and took the stance of self-compassion; the more I took action to create necessary lifestyle changes, the more I felt warmth and light fill my world.</p>
<p class="indentpara">But I knew in my gut there had to be more. I was still experiencing random, short bouts of depression and often felt apathetic about everyday events. I wanted to create a way of life that would bring a sustainable state of overall happiness and peace, a sense of daily enthusiasm, and give me more solid ground to stand on during the tough times.</p>
<p class="indentpara">I stayed on the course of my happiness mission over the next few years, continuing to filter things out, discovering what worked, and creating more positive changes. But I still didn’t have a clear definition of happiness so it could be explained, understood, and realized. I was still looking for that “Hell yes! That’s it!” moment. Then, in 2008, something sudden and unexpected happened that completely derailed my life, catapulted me into the most challenging battle I’d ever faced, and with it, brought a tremendous gift—the answers I’d been searching for.</p>
<p class="subhead1"><strong>The Fight That Brought the Light</strong></p>
<p class="justifypara">I don’t remember exactly how it happened that day when I was getting out of the bathtub. Maybe I was still loopy from the anesthesia or the painkillers and lost my balance. Maybe I slipped. Or maybe some part of me just felt the need to be on the floor for a while. The floor can sometimes feel like a comforting, safe place to cry.</p>
<p class="indentpara">I was cold and shaking, but my head felt hot. Instead of asking for help like a rational person who’d just had major surgery would, I decided, with one usable arm and legs I could barely stand on, to hoist myself out of the bathtub in the direction of the fluffy white towel on the counter. I wasn’t thinking clearly, but I did know that after months of unrelenting, piercing pain, absent sleep, and inabil<span id="page_11">ity</span> to function physically the way I used to, my soul felt vacant—chewed up and scattered into nothingness. And it felt like my body was going with it.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Four months earlier, I’d woken up one morning feeling like someone had hit me in the shoulder with a large, heavy object. But I couldn’t remember injuring that arm. Maybe I tweaked it in my sleep? I could barely move it, and when I tried to move even my fingertips, pain would shoot all the way up my arm and into my ear. I tried icing it, hoping it would improve, but by the next day, I couldn’t move my shoulder, or my arm, at all. It felt like some humongous dude was literally holding my arm against my side and beating me with a heavy stick at the same time.</p>
<p class="indentpara">An orthopedic surgeon diagnosed me with a little-known condition called adhesive capsulitis. It’s better known as frozen shoulder, which sounds much more docile than it actually is. It’s a debilitating, mysterious disease that fuses the tissues and joint of the shoulder together, leaving a person in relentless, stabbing pain for months on end, unable to move the arm because everything has grown together. The medical community has no idea what causes it, and there is no cure. They speculate that it may be autoimmune. The only blessing is that for some unexplained reason, it resolves on its own somewhere between one and three years.</p>
<p class="indentpara">For many months, I couldn’t do the most basic things I’d always taken for granted. The slightest movement was unbearably painful. I’d lost the use of my arm. Dressing myself, buttoning a shirt, driving, washing my hair, even just reading a book was physically impossible. Wow, do I appreciate these, and so many other things, every single second now!</p>
<p class="indentpara">Like many with this condition, I opted for surgery with the hope that it might speed up the healing process. No luck. Shortly after that, I found myself spread out on the frigid linoleum next to the tub.</p>
<p class="indentpara">I’m pretty sure the blaring, heaving sobs started on the way <span id="page_12">down.</span> There must have been a thud, because my husband came running into the bathroom and was standing over me, a little stunned.</p>
<p class="indentpara">I glanced up at him, and even through my blurry tears I could tell by the look on his face that he really wasn’t quite sure what to do with this sad, shattered creature. I watched him, in what seemed like slow motion, reach for the towel and begin to unfold it. Wet, shaking, and bruised, I somehow caught my breath enough to look up at him pleadingly and wail, “Why is this happening?” I’d hit bottom.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Later that night, lying in a blissfully cozy bed and still wrapped in the damp cotton towel, my thoughts finally were clear. A pack of frozen blueberries rested on my shoulder, creating a stark contrast against the warm sheets that felt strangely peaceful. I could hear “Satisfaction” by the Rolling Stones faintly playing from somewhere in the house and smiled at the irony. It occurred to me then that this was the first smile I had cracked in a long while, and it turned into a desperate-sounding giggle. I was so elated to feel this organic laugh pop out of me, more tears began to flow. I wiped them away with the towel, still smiling, and then a shift occurred that would finally get me headed in the right direction.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Nuzzling my head into the pillow and reflecting on the crazy drama from earlier that evening, I remembered the only sentence I’d been able to form in the middle of it: “Why is this happening?” That seemed like a legitimate question at the time. Who wouldn’t ask it in that situation?</p>
<p class="indentpara">What happened next was a classic lightbulb moment. In searching for the answer, I realized that “Why is this happening?” was not the right question. The question I needed to be asking, which really in itself is the answer to the <em>why,</em> was “What can I learn from this?” I had learned through my metaphysical studies that this question is always effective in a crazy situation, because there is always something to learn. To be discovered. To be healed. It’s a comforting question that can reveal a silver lining.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Lying in bed with the damp towel, a bag of ice-cold blueberries, <span id="page_13">and</span> the Rolling Stones to console me, the question “What can I learn from this?” brought me to a major change in perception. I knew I had many months of physical therapy ahead and wouldn’t be able to work much, if at all, during that time. I also knew being a caregiver was taking a toll on my husband, and the energy needed to shift. I decided to look at the time I had ahead of me as an amazing opportunity to focus all day, every single day, on finally decoding happiness. On becoming the super-healthy, peaceful, happy person I’d been working to be. I’d challenged myself to commit to it full-time, with absolute focus and intent. I was determined to heal my life and become a superstar version of me. Enter <em>Operation Happiness</em>!</p>
<p class="indentpara">Not long after I shifted to this new path, my body and spirit began to heal rapidly. I continued to study and practice everything I could when it came to happiness, healing, and whole living. I woke up every morning with the very deliberate intent to be happy that day. I indulged in my enthusiasm for connecting with nature by spending more time outside and gardening as part of my physical therapy. I switched to a mostly pescatarian diet (a diet that excludes meat, except for some seafood), started blending organic fruit and vegetable smoothies, and began checking out raw foods.</p>
<p class="indentpara">For quite some time, meditation, affirmations, and listening to lectures on healing and personal growth became the most important parts of my day. iTunes and my hot pink iPod were my new best friends.</p>
<p class="indentpara">After almost thirteen months, all the crazy hard work had paid off. I had most of the movement back in my arm, the pain had become bearable, and I could finally drive, work, and wash my own hair again. <em>Halle-freakin’-lujah!</em> Even better than all that, I felt like a completely new person. A happy person!</p>
<p class="indentpara">Soon I realized I absolutely <em>was</em> a new person. I was a person who’d created a successful foundation of habits, mind-sets, and daily activities that supported sustainable, authentic happiness even through the darkest days. And I was totally blown away by it.</p>
<p class="indentpara"><span id="page_14">After</span> I’d recovered from all the health hurdles and settled back into my regular daily life, I began to notice that the happiness I was feeling wasn’t wavering. Every day, I was living naturally in a state of positivity, joy, and ease. Without much thought, I was kind to myself, living an overall healthier existence, and pausing regularly and deliberately to take notice and find amazement in cool little stuff that had seemed so ordinary before. There were no more “space-between” gaps with crappy-for-no-reason days or weeks. It was just a peaceful, stable, seemingly permanent happiness that was naturally present within me every day. That’s not to say there were no crappy-for-<em>good</em>-reason days, but I was handling even those days amazingly well with completely different thought patterns and actions. It was an entirely new energy and way of being. It all seemed to be coming so easily.</p>
<p class="indentpara">At that point, I knew I had something. I took a big step back and looked closely at my journey of the past year. What specific changes had I made that brought me to this new way of life? What had <em>finally</em> made the difference?</p>
<p class="indentpara">I wanted to figure this out precisely so I could stay in this great place. And it occurred to me that others might be interested in what changes I’d made as well. I’m a huge believer that when you find an awesome, effective solution to a common problem, you should grab a megaphone and shout it out! Right?</p>
<p class="indentpara">After digging in and checking out what seemed to finally support me in my newfound place of daily joy, I narrowed it down to three powerful shifts. Three. It all began to add up. Those three key shifts in perfect combination led to a permanent <em>foundation</em> to support my happiest, most incredible life. They led to a complete reprogramming of my mind-sets and habits. <em>This</em> is what had always been missing. Together those shifts permanently changed my life for the better. It’s my heart’s desire to walk you through the same three shifts in this book.</p>
<p class="indentpara"><em>Operation Happiness</em> is my megaphone.</p>
<p class="indentpara">This leads me back to what I mentioned at the beginning of this <span id="page_15">chapter,</span> and the point of this chapter: <em>changing your view</em>. Changing the way I viewed happiness was the first of the three key shifts that created overwhelming change. After all, incredible transformation always begins with a change in perspective.</p>
<p class="subhead"><strong>THE MISSING LINK TO HAPPINESS</strong></p>
<p class="justifypara">So how exactly did I <em>change my view</em> of happiness? Well, during that year of recovery from the shoulder debacle, I was making a daily, conscious, and deliberate effort to live happiness once and for all. Basically, I just applied all the most valuable skills and happiness concepts I’d learned over the past few years on an enormous prevailing level. Happiness caffeinated.</p>
<p class="indentpara">It started a bit rough, almost like trying to squeeze on jeans that are too tight. Getting up in the morning and focusing so hard on happiness even felt uncomfortable at times because I wasn’t used to making it my absolute number-one priority.</p>
<p class="indentpara">In the beginning, I was waking up with a sigh and strongly nudging myself to do things I hadn’t done on a regular basis before. Short meditations; yoga poses; eating super-clean, nourishing foods; catching and correcting negative thought patterns; using positive affirmations. I immersed myself 24/7 in happiness habits and practices.</p>
<p class="indentpara">You know how they say the best way to learn a new language is to immerse yourself in it? Well, that’s exactly what happened. After a few months of daily, conscious, forceful effort to create new habits, change my mind-sets, and make the things that brought me joy a top priority, a giant shift took place within my core, and it all started to come naturally. Every day, I was living on a foundation of consistent happiness habits, practices for inner peace, and supportive, positive mind-sets that came with ease and little effort. It no longer felt uncomfortable, and it no longer felt like work.</p>
<p class="indentpara">This led me to a <em>major</em> realization that was so incredible it literally changed me at the core: <em>Happiness is a skill</em>.</p>
<p class="indentpara"><span id="page_16">Yes,</span> happiness is widely known as a choice, a feeling, a state of being . . . overlooked, it’s actually a skill that can be learned, cultivated, and mastered—just like playing the violin or riding a bike.</p>
<p class="indentpara">The skill of happiness—just like playing an instrument—is made up of many facets and habits we can <em>learn</em>. Embracing and following this simple idea is profoundly life-changing. And once we learn the skill of happiness, just like any other skill that we learn, practice, and become good at . . . that’s it! The hardest part of the journey is over.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Happiness is the required skill for living our very best life that they forgot to teach us in school. Think about it this way. If playing the violin were mandatory to thriving and living our best life, wouldn’t you be kind of pissed if you’d graduated high school without learning how? And if you didn’t discover this fact about the violin until you were, say, in your thirties or forties, would you beat yourself up for not knowing how to play? Of course not! Because nobody taught you while growing up or even told you this was a skill you needed! You’d pick up a violin and sign up for lessons ASAP, right? It’s time we begin to look at the skill of happiness in this way and make it a higher priority, both in our lives and in society.</p>
<p class="justifypara1">This is an extraordinary realization for all those who have struggled for years, frustrated and wondering why they haven’t had sustainable, lasting happiness. Like me until my late thirties, they simply never learned <em>how to do it.</em> This one astonishing concept is the missing link that’s been holding so many back from creating the happiness they desire.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Consciously cultivating and actively creating our own happiness <span id="page_17">is</span> perhaps our most vital life skill. It’s the foundation for all that is wonderful. What we’re traditionally taught is most important—career, financial success, relationships—is nothing without it.</p>
<p class="indentpara">When I finally understood this, I felt a bit heavyhearted that I’d gone my entire life until that point lacking the most important skill. Growing up, we learned how to add and subtract, how to read, and the table of elements, but our well-meaning educators skipped the most important subject for thriving in this world: how to create a lasting, permanent foundation for happiness. They forgot to teach us! Perhaps because they never learned themselves.</p>
<p class="indentpara">In understanding this, I had a moment where I felt like Molly Ringwald in <em>Sixteen Candles</em> when she says, “I can’t believe this. They fucking forgot my birthday!” Only to me it was, “I can’t believe this. They fucking forgot to teach me how to be happy!”</p>
<p class="indentpara">I soon realized it wasn’t that they actually forgot. It was that we’ve gone generation after generation neglecting to make this essential life skill part of what we teach our kids. Basically, the adults in our lives when we were growing up hadn’t been taught either.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Imagine what the world would look like if children were never taught mathematics in school, and they were all sent out into the world to figure it out for themselves. Really . . . think about this. What would happen over a number of decades to advancement? Science? Business? I believe the absence of a curriculum on happiness and emotional health in schools has had a massive and unfortunate impact on our lives and on the world.</p>
<p class="indentpara">So there you have it. Begin now to think of happiness not just as a choice, a feeling, or a state of mind . . . but as a <em>skill</em>. A skill that can be learned, practiced, and even for the most part mastered. It’s a required skill. It’s also a <em>way of life</em>.</p>
<p class="indentpara">In my research, I came across a quote from the Greek philosopher Aristotle that perfectly illustrates happiness as a skill. In fact, it’s part of what helped me focus on the incredible significance of this concept.</p>
<p class="indentpara"><span id="page_18">“</span><em>Happiness is a state of activity</em>.”</p>
<p class="indentpara">This is a tremendously powerful thought. Thinking of happiness as something we <em>do</em>, as something we actively participate in creating, rather than something we simply feel, can change the way we approach our happiness and our lives.</p>
<p class="indentpara">This is another big perception shift; happiness is absolutely a feeling and a state of well-being, but the key to happiness is understanding that it is created through action. And learning the <em>skill</em> of happiness helps us to consistently and naturally take the actions to shape and live our happiest, most dynamic life.</p>
<p class="justifypara1">Two kinds of action, or activity, are involved in the skill of happiness. The first is action we take within ourselves emotionally and spiritually. This includes consciously and deliberately choosing our thoughts (just like we would select an outfit for a night on the town); tuning in to connect with our inner voice and our bodies; meditating; and changing our default outlook so that we’re always (or nearly always) consciously and unconsciously seeking joy, love, beauty, and light in everything around us. This is where it all begins.</p>
<p class="indentpara">The second involves physically doing things, even the smallest things, that consistently renew and refuel our happiness and well-being. The list of activities that can spark happiness is endless and different for everyone. The secret is for each individual to consciously recognize exactly which activities fuel their happiness flames and to add them to their toolbox.</p>
<p class="indentpara">As you move through the rest of this book, give yourself the gift of a beginner’s mind. A clean slate. Perhaps take a day or two after reading this chapter, or at least sleep on it, to clear your mind and <span id="page_19">start</span> fresh in approaching and thinking about happiness. Close your eyes, feel light fill your heart, and let feelings of openness and willingness to do things differently bubble to the surface.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Through the three powerful shifts I’ve made to build my own happiness foundation, we will get you started in forming your own: a solid, supportive ground to start from each day in creating your most incredible, joyful life. If you’re willing to commit to doing the work (just as you would if you were passionately learning a new language or computer application), your life will forever change. I can’t promise it will be easy, but I can tell you that if you stick with it for as long as it takes you to feel the shift in your core, you will reach a magical new level of consistent, sustainable happiness.</p>
<p class="indentpara">You can start to make changes and apply new tools and ideas in this book right away, but the true breakthrough will come when you continue to practice them for many, many months beyond, just like I did for more than a year during my recovery. That’s the secret. Do it until it feels natural. Until your entire way of life—your way of being—changes without much thought. You’ll feel the shift in every cell when it happens, just like you feel a shift when something becomes a habit or when you realize you’ve finally got something down you’ve been trying to learn.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Think of your new skill of happiness just like brushing your teeth: You need do it consistently and deliberately every day, more than once, or else funky, rotten stuff will begin to sneak in.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Now that I have you thinking of happiness as a skill, in the next two chapters we’re going to work on some additional perspective shifts, supportive mind-sets, and essential tools, all part of changing your view on a number of levels. This will become the base for the other two of the three major happiness shifts, <em>changing your mornings</em> and <em>changing your habits.</em></p>
<p class="indentpara">I’m so excited to share all this with you. With all my heart, thank you so much for being here. The rest of this book is filled <span id="page_20">with</span> awesome, life-changing spirit candy, and I’m ecstatic you’re here to share it with me.</p>
<p class="indentpara">Will you do me a favor right now? Take a little break. Put this book down and go do something that makes you feel happy. Something small, whatever it may be. A bath, a great glass of wine, a ridiculous guilty-pleasure TV show. Whatever—as long as it makes you feel good and gives you a bit of time to digest the initial stages of thinking about happiness in an entirely new way.</p>
<p class="indentpara">We’re going to create some amazing changes together!</p>
