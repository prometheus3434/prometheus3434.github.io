         <p class="fp" id="rw-fp_394714-00001"><span class="dropcap">N</span><span class="sc">OW THE UNEXPECTED HAPPENED</span>, and yet, though unexpected, it was one of the most ordinary things on earth—a young woman fell in love with a young man. In the long run Nature cannot be repressed. Mary, a woman with warm blood and healthy senses, was at this momentous period in her destiny on the threshold of her twenty-third year, the most appropriate age for an ardent passion. She had now been four years a widow, and fully abstinent, for her conduct in sexual matters was irreproachable. The time had come when feeling was to have its way with her, when the woman in the Queen was to demand her most sacred right, the right to love and to be loved.
         </p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394714-00001">The object of her first passion was, strangely enough, no other than the man who was a suitor for political reasons; no other than Darnley, whom his mother had sent to Scotland in this month of January 1565. Mary had already made the young man’s acquaintance. Four years earlier, when he was a lad of fifteen, he had come to France in order to bring his mother’s condolences to the widow of Francis II. At that time, however, Mary had been in a mournful mood; and in any case she would have been unlikely to regard this hobbledehoy as a possible future wooer. Since then, Darnley had grown into a tall and vigorous young fellow. He was (as Melville has told us) fair-haired, beardless, with a pretty, womanish face, from which two large, round eyes looked forth somewhat uncertainly into the world. “<i>Il n’est possible de voir un plus beau prince</i>”<i>—</i>It is not possible to see a more handsome prince—was the description given of him by the French ambassador Mauvissière; and the young Queen herself speaks of him as “the handsomest and best-proportioned long man” she has ever seen. Proneness to illusion was part of the fiery and impatient temperament of Mary Stuart. As with all who are romantically inclined, she had little knowledge either of the world or of men. Daydreamers such as she rarely see things in their true light; facile enthusiasms making them discern, rather, what they want to discern. Sobriety is foreign to such unteachables, who vacillate between the extremes of delight and disappointment; and, on awakening from one illusion, they do so only to become victims of a new one—since illusion, not reality, is for them the real world! Thus it came to pass that Mary, in her quickly kindled liking for the tall, smooth-chinned young Darnley, failed to perceive that beneath the comely surface there was no depth, that there was no moral strength in this man of powerful muscles, no intellectual culture to back up his courtly manners. Unaffected by her puritan environment, she could see no more than that the young prince had a good seat on horseback, danced gracefully, was fond of music and of cheerful conversation, and could, on occasion, write pretty verses. Such artistic accomplishments always made a strong appeal to her. She was delighted to find in Darnley an agreeable comrade in the ballroom, at the chase and in her other amusements. His coming was a refreshment, since he brought an aroma of youth into this tedious court. Others besides the Queen took a liking to Darnley who, acting on his mother’s shrewd advice, behaved modestly. Soon he had become a welcome guest throughout Edinburgh, “well liked for his personage”, as Randolph, Elizabeth’s spy, reported to the latter. He played his part of wooer adroitly, courting the favour not only of Mary Stuart, but of all and sundry. He struck up a close friendship with David Rizzio, the Queen’s new private secretary and an initiate of the Counter-Reformation. Day after day Darnley and Rizzio played tennis together; at night they slept in the same bed. But while Darnley thus got into close contact with the Catholic party, at the same time he wanted to stand well with the Protestants. On Sundays he accompanied Prime Minister James Stuart to kirk, where he listened with well-simulated attention to the sermons of John Knox. To avert suspicion, he often took his midday meals with the English ambassador, and was careful to say soft things of Queen Elizabeth. In the evening he danced by turns with the five Marys. In a word, his obedience to his mother’s instructions making up for his lack of intelligence, he got on well at the Scottish court and, for the very reason that he was personally insignificant, it was easy for him to avoid suspicion.
         </p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394714-00002">Suddenly, however, a spark kindled in the Queen’s heart. Mary Stuart, who had famous kings and princes as wooers, herself began to woo this foolish stripling of nineteen. Passion flamed up in her, as it is apt to do in those who have not prematurely frittered away their feelings in petty love adventures. For Mary, Darnley was the object of her first great passion. Her child marriage to Francis II had made of her little more than the young King’s playmate. Since Francis’ death, the woman in her had remained in abeyance. Now she had come into contact with a man upon whom her affection could discharge itself like a torrent. Unreflectingly, in the happy intoxication of self-forgetfulness, she gave herself up to the rush of feeling, in the belief that Darnley was all she could have dreamt of, was to be the one and only love of her life.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394714-00003">To expect reasonableness from a young woman in love is to look for the sun at midnight. It is of the essence of the love passion to be unanalysable and irrational. Always it is outside the range of mathematical calculations. Beyond question Mary Stuart’s choice of Darnley conflicted sharply with the general excellence of her understanding. The young man was crude, vain, with nothing to commend him but good looks. Like countless other men who have been passionately loved by women of outstanding intelligence, Darney’s only merit, his only magic, was that he chanced to be the man who, at the decisive hour, presented himself to a young woman whose willto-love had long been pent up.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394714-00004">Long, too long, had been the pause before the amatory passions of this proud daughter of the Stuarts were aroused. Now, after this time of waiting, she was impatient, was twitching with eagerness. When Mary Stuart wanted anything, she was not inclined to wait and to consider; as soon as she had made up her mind, her impulses urged her to action. The woman forgot the Queen; political considerations did not weigh with her for a moment. What mattered England or France or Spain, what mattered the future, as compared with the entrancing present? She would no longer trifle with Elizabeth’s proposal of Leicester as husband, nor would she await the slothful wooer from Madrid even though he was to bring her the crown of two worlds. Here, ready to her hand, was the bright-visaged, gentle and voluptuous youth, with his full, red lips, his childlike eyes, his cautious advances! A speedy alliance, that she might give herself to him unrestrainedly—such was the unquestioning impulse of her happily awakened senses. At first, however, she confided her intention to only one person at court, David Rizzio, who did his utmost, like a skilful smuggler, to guide the lovers’ ship past all rocks into the harbour of Cythera. A confidant of the Pope, Rizzio believed that Mary’s marriage to the Catholic Darnley would ensure the re-establishment of the old Church in Scotland. His zeal for the union was the outcome, not so much of a desire for Mary’s happiness or for Henry’s, as of the political scheming of a champion of the Counter-Reformation. Before James Stuart or Maitland of Lethington, the effective rulers of Scotland, had any notion of Mary’s intentions, the young Italian had written to the Pope for the dispensation requisite to the marriage, since Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, was Mary’s cousin. Foreseeing every possible difficulty, Rizzio likewise wrote to Philip II to ask whether Mary could count upon the King of Spain’s help should Elizabeth make trouble about the marriage. Both by day and by night this confidential agent was hard at work, for Rizzio believed that the rising of the two stars would promote his own ascent in the courtly heaven as well as the triumph of Catholicism. But for all that he drove his mines so busily, he worked too slowly and too cautiously for Mary’s impatience. She would not be stayed for weeks and weeks while the letters took their tedious course across seas and lands. There would not be any hitch in the negotiations for the Holy Father’s dispensation. Why should she wait for a piece of parchment before having her desires gratified? As if to cut off the possibility of retreat (had she an inkling that her passion would be inconstant?), she wanted to give herself wholly to her lover without delay. Always in her resolves Mary showed this same blind disregard of consequences, this charming and foolish exaggeration. The faithful and adroit Rizzio soon found a way of gratifying the wishes of his royal mistress. He arranged for a Catholic priest to come to his room. Even though irrefutable evidence of a premature wedding be undiscoverable (as for all the details of Mary’s life, there is a conflict of testimony here), some sort of formal betrothal must have taken place. Why, otherwise, should the trusty henchman have exclaimed: “<i>Laudate sia Dio</i>”—Praised be God? Why should he have declared that no one could now “<i>disturbare le nozze</i>”—disturb the wedding? Long before any at court except Rizzio had taken Darnley’s wooing seriously, Mary’s cousin had become lord of her life and perhaps also of her body.
         </p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394714-00005">This “<i>matrimonio segreto</i>”—secret marriage—remained secret for a time because the pair chiefly concerned and also Rizzio and the priest knew how to hold their tongues. Still, the lovers’ manner betrayed them, as the heat of a hidden fire can be felt. It was not long before the court began to watch Mary Stuart and Darnley more closely. At this juncture the poor young fellow fell sick of measles—a distressingly childish ailment for a bridegroom. The anxious Mary watched day after day at his bedside and, when he was convalescent, continued to spend her time with him. The first among Mary’s statesmen and advisers to become seriously uneasy was James Stuart, Earl of Moray. Doubtless with a keen eye to his own advantage, he had honestly done his best to promote a good marriage for his sister and, although he was a strict Protestant, he had urged her to wed Don Carlos, scion of the Spanish Habsburgs, and therefore one of the leading figures in Catholic Christendom. But a wedding with Darnley ran athwart his plans and interests. Moray was clear-sighted enough to know that, should the conceited, soft-headed Darnley become prince consort, he would at once wish to wrest the royal authority into his own hands, and would never be content to let James Stuart rule. Besides, Moray had sufficient political flair to guess whither the intrigues of Rizzio, Italian secretary and papal agent, were tending—namely, towards the re-establishment of Catholicism and the downfall of the Reformation in Scotland. In his resolute mind personal ambition joined forces with religious conviction, the will-to-power with patriotic anxiety. He therefore urgently warned his sister against a marriage which would lead to disastrous conflict in a land that was just beginning to quiet down. When he saw that his warnings were unheeded, he abruptly left the court.
         </p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394714-00006">Lethington, the other trustworthy adviser, likewise offered resistance. He too saw that his position and the religious peace of Scotland were endangered. By degrees there assembled round the two Protestant statesmen the whole body of Scottish nobles that supported the Reformed Church. At length even Randolph, the English ambassador, began to notice what was going on at court. Afraid lest he should have been nodding at the decisive hour, in his report to Elizabeth he described handsome young Darnley’s influence with the Queen as the outcome of “witchcraft”, and began to drum lustily for aid. But the discontent and murmurings of these lesser folks were as nothing in comparison with the fury of Elizabeth when she learnt of Mary’s choice of husband. Now, indeed, she was distressingly repaid for the dubious game she had been playing; she had actually been made a fool of. While Mary was pretending to negotiate with her for her favourite Leicester, the real wooer had been smuggled out of her hands and across the border into Scotland; she was left stranded in London to reap the fruit of excess of diplomatic craft. In the first outburst of her anger, regarding Lady Lennox, Darnley’s mother, as at the bottom of the whole business, she caused the countess to be arrested and confined in the Tower. Threateningly she commanded Darnley, as one of her “subjects”, to return instantly to England; she alarmed his father with the threat of confiscating his estates; she summoned the Privy Council which, acting on her instructions, declared the marriage of Mary to Darnley “unmeet, unprofitable and perilous to the sincere amity between the queens and their realms”; she uttered veiled menaces of war. Substantially, however, she was so greatly alarmed and perplexed that simultaneously she tried chaffering. To save her own face, she played her last trump, the card which she had hitherto been careful to keep out of sight.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394714-00007">Now, when Elizabeth (though she does not yet know it) is too late in the field, for the first time she makes Mary an open and firm offer of succession to the English crown. Being in a great hurry, she sends a special envoy to convey the following declaration: “If the Queen of Scots would accept Leicester, she would be accounted and allowed next heir to the crown as though she were her own born daughter.” Here we have a signal instance of the futility of diplomacy. What Mary Stuart has for years been striving to attain with skill, urgency and cunning, that her rival should grant this right of succession to the English crown, is now put almost within her reach—would have been within her reach, had she not gone too far—by the most foolish action of her life.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394714-00008">It is part of the nature of political concessions that they come too late. Yesterday Mary Queen of Scots was still playing the political game; today she is only a woman, only a woman in love. Her leading ambition was, until a few weeks ago, to become acknowledged heiress to the throne of England. Now this desire for an enhanced royal state has been forgotten because of the woman’s impulsive longing to surrender her body to the embrace of a handsome young man. Even if she wanted to draw back, to secure the coveted prize in England, the secret marriage has made withdrawal out of the question. She and Darnley are man and wife, or at least formally betrothed. Too late come Elizabeth’s menaces; too late her offer of the English succession; too late, likewise, are the warnings of sincere friends, such as the Duke of Lorraine, her uncle, who urges Mary to have nothing more to do with that “<i>joli hutaudeau</i>”—that popinjay. Intelligence and reasons of state no longer weigh with the impetuous young woman.
         </p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394714-00009">Sarcastically she replied to the angry Elizabeth, who had been caught in her own net: “I am truly amazed at my good sister’s dissatisfaction, for the choice which she now blames was made in accordance with her wishes. I have rejected all foreign suitors, and have chosen an Englishman who is of the royal blood of both kingdoms, and, as far as England is concerned is, on his mother’s side, the eldest male descendant from the royal House of Tudor.” Elizabeth could not say a word to the contrary, for it was literally true that Mary had fulfilled her wishes, although after Mary’s own fashion! Mary had wedded an English nobleman, and one sent to her by Elizabeth, although the latter had an ambiguous intent. Elizabeth Tudor, her nerves distraught, nevertheless continued to overwhelm Mary Stuart with offers and threats. Thereupon Mary grew blunt. She denied any right on Elizabeth’s part to exercise “overlordship”, any grounds for interference. She herself, said Mary, had so long been “trayned with fayre speeches and beguyled in her expectations”, that she had at length made her own choice, with the full consent of her estates. Regardless of missives from London, whether sweet or sour, in Edinburgh Mary made speedy arrangements for a public marriage. Darnley was knighted, made Earl of Ross and granted other honours. The English envoy, who galloped up at the last minute carrying a pack of protests from England, arrived just in time to hear the proclamation that Henry Darnley was henceforward to be “namit and stylit king”.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394714-00010">Being already Duke of Albany, Darnley was proclaimed King of Scotland by Mary’s authority. On 29th July 1565, the nuptials of the pair were publicly celebrated in the Catholic chapel at Holyrood. To the general surprise, Mary Stuart, who always had an inventive turn where ceremonial was concerned, appeared in mourning dress, the robe she had worn at the interment of her first husband the King of France. She designed to show that she had not frivolously forgotten her first spouse, and now appeared a second time before the altar as wife in order to fulfil the wishes of her country. Not until after she had heard Mass and had withdrawn to her room did she allow herself to be persuaded by Darnley (though really all had been prearranged, and the festal robes were laid out ready) to doff her mourning and put on gay attire suitable to a bride. The palace was surrounded by a jubilant crowd. Largesse was freely scattered and the populace gave itself up to rejoicing—greatly to the annoyance of John Knox, who had himself just married a girl of eighteen as his second wife, but wished no one except himself to find enjoyment. In Knox’s despite, the rejoicings went on for four days and four nights, as though gloom were for ever to be dispelled from Scotland, and that misty land were to become a happy realm of youth.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394714-00011">Measureless was Elizabeth’s despair when she, unmarried and never to marry, learnt that Mary had for the second time become a wife. Her most artful manoeuvres had brought her only slaps in the face. She had offered the Queen of Scotland her own favourite as husband, and Leicester had been publicly refused. She had vetoed the wedding with Darnley, and her veto had been openly disregarded. She had dispatched a special envoy with a last warning, and he had been kept waiting outside barred gates until the marriage ceremony was over. It was essential for her now to do something to regain prestige. She must either break off diplomatic relations or declare war. But what pretext could she find for either step? Obviously Mary Stuart had the right to choose a husband for herself; she had complied with Elizabeth’s wish, since Elizabeth had disapproved of her wedding a foreign prince. There was no flaw in the marriage. Henry Darnley, great-grandson of Henry VII and chief male descendant of the House of Tudor, was worthy husband to a queen. He was co-heir presumptive to the English crown, and Mary’s marriage to him greatly strengthened her claim to the English succession. Any further protest on Elizabeth’s part would only make her private spleen manifest to the world.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394714-00012">Throughout Elizabeth’s life, however, ambiguity remained one of her chief characteristics. Although in this instance its result had been so unfortunate, she could not desist from it. Naturally she did not declare war on Mary Stuart; she did not recall her ambassador but, by underground ways, she did everything she could to make things uncomfortable for those whom she did not wish to be a happy wedded pair. Too timid, too cautious, to come into the open against Darnley and Mary Stuart, she intrigued against them behind the scenes. Rebels and malcontents were never difficult to find in the Scotland of those days when it was a question of running counter to the established authorities, and on this occasion there was forthcoming a man who stood head and shoulders in energy and wrath above all the petty rabble of the disgruntled. Moray had been conspicuous by his absence from his sister’s wedding, and his non-attendance was regarded as an evil omen. For Moray (this is what makes his figure so mysteriously attractive) had an extraordinary instinct for detecting the onset of changes in the political weather and an incredibly keen capacity at forecasting; he always knew where the danger points were to be found, and on this occasion he did the cleverest thing a politician of his stamp can do—he vanished. Having dropped the helm of state, he became invisible and undiscoverable. Like the drying-up of springs, the failure of rivers to flow, great natural catastrophes, the disappearance of Moray—as we shall see again and again in the history of Mary Stuart—always foreboded political disaster. For the time, however, he remained passive. During the days when the wedding was being celebrated he stayed at his castle, having quietly withdrawn from the court, wishing to show in a loyal and yet unmistakable manner that, as first minister of state and protector of Protestantism, he disapproved of the choice of Henry Darnley as King of Scotland. Elizabeth, however, wanted something more than this passive protest against the new royal pair. She desired open rebellion, was eager that Mary Stuart should pay for her private happiness with political trouble and, keeping this end in view, the Queen of England sought the favour of Moray and of the no less discontented Hamiltons. She herself must, on no account, be compromised. “In the most secret way”, therefore, she commissioned Bedford, one of her agents, to support Moray and Hamilton with troops and money “as if from himself”, and with the implication that Elizabeth knew nothing of the matter. The money fell into the clutching hands of the Scottish lords like dew upon a parched meadow; they rallied their courage, and the pledges of military aid soon brought about the rebellion England desired.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394714-00013">It was, perhaps, the only mistake made by the shrewd and far-seeing Moray that he should rely upon the English Queen, who was so utterly unreliable, and should put himself at the head of this insurrection. Being cautious, indeed, he did not start proceedings at once, and was content for the time being to find secret confederates, for he really wanted to wait until Elizabeth would openly espouse the cause of the Protestant lords, so that he could take the field against his sister, not as an ordinary rebel, but as defender of the threatened Church. Mary, on the other hand, disquieted by her brother’s ambiguous conduct, and rightly unwilling to tolerate a holding aloof that was manifestly hostile, formally summoned him to appear before parliament and justify his conduct. Moray, however, as proud as his sister, would not present himself in the character of an accused person. He haughtily refused to comply, with the result that he and his adherents were “put to the horn” in Edinburgh marketplace, that is they were publicly declared outlaws. Once more, arms were to decide instead of reason.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394714-00014">On this occasion, however, the temperamental difference between Mary Stuart and Elizabeth Tudor was signally disclosed once more. Mary showed herself prompter to act and far more resolute, her courage being always impatient, swift and impetuous. Elizabeth, on the other hand, acting timidly as was her wont, hesitated too long. Before she had made up her mind to instruct her treasurer to equip an army and openly to support the insurgents, Mary had taken action. She issued a proclamation in which she dealt roundly with the rebels. “You are not satisfied to heap wealth upon wealth, honours upon honours, you want to have ourselves and our kingdom altogether in your hands that you may deal with them as you will, and compel them to act wholly in accordance with your desire—in a word, you want to be kings yourselves, and leave us nothing more than the nominal title of ruler of the kingdom.” Without losing an hour, the intrepid woman mounted her horse and, armed with pistols, her young husband wearing gilt armour riding by her side, surrounded by those of the nobles who had remained true to her, she set forth against the rebels at the head of a quickly assembled army. The wedding march had become a war march. This resoluteness was justified by the result. Most of the opposing barons were daunted by the display of royal energy—all the more seeing that the promised aid from England was not forthcoming, and Elizabeth continued to send dubious words instead of an army. One after another, with hanging heads, they returned to pay allegiance to their rightful ruler. Moray alone remained stout-hearted, but before he, forsaken by his allies, could gather a new army, he was a defeated man and had to flee. The victorious royal pair followed him hot-foot, so that it was only by the skin of his teeth that he saved himself on 14th October 1565, through crossing the border onto English soil.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394714-00015">Mary’s victory was complete. All the peers of the Scottish realm now formed a solid front round Mary Stuart; once more Scotland was in the hands of a king and a queen. For a moment Mary’s confidence was so overwhelming that she was minded to take the offensive and cross the border into England, where she knew that the Catholic minority would welcome her as a deliverer. The more prudent among her advisers were able, with some difficulty, to hold this impulse in check. In any case, now that Elizabeth had put her cards on the table, the days of an exchange of courtesies between the cousins were over. The independent choice of a husband had been Mary’s first triumph over Elizabeth; the crushing of the rebellion was the second; henceforward she could look freely and proudly across the border and stare her “good sister” out of countenance.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394714-00016">Before these troubles had arisen, Elizabeth’s position had been far from enviable. Now, after the defeat of the Scottish rebels whose movement she had fomented, that position became alarming. Doubtless it has at all times been an international custom for rulers who have secretly instigated revolts in neighbouring lands to disavow the rebels when these are conquered. But since misfortunes never come singly, one of Elizabeth’s consignments of money to the Scottish lords had chanced to fall into the hands of Bothwell, Moray’s deadly enemy, when making a raid, so that plain proofs of the complicity of the Queen of England had been secured. A second grave inconvenience was caused by the fact that Moray, almost as a matter of course, had taken refuge in England, the country which had given him both open and tacit support. Nay, more, the defeated man actually put in an appearance in London. This was most embarrassing for the English ruler, accustomed though she was to play a double game! If she received Moray, the rebel, at court, this would imply that she approved or at least condoned his rebellion against Mary. If, on the other hand, she were to shame her secret ally by refusing him an audience, the affront might lead him to let the cat out of the bag, to explain to foreign courts that he had been Elizabeth’s pensioner. Scarcely on any other occasion did Elizabeth’s habit of playing double put her in a tighter place than this.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394714-00017">Fortunately, however, the sixteenth century was one when many notable comedies were composed. Elizabeth had the advantage of breathing the same vital atmosphere that Shakespeare and Ben Jonson were to breathe. A born actress, she could play her part as well as any queen of the stage; so that high comedy was already as much in vogue at Hampton Court and Westminster as later in the Globe or the Fortune Theatre. Hardly had she been informed of the arrival of her inconvenient ally, when she arranged for Cecil, the same evening, to put Moray through a sort of dress rehearsal of the part it would be incumbent upon him to play in order to save Queen Elizabeth’s honour.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394714-00018">It would be hard for a dramatist to imagine anything more impudent than the comedy that was staged next morning. The French ambassador came to pay his respects, talking of this, that and the other, for how could he dream that he had been summoned to look on at an impudent farce? While he was discussing the political situation, a lackey entered and announced the Earl of Moray. The Queen knitted her brows. Who? Had she not misheard the name? Really, the Earl of Moray? How could this base rebel against her “good sister” have made his way to London? What unheard-of insolence for him to demand audience of her, whom all the world knew to be devoted to her Scottish cousin! Poor Elizabeth! At first, she could hardly contain her astonishment and indignation. Still, after brief and gloomy reflection, she made up her mind to receive the “scoundrel” but, God be praised, she need not see him alone! She begged the French ambassador to be good enough to remain as witness of her “honest” indignation.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394714-00019">Now it was Moray’s turn to play up. He did so with all due seriousness. His aspect as he entered was designed to show contrition and a sense of guilt. Humbly and timidly, with a mien altogether different from his customary stride, did he enter the room. He was clad in black, kneeled before Elizabeth, and began to address her in his native Doric. The Queen promptly interrupted him, commanding him to speak French, so that the ambassador could follow their conversation and no one would be able to say she had talked secrets with so opprobrious a rebel. Moray stammered a little, in assumed embarrassment, but Elizabeth went on, taking a high tone. She could not understand how he, a refugee who had been rebelling against her cousin and friend, dared to enter her court uninvited. There had, no doubt, been various misunderstandings between herself and Mary Stuart, but none of them had been serious. She, Elizabeth, had always regarded the Queen of Scotland as her good sister, and hoped that the pair of them would ever remain upon such excellent terms. Unless Moray satisfactorily proved that only in a moment of folly or in self-defence had he taken up arms against his lawful sovereign, Elizabeth would have him arrested, and would call him to account for his rebellious behaviour. Moray would do well to excuse himself as best he could.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394714-00020">Moray, having been carefully drilled by Cecil, knew that now he might say anything in the world except the truth. He knew that he must take all the blame upon himself, in order to exonerate Elizabeth in the ambassador’s eyes. Instead, therefore, of stating his grievances against Mary Stuart, he praised his half-sister to the skies. She had bestowed upon him lands, titles of honour and other rewards far beyond his merits; he had, for that reason, served her faithfully, and nothing but the dread of a conspiracy against his own person, nothing but the fear of assassination, had led him to behave as foolishly, as recklessly, as he had done. He had only come to Elizabeth hoping for her gracious help to induce the Queen of Scotland to forgive him.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394714-00021">This seemed already to exculpate very efficiently the woman who had fomented the whole affair. But Elizabeth needed more. The comedy had been staged, not merely that Moray, before the French ambassador, should take the blame on his own shoulders, but that, as witness for the crown, he might declare that Elizabeth had had nothing whatever to do with the affair. A thumping lie never means any more to a politician than empty breath, so Moray solemnly assured the ambassador that Queen Elizabeth “had known nothing whatever about the conspiracy, and had never encouraged him or his friends to disobey the orders of their lawful sovereign.”</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394714-00022">Elizabeth had got what she wanted. She had been solemnly whitewashed, and was able, with theatrical emotion, to rail at her fellow conspirator in front of the ambassador. “Now,” she exclaimed, “ye have told the truth; for neither did I, nor any in my name, stir ye up against your Queen, for your abominable treason might serve for example to move my own subjects to rebel against me; therefore pack you out of my presence, ye are but an unworthy traitor.” Moray bowed his head, perhaps to conceal a smile. He had not forgotten the many thousand pounds which, in the Queen’s name, had been handed to Lady Moray for him, and to some of the other rebel lords; nor had he forgotten Randolph’s imploring letters, nor yet the pledges of English military aid. He knew, moreover, that if for the time being he were prepared to accept the role of scapegoat, Elizabeth would not chase him forth into the desert. The French ambassador, meanwhile, stood respectfully listening and watching, for being a man of education he could enjoy a good comedy. Not until he got back to the embassy would he allow himself to smile, when sitting alone at his desk and writing a report to his royal master. Elizabeth, one may suppose, was not altogether happy in her mind, for she can hardly have believed that anyone could have taken these assurances at their face value. Still, no one had ventured to smile openly. Appearances had been kept up, and what did truth matter? Without a word more, sustained by the dignity of her voluminous skirts, she rustled out.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394714-00023">Nothing can show better how great, for the time, had become the power of Mary Stuart, than that her English cousin and adversary should, after losing the battle, have been driven to such petty subterfuges in order to make a seemly retreat. The Queen of Scotland could raise her head proudly, for everything had happened as she had willed. The man of her choice wore the Scottish crown; the barons who had risen against her had returned to their allegiance or were outlawed in foreign lands. All the omens were favourable, and when she now bore a son to her young husband, the last and greatest of her dreams was fulfilled. This Stuart boy would be King of the united thrones of Scotland and England.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394714-00024">The omens were favourable. Fortunate stars shed their light like a silent blessing over the land. Now, one might suppose, Mary Stuart could rest in the enjoyment of the happiness she had harvested. But the law of her unruly nature was to suffer storm or to raise it. One whose heart is untamed cannot rest content when the outer world proffers happiness and peace. Impetuously this disorderly heart continued, from within, to create fresh disasters and new perils.</p>
