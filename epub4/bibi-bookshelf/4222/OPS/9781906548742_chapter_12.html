Yet there is no conflict of testimony as to the journey she made to Glasgow to visit her ailing husband when the conspiracy to murder him was in full swing. It is one of the most incontestable actions of her life. Here, as so often, arises the question whether Mary Queen of Scots was really an Atrides figure, was, like Clytemnestra, able with well-feigned wifely care to make ready the bath for her husband on his return from Troy, while Ægisthus, her paramour, with whom she had planned the murder of Agamemnon, was waiting in the shadow with the sharpened axe. Was she a second Lady Macbeth, who with gentle and flattering words led King Duncan to the bedroom in which Macbeth was to slay him? Was she one of those fiendish criminals whom the unruly passion of love will often produce out of women who have been devoted wives? Or was she a mere tool in the hands of the brutal bully Bothwell, unconsciously (in a trance, as it were) obeying an irresistible command; a puppet, unaware of the preparations that were being made for the dreadful deed? Modern sentiment rises in revolt against the theory that she was a deliberate criminal, that a woman who had previously shown herself animated with humane sentiments could have been party to the butchering of her husband. Repeated attempts have been made, and will still be made, to put another, a kindlier interpretation upon her journey to Glasgow. Again and again one tries to regard as untrustworthy the utterances and documents which incriminate her. One scrutinises the Casket Letters, the verses, the sworn testimony, in the honest hope of convincing oneself that the exculpations devised by Mary’s defenders are satisfactory. In vain! With the best will in the world to believe them, we find that these special pleadings have no convincing force. The more closely we scrutinise the exonerations, the more futile do they seem when confronted with the iron chain of fact.
         </p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394719-00001">How can anyone imagine that loving care impelled Mary to seek out her husband on his sickbed that she might withdraw him from a safe refuge in order to have him better tended at home? For months the wedded couple had lived apart. Darnley had been “in a manner exiled from her presence” … though “with all humilitie he requiryth hir favour, to be admitted to hir bed as hir husband.” She bluntly refused to allow him his conjugal rights, and there is ample evidence that such conversations as she had of late had with Darnley were disfigured by hatred and contentions. The Spanish, the English and the French ambassadors write at great length in their reports about the estrangement as insuperable, inalterable, a thing which must be taken as a matter of course. The Scottish lords had publicly advocated a divorce and yet more forcible means of solving the difficulty. So indifferent had the pair become to one another that, when Darnley received tidings that Mary lay dangerously ill in Jedburgh, and that the last sacrament had been administered, he made no immediate move to visit her. Not even with a microscope can the observer find any intact filaments of love in this marriage at the stage the rupture had now reached. Tenderness was over and done with. Preposterous, therefore, is the assumption that loving care instigated Mary’s journey to Glasgow.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394719-00002">Still, we have to consider the last argument of those who wish to defend the Queen through thick and thin. Perhaps her journey was designed to put an end to the breach between herself and her husband? Perhaps she visited him in order to become reconciled to him? Unfortunately even this last straw breaks in the hands of her uncompromising defenders; or, rather, it is broken by a document in her own writing. Only one day before she set out for Glasgow, in a missive to Archbishop Beaton, she unreflectingly (for Mary Stuart never dreamt that her letters would continue to testify against her long after she was dead) gave vent to the most acrimonious utterances concerning Darnley.</p> 
         <div class="block extract" id="rw-block-extract_394719-00001">
            <p id="rw-p_394719-00003"><i>And for the King our husband, God knows always our past towards him, and his behaviour and thankfulness to us is likewise well known to God and the world. Always we perceive him occupied and busy enough to have inquisition of our doings which, God willing, shall aye be such as none shall have occasion to be offended with them, or to report of us in any ways but honourably, howsoever he, his father and their abettors seek, which we know was no good will to make us have ado, if their power were equivalent to their mind—but God moderates their forces well enough, and takes the means of execution from them; for, as we believe, they shall find none, or very few, approvers of their counsels or devices imagined to our displeasure.</i>
            </p>
         </div> 
         <p class="fp" id="rw-p_394719-00004">Is that the voice of reconciliation? Are those the sentiments of a loving wife who, full of distress, is hastening to her sick husband’s bedside? But here is another incriminating circumstance. Mary undertook the journey, not simply to visit Darn-ley and come home again, but with the fixed intent of having him conveyed forthwith to Edinburgh. Surely this was excess of zeal? Was it not contrary to the rules of medical art and the prescriptions of reason to take a man not yet convalescent from smallpox out of his bed in midwinter, and to convey him on a two-day journey in a litter? In her “loving care” for him she intended to carry him off in this way, as is shown by her having brought a litter along with her, that Darnley might have no cause for objection to the removal, and could be transported as soon as possible to Edinburgh, where the conspiracy to get rid of him was in active progress.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394719-00005">Still, lest we should unjustly accuse a fellow mortal of murder, let us ask whether there can be found any justification for her defenders’ contention that she was not privy to the conspiracy. Unfortunately there is extant a letter sent by Archibald Douglas which effectually disposes of this hypothesis. Unless she had forcibly closed her eyes to what was going on, she could not fail to be aware of it. She knew that the pardoned lords were deadly enemies of Darnley and that they had sworn vengeance against him. They had shown her the bond in which Darn-ley pledged himself to join them in Rizzio’s murder. Furthermore, Lethington told her that means would be found, without tarnishing her honour, to free her from the “proud fool and bloody tiranne”. The aforesaid letter shows that Archibald Douglas, the chief agent of the conspirators, sought Mary out on her journey to secure her plain assent to the plot for Darnley’s assassination. Even if we may suppose that she refused such assent, and declined to be a party to the affair, what are we to think of a wife who keeps silent when she has been informed that her husband’s murder is being planned? Why did she not warn Darnley? Why, above all, though she must now have been convinced that his enemies intended to slay him, did she bring him back into the region where his murder would be comparatively easy? In such circumstances silence is something more than mere complicity; it is the tendering of secret aid, for one who is informed of a conspiracy and does not try to prevent its being carried out is at least guilty of failure to intervene.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394719-00006">No unprejudiced investigator can fail to recognise Mary’s complicity in her husband’s murder. However, if this complicity was a crime, it was a “<i>crime passionnel</i>”—one of those terrible actions for which not the individual but his passion is responsible, at a time when passion has full sway.
         </p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394719-00007">One who wishes to plead extenuating circumstances can only do so on the ground of “diminished responsibility” through passion, and not on the ground that she knew nothing of the matter. She was not acting boldly, joyfully, in full awareness, and under the promptings of her own will, but at the instigation of an alien will. I do not think it can be justly said that Mary went to Glasgow in a spirit of cold calculation in order to bring Darnley back into the danger zone; for, in the decisive hour (as the Casket Letters prove), she was filled with repulsion and horror at the thought of the role which was imposed on her. Doubtless she had beforehand talked over with Bothwell the plan of removing Darnley to Edinburgh, but one of her letters shows with remarkable clearness how, as soon as she was a day’s journey away from her controller, and thus partially freed from the hypnotic influence he exercised upon her, the slumbering conscience of this <i>magna peccatrix</i> began to stir. We must draw a clear distinction between her, as one of those who are driven into crime by mysterious forces, and those who are criminals through and through; for at the moment when Mary began the actual carrying out of the plan, when she found herself face to face with the victim whom she was to lead to the slaughter, she was no longer inspired by hatred or by vengeful sentiments, and her innate humanity struggled desperately against the inhumanity of her commission. At the moment of the crime, and even when she was engaged in transferring Darnley to the place of assassination, the true womanliness of her nature surged up. But this revulsion of feeling came too late. In the Kirk o’ Field affair, Mary was not only the huntress cunningly seeking her prey; she herself was also the quarry. Behind her she could hear the crack of the huntsman’s whip. She trembled at the thought of the bullying wrath of her lover Bothwell should she fail to lead the victim to the sacrifice, and she trembled, likewise, lest through weakness she should forfeit the arl’s love. Only on the ground that Mary was suffering from a paralysis of the will, and did not at the bottom of her soul will her own deed, only when we recognise that she was inwardly in revolt against the actions that were forced upon her, can we at least sympathetically understand a deed which, from the outlook of abstract justice, was unpardonable.
         </p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394719-00008">We can understand the gruesome story of those hours only in the light of the famous letter which she wrote to Bothwell from the ailing Darnley’s bedside; nothing but this missive gives the repulsive deed a reconciling glimmer of humanity. The letter, as it were, removes a wall to give us a glimpse into the dreadful hours in Glasgow. It is long past midnight. Mary Stuart is seated at the writing table in a strange room. A fire flickers on the hearth, throwing shadows on the lofty walls. This fire does not warm either the lonely room or the woman’s freezing soul. Again and again a shudder runs down her back. She is tired, would gladly sleep, but cannot do so owing to the way her mind is worked up. She has lived through too much during these last weeks, during these last hours. Her nerves are still tingling with excitement. Horrified at the thought of the deed about to be committed, but blindly obedient to the behests of the man who has mastered her will, as Bothwell’s slave she has undertaken this evil journey in order to remove her husband from safety to certain death.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394719-00009">She has not found her task easy, so far. At the door of the house she was stopped by a messenger from Lennox, Darnley’s father. The old man had had his suspicions aroused. Why should his son’s wife, who had sedulously avoided her husband for months, and had obviously come to hate him, hasten in this way to his bedside now that he had fallen sick? Old men are ready to forebode evil, and perhaps Lennox called to mind that, whenever Mary Stuart, since Rizzio’s murder, had shown any kindliness towards her husband, it had been in pursuit of personal advantage. However, she managed to satisfy the emissary and was admitted to Darnley’s bedroom. Like Lennox, the young man was mistrustful, remembering how often she had played tricks on him. The first thing he wanted to know was why she had brought a litter along. In face of such questions, it needed all her presence of mind lest, by a stammer, by a blush or by pallor, she should betray herself. Still, dread of Bothwell quickened her powers in the art of deception. With fondling hands, with consoling words, she at length put Darnley’s suspicions to sleep. Thus she undermined his will, made him her pliant tool. Already on the first afternoon, half the work had been done.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394719-00010">Now she was alone with him in the small hours. The candles flickered in ghostly fashion, and so silent was the room that she was afraid her thoughts would become audible, and the sighs of her uneasy conscience. She could not sleep; she could not rest; she felt an irresistible longing to confide to someone the troubles that burdened her spirit, to pour out in words the anguish of her soul. But Bothwell, the only man on earth to whom she could speak about these things, was far away. So secret were they that she was afraid to admit them even to herself. Still, as a relief, she began to commit her thoughts to paper, in a letter to her lover, a long, rambling letter. She would not finish it that night, nor yet the next day, nor yet the night following; for it was really a dialogue with herself. In the act of committing a crime, the criminal was wrestling with her conscience. It was the expression of intense fatigue, of the uttermost confusion. Words of folly and words of profound significance, laments and idle chatter and despairing complaints, succeed one another pell-mell. We have a vision of black thoughts fluttering through the darkness like bats. Hatred flames up between the lines; compassion overcomes it for a moment, but the dominant note is one of ardent love for him who has mastered her will and whose hand has thrust her into this abyss. Her letter paper has come to an end, so she goes on writing on the back of the pages of a memorial—on, on, on, for she feels that horror will choke her unless she continues to pour out words to the man now linked to her in the bonds of crime as well as in the bonds of love.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394719-00011">But while the pen between her trembling fingers seemed to move of its own volition over the paper, she noticed that she lacked power to say what she wanted to say, to bridle, to arrange her thoughts. What she inscribed on these sheets seemed to her to well up from unknown depths of her mind, so that she excused herself for incoherence and begged Bothwell to read the letter twice over. This is what makes the epistle of three thousand words so unique a human document, that it is not written alertly and clearly, but confusedly and stumblingly. It is not Mary’s conscious mind that is speaking, so much as an inner self, the voice of trance and fatigue and fever—the subconsciousness with which it is so hard to get into touch, the realm of feeling that knows no shame. Overtones and undertones, clear ideas and such as would never be expressed by one with full awareness, are mingled in this document written by one who had temporarily lost the power of self-concentration. She repeats herself, contradicts herself, gives vent to a flow of jumbled thoughts in the extremity of her passion. Very few documents have been preserved that reveal so admirably as this the hyperexcitability of one who is in the course of committing a crime. No Buchanan and no Lethington, no one with an ordinary though shrewd intelligence could, for all his culture and ability, have imagined with such magical faithfulness the hallucinated monologue of a profoundly troubled heart; could have imagined the desperate situation of the woman who, while the deed is in full progress, finds no other escape from pricks of conscience than in writing to her lover; who writes in search of forgetfulness, of self-exculpation; who takes refuge in writing to dull, in the quiet of the night, the sound of the monitory beating of her own heart. Once more we cannot but think of Lady Macbeth, wandering by night through the dark corridors of Dunsinane Castle, assailed by dreadful memories and, in the monologue of a sleepwalker, recounting the incidents of her crime. None but a Shakespeare or a Dostoevsky could have imagined such a scene; none but they, or their master, Reality. (The French original having been destroyed, the quotations from the second letter to Bothwell that follow are taken from an English translation.)</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394719-00012">“I am weary, and am a sleepe, and yet I cannot forbeare scribbling so long as ther is any paper … Excuse it, yf I write yll; you must gesse the one halfe; but I am glad to write unto you when other folkes be a sleepe, seeing that I cannot doo as they doo, according to my desyre, that is betwene your armes my dear lyfe.” With overwhelming impressiveness she describes how delighted Darnley has been by her unexpected coming. One can fancy oneself looking at the poor youth, his face flushed with fever, and still disfigured by the eruption. He has been alone, languishing for a sight of his fair young wife. Now, of a sudden, he finds her sitting by his bedside. “He said that he did dreme, and that he was so glad to see me that he thought he shuld dye.” Again and again, indeed, the old suspicions flame up in him. Her coming seems incredible, but he has been too sore at heart, and is now too glad to see her to dwell on the possibility of further deception, often though she has deceived him. It is sweet for a man who is weak and ill to believe in loving assurances, so easy to persuade a vain man that he is loved. Ere long Darnley was once more her slave, just as he had become during the night after Rizzio’s murder, and he begged her forgiveness for everything he might have done to displease her.</p>

            </p>
         </div> 
         <p class="fp" id="rw-p_394719-00014">Once more we look through this letter into the shadowy room that is so distant both in time and space. We picture Mary Stuart sitting by the sick man’s bed and listening to this outburst of love and humility. Now she ought to rejoice, for her scheme has been successful; she has once more made the simple-minded lad soft and yielding. But she is too much ashamed of her deceit to rejoice. At the climax of her success she is overcome with loathing as she contemplates her own deed. Gloomily, with averted eyes, with disordered senses, she sits beside her husband, so that even Darnley is at length struck by something obscure, something incomprehensible, in this beloved woman. The poor dupe tries to console the deceiver! He wants to help her, to cheer her up, to make her happy. He implores her to stay the night in his room, dreaming, poor fool, once more of love and tenderness. It is heartbreaking to a reader of this letter to note how the weakling again clung trustfully to his wife, again felt sure of her. He could not turn away his eyes from her, or cease from enjoying the delight of renewed confidential association from which he had so long been debarred. He begged her to cut up his meat for him. In his folly, he blurted out secret after secret, revealing the names of those whom he had been employing to spy upon her. Not knowing of her passion for Bothwell, he told her of his own fierce hatred of Bothwell and Lethington.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394719-00015">Naturally enough, the more he gave himself away, the harder he made it for his wife to betray him, unsuspecting and helpless. Despite herself, she was touched by the credulity of her victim. She found it difficult to go on playing this despicable comedy. “You have never heard him speake better nor more humbly; and if I had not proofe of his hart to be as waxe and if myne were not as a dyamant, no stroke but coming from your hands could make me but to have pitie of him.” We see that she no longer hated Darnley, that she had forgotten all the ill the poor deceitful creature had done her. At the bottom of her soul she would gladly have spared him. She shifted the burden of vengeance onto Bothwell’s shoulders. “You are the cause thereof. For, my own revenge, I wold not doo it.” It is Bothwell’s command, which she must obey in defiance of her conscience. For love’s sake, and for no other reason, she must do this horrible thing, must turn the childlike trust of her husband to account. She burst out angrily: “You make me dissemble so much that I am afrayde thereof with horrour, and you make me almost to play the part of a traitor. Remember that if it weare not for obeyeng I had rather be dead. My heart bleedith for yt.”</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394719-00016">But a thrall cannot defy orders. He can but groan when the lash drives him forward. Once more she insists that what she does is done by Bothwell’s will and not her own: “Alas! and I never deceived anybody; but I remitt myself wholly to your will. And send me word what I shall doo, and whatsoever happen to me, I will obey you. Think also yf you will not fynd som invention more secret by phisick, for he is to take physick at Cragmillar and the bathes also.”</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394719-00017">We see that she would at any rate be glad to secure an easier death for her unhappy husband, and to avoid the gross act of violence that had been planned. Had she not become so completely subordinate to Bothwell, had there still remained in her a spark of moral independence, she would, even at this late hour, one feels, have saved Darnley. But she will not venture on disobedience, being afraid that this will cost her Bothwell, whose wishes she has pledged herself to carry out; and also afraid (this is a brilliant flash of psychological insight, which no forger could have imagined) that Bothwell would, in the end, despise her for having shown compassion. “I shall never be willing to beguile one that puttith his trust in me. Nevertheless you may doo all, and doo not estyme me the lesse therefor, for you are the cause thereof.” She flings herself, figuratively, on her knees before him in a last despairing appeal that he will reward by his love the torment that she is now suffering for his sake.</p> 
         <div class="block extract" id="rw-block-extract_394719-00003">
            <p id="rw-p_394719-00018"><i>Now if to please you, my deere lyfe, I spare neither honor, conscience, nor hazard, nor greatnes, take it in good part, and not according to the interpretation of your false brother-in-law, to whom I pray you, give no credit against the most faythfull lover that ever you had or shall have. See not also her [the Countess of Bothwell] whose faynid teares you ought not more to regarde than the true travails which I endure to deserve her place, for obteyning of which, against my own nature, I doo betray those that could lett me. God forgive me, and give you, my only frend, the good luck and prosperitie that your humble and faythfull lover doth wisshe vnto you, who hopeth shortly to be an other thing vnto you, for the reward of my paynes.</i>

         </div> 
         <p class="fp" id="rw-fp_394719-00002">One who listens to the unhappy woman’s tortured heart speaking out of this letter will not term her a murderess, although throughout these days and nights she was serving the cause of murder. We feel, as we read, that her reluctance is really stronger than her will. We feel that her honest spirit has been besmirched by these deceptions; perhaps during many of these hours she was much nearer suicide than murder. But herein lies the disaster of such subjection as hers. One who has surrendered his will to another’s keeping can no longer choose his own path; he can only serve and obey. She therefore stumbled onward, bondmaid of her passion, unwitting and yet at the same time cruelly aware, towards the abyss of her deed.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394719-00019">On the second day Mary Stuart made the prescribed arrangements; the more subtle, the more dangerous part of the scheme had been carried through. She had allayed the suspicions in Darnley’s mind, so that the ailing, stupid youth was now “the merriest that ever you saw”. Though still feeble, still disfigured by the marks of the recent smallpox, he ventured on little endearments. He tried to kiss her, to put his arms round her, and she found it hard to conceal her disgust and impatience. Obedient to Mary’s wishes, as obedient as she was to Bothwell’s commands, this thrall of a thrall declared himself ready to return with her to Edinburgh. Trustfully he allowed himself to be carried out of his safe retreat and installed in the litter, his face wrapped in a linen cloth to hide its disfigurement. Now the victim was on the way to the slaughterhouse, and Mary had fulfilled her cruel task. The rough and bloody deed was to be Bothwell’s affair, and that harsh borderer would find it a thousand times easier than Mary Stuart had found the preceding acts of deception.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394719-00020">The litter advanced slowly, accompanied by a guard of riders, along the wintry road. The royal pair, seemingly reconciled after months of severance and dissension, were returning to Edinburgh. Edinburgh? Yes, but where in Edinburgh? To Holyrood Palace, one might suppose, the royal residence, a comfortable abode. No, Bothwell, the all-powerful, had made other arrangements. The King should not return to his own home at Holyrood, for there might still be danger of his spreading the infection. Why not, then, send him to Stirling, or to Edinburgh Castle, an impregnable fortress, or house him as guest in some other princely dwelling, or perhaps in the episcopal palace? No, and yet again no! Strangely enough there was chosen for his residence a modest and isolated building that no one would have dreamt of; not a princely habitation at all, but a house “in a solitar place at the outmost part of ye town, separat from all companie—ane maist rewynous hous quhair no man had dwelt seven yearis of befoir”—a house hard to watch and to protect. One cannot but ask who had chosen for the King this suspiciously remote house in Kirk o’ Field, to which the approach was by an alley bearing the ominous name of Thieves’ Row. Bothwell had chosen it, Bothwell who was now “all in all”. Again and again one comes across the same red thread in the labyrinth. Again and again, in letters, documents and utterances, the trace of blood leads us back to this sinister figure.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394719-00021">A small habitation, unworthy of a king, it lay among untilled fields, the nearest adjoining residence being that of one of Bothwell’s henchmen. It contained no more than an anteroom and four rooms. On the ground floor a bedroom was made ready for the Queen, who now expressed a strong desire to care tenderly for the husband she had of late neglected. One of the rooms on the upper storey was set in order for the King, and the other of the two first-floor rooms was allotted to his three serving men. Certainly the place was richly furnished for the occasion, carpets and tapestries being brought from Holy-rood, and one of the fine beds which Mary of Guise had imported from France. Another of these beds was supplied for the Queen’s bedroom.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394719-00022">Now Mary could not do enough to display her affection for Darnley. Though she slept only two nights in the Kirk o’ Field house, she came over frequently to companion him, attended by her train—and we must not forget that for months before this she had sedulously avoided him. The nights she slept in the room under Darnley’s were probably the fifth and seventh of February. Everyone in Edinburgh was to know that the King and the Queen were once more a loving couple, the reconciliation being thus advertised to the world. This change of mood must have produced a strange impression upon the Scottish lords who, only a few days before, had discussed with the Queen the removal of Darnley by all possible means. Now had come this overemphasised affection! The ablest of the nobles, Moray, was quick to draw his conclusions. He did not doubt for a moment that, in the sequestered house, evil was to befall the King of Scotland, and diplomatically he made his preparations.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394719-00023">Perhaps there was only one person in Scotland who honestly believed in Mary’s change of heart—Darnley himself, the unhappy husband. His vanity was tickled by the attention she paid him; he was proud to find that the Scottish lords, who for so long had treated him with contempt, now visited him in his sickbed making low obeisances and showing concern in their faces. In a letter to his father, dated 7th February, he assured Lennox how rapidly his health was improving under “the loving care of my love the Queen, who doth use herself like a natural and loving wife.” Within a few days the last traces of the dreaded and usually disfiguring disease had disappeared. His doctors had assured him of this, and that he would be able to remove to his palace. The horses had been ordered for next Monday. Another day, and he would be back in Holyrood, to share bed and board with his wife and, once more, to be King in his own country and lord of his wife’s heart.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394719-00024">But before this Monday, 10th February, came Sunday, 9th February 1567, and that evening high festival was to be held in Holyrood. Two of Queen Mary’s most faithful servants were to be married; there were to be a banquet and a dance, at which the Queen had promised to appear with her ladies. But this manifest affair was not to be the main event of the day. There was something else in the wind, as time would show. On Sunday morning, the Earl of Moray took leave of his sister for several days, ostensibly to visit his wife, who was lying ill at one of his castles. This departure was a bad sign. Whenever Moray suddenly withdrew from the political scene, he had good reason for the step. Always his disappearance foreshadowed a rising or some other misfortune, and always on his return he was able to produce an alibi, to show that he had had nothing to do with the affair, although he would not fail to reap any advantages that were derivable from it. Not a year had elapsed since, on the morning after the murder of Rizzio, he had ridden into Edinburgh as innocently as he was now riding away from it the morning before a still more horrible crime was to be perpetrated, leaving to others the deed and the danger, while intending to garner the honour and the profit.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394719-00025">Something else happened which might have given reason for thought. We learn that Mary had already issued orders for the removal of her costly bed with its fur covering from her bedroom in Kirk o’ Field back to Holyrood. This seemed natural enough, since she proposed to sleep in Holyrood that night, and not in Kirk o’ Field; the next day there would be an end to the separation. Yes, that is a natural way of accounting for the order, but subsequent events were to throw an ominous light upon the removal of the costly bed on this particular day. At the time, however, neither in the afternoon nor in the evening of Sunday were there signs that anything was amiss, and the Queen’s behaviour was as ordinary as possible. During the day, accompanied by her friends, she visited her husband, now almost recovered. In the evening she sat with Bothwell, Huntly and Argyll among the wedding company and made merry with them. Still, once again, after night had fallen, though it was cold and wintry, she visited the forsaken house in Kirk o’ Field to see Darnley. What a touching demonstration! She bade farewell to the festal party at Holyrood, merely that she might sit a little longer with her husband and converse with him. She stayed at Kirk o’ Field until eleven. Let the reader carefully note the hour. Then she returned to Holyrood on horseback, well attended, the little procession being made conspicuous by the torches that were carried to light it on its way. The doors of the palace were opened wide, for Edinburgh was to see that the Queen had returned from her loving visit to her husband, was to hear the skirl of the bagpipes to which the wedding company was dancing. Conversing in the most friendly way with all and sundry, the Queen moved among the company. Not till after midnight did she retire to her sleeping apartment.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394719-00026">At two o’clock in the morning there came a thunderous crash, a frightful explosion “as if five-and-twenty cannon had been fired simultaneously.” Immediately thereafter, suspicious-looking figures were seen rushing away from the house where the King lodged. A wave of terror swept through the awakened city. The gates were opened and messengers hastened to Holyrood to report the terrible news that the lonely house in Kirk o’ Field had been blown up, together with the King and his servants. Bothwell, who had been present at the wedding festivities (wishing, like Moray, to have an alibi) while his henchmen were preparing for the deed, was awakened from his sleep, or at any rate was roused from the bed where he was pretending to sleep. Hastily donning his clothes, accompanied by armed men, he made his way to the scene of the crime. The corpse of Darnley and that of the servant who slept in his room were found in the garden, clad only in their shirts. The house had been completely destroyed by an explosion of gunpowder. Bothwell contented himself with ascertaining these details, making as if he was greatly surprised at what had happened. Since he knew the real undercurrent of the affair better than anyone else, he did not try to elucidate the truth. He merely commanded that the corpses should be laid out on a bier, and after half-an-hour returned to the palace. There he told the Queen, likewise, as it seemed, just aroused from sleep, the bare fact that her husband the King, Henry of Scotland, had been murdered by unknown malefactors in an incomprehensible way.</p>
