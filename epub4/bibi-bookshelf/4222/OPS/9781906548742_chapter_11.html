Those devouring loves of classical antiquity that have become proverbial hardly excel it in frantic intensity. It shot skyward like a sheet of flame into ecstasy; its ardours spewed themselves forth into crime. When mental states are thus intensified, it is foolish to scrutinise for logic and rationality the actions of those in whom they rage, since it is of the essence of uncontrollable impulses to be irrational. Passions, like illnesses, can neither be accused nor excused; they can only be described with ever-renewed astonishment not untinged with horror in face of the elemental forces which disclose themselves from time to time in nature and not infrequently in human beings, violent discharges of energy which are not amenable to the measuring rod of customary human laws. Their expression does not belong to the realm of the conscious, but to the subconscious impulses of man, and is quite outside the circle of his personal responsibility. It is just as senseless to sit in judgement upon an individual who happens momentarily to be a prey to an overwhelming passion as it would be to call a thunderstorm to account or wish to hold an assize upon the eruption of a volcano. So Mary Stuart, a product of her epoch both in the mental and the moral sphere, must not be condemned out of hand, seeing that her actions were temporarily governed by something irrespective of her normal and hitherto moderate and sedate outlook on life. With eyes closed and ears stopped, drawn as it were by a magnet, she moved along her path towards disaster and crime. No advice could influence her, no call could awaken her. Not until the fires had burnt themselves out would she come to her senses, consumed and distraught. In one who has passed through such a furnace, life itself has been incinerated.
         </p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394718-00001">So massive a feeling cannot take hold of a person twice in the same lifetime. Just as an accumulated store of gunpowder goes up in one huge explosion, so in such an overwhelming passion are the reserves of emotion completely expended. Mary Stuart’s voluptuousness glowed at white heat for no more than half a year. Nevertheless, during this brief space her heart knew such an ecstasy that all subsequent feelings appeared to her as wraiths in a mist. Certain writers, such as Rimbaud, and certain musicians, such as Mascagni, spend themselves in a single work, and when this work is finished they lie exhausted and impotent for evermore—thus is it too with certain women who give their all in one access of passion, instead of spreading their love, as do more moderate natures, economically over decade after decade. Such women’s love and passion is a concentrated extract, their ardours are compressed into one convulsive episode, they drink the cup to the dregs, and for them there exists no salvation and no way back. Mary Stuart was a supreme example of this kind of love, of love that is spendthrift because it despises contumely and death, of love that is truly heroic, that allows passion to have its fullest range and to exhaust the emotions even should this lead to self-destruction.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394718-00002">At a first glance one may well be puzzled to account for so speedy a transformation of her affection for Darnley into her elemental passion for Bothwell. Yet such a development was both logical and natural; for, like every other art, love needs to be learnt, tested and practised. Never, or rarely—as with the arts—is the first essay in love a perfect success, and Shakespeare, the profoundest psychologist of all time, knew this well, showing that calf love is merely a tentative and initial stage to the real passion which may flame up on a day to come. One of the most admirable touches in his immortal tragedy of love is that he did not, as any lesser artist or expert judge of the human soul might have done, allow Romeo’s infatuation for Juliet to begin without a prelude, but that he made it arise as a sequel to an earlier amour for some Rosalind or the other. A fugitive and stray feeling is swept away by genuine passion; there is a prentice introduction, half unwitting, to the conscious artistry of the artist in love. Shakespeare shows in this splendid instance that there can be no full knowledge without foreboding, no wholehearted pleasure without a preliminary sojourn in the anterooms of pleasure, and that, if feeling is to soar into the infinite, it must first have been kindled in a narrow and finite realm. Only because Romeo is already in a state of inward tension, because his strong and passionate spirit craves for fuller experience of passion, does his will-to-love, having directed itself haphazardly and blindly towards Rosalind, the first-comer, then, becoming sighted and fully aware of the difference, direct itself anew and swiftly towards a supreme object, exchanging Rosalind for Juliet. “When half-gods go, the gods arrive.”</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394718-00003">In like manner Mary Stuart, awakening from the long twilight of her youth, was carried away by a blind affection for Darnley, precisely because he was comely and young and made his entry into her orbit at a propitious hour. But the lad’s dull breath was too weak to fan her inward glow. He could not lift her into the paradise of ecstasy, where the glow would have burnt itself out. It continued, therefore, like a smothered fire, to excite her senses and nevertheless disappoint them—a distressing condition in which the fires struck inward because their outward expression had been stifled. As soon, however, as he came who had the power to relieve her from this torment, he who gave air and fuel to this stifled glow, the repressed flames rushed up to heaven and down to hell. Just as Romeo’s feeling for Rosalind vanished without a trace when his genuine passion for Juliet was aroused, so did Mary Stuart completely forget her sensual inclination for Darnley in the unresting and voluptuous feeling for Bothwell.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394718-00004">We possess two sources of information relating to the story of Mary’s love for Bothwell. In the first place there are the state papers and other contemporary official documents, and there are the chronicles and the annals of the time. As second source, we have a number of letters and poems ascribed to her. The recorded facts and the self-revelation of the letters and verses dovetail into one another with the utmost precision. But the genuineness of the letters and poems is denied by those champions of Mary Stuart who, in the name of their own moral codes, believe that they must defend her against a passion against which she herself was quite defenceless. There is, of course, some ground for doubt as to the authenticity of letters and sonnets which have come down to us only in transcribed, translated and perhaps mutilated texts. The holograph versions, which would have been irrefutable evidence, were destroyed—we know when and by whom. For James, her son, had but shortly succeeded to power when, as a measure of protection for his mother’s honour as a woman, he consigned the original papers to the flames. Ever since then an embittered fight has been raging as to the authenticity of these “Casket Letters”, a party strife wherein religious motives and national served as foundation for charge and countercharge in the assize upon Mary Stuart. For one who is above party it is all the more essential that he should go warily in his judgements. In any case his conclusions can never be anything more than personal ones, since the original letters have long since been destroyed and, in the last resort therefore, he has to depend upon his individual deductions.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394718-00005">Nevertheless, if a true portrait of Mary is to be drawn, if her real character is to be depicted, an author is bound to decide one way or the other; he must make up his mind to accept these letters and poems as authentic or to declare them spurious. He cannot be allowed merely to shrug his shoulders and mutter: “Maybe they’re genuine—and, then again, maybe they’re not.” For these writings, if authentic, are a pivot whereon the whole subsequent psychical development of the woman turned. If we cast the die in favour of their genuineness, then it behoves us to prove and make perfectly clear the reasons for such an assumption.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394718-00006">As will be subsequently related in fuller detail, the letters and sonnets in question were found in a silver casket after Bothwell’s flight from Carberry Hill. It goes without saying that such missives as Mary actually wrote to her lover must have been incautious and compromising. She had always been venturesome, not to say foolhardy, and had never learnt to hide her feelings when she spoke or wrote. Next, the huge delight of her adversaries at the discovery of the originals shows that these must have contained revelations injurious or shameful to the Queen.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394718-00007">However, those who describe the Casket Letters as forgeries do not go so far as to deny that some such genuine letters may have existed. Their contention is that, during the brief interval between the discovery of the casket and the official examination of the letters, some of the Scottish lords had substituted malicious falsifications for the originals, so that the documents laid before parliament were by no manner of means those discovered in the casket. Who was responsible for this accusation? Nobody in particular. The Scottish lords of council in Edinburgh, immediately the booty had been handed over to Morton, assembled on the selfsame day and solemnly swore to the authenticity of the documents as soon as the casket was opened. Parliament too at a later date (and among the members were personal friends of the Queen), examined the script carefully and uttered no word of doubt. Subsequently, at the York Conference, they were again overhauled, and for a fourth time, at Hampton Court, they underwent close scrutiny. Each time they were compared with Mary’s writing, and each time they were declared authentic and coming from Mary’s own hand. More convincing still is it that Elizabeth had the texts printed and circulated among the courts of Europe. Now, although we have many reasons to distrust the actions of the Queen of England, we can hardly credit the assumption that she would compromise her high position by going to the length of forgery, since at any moment discovery was possible. Elizabeth was an able politician, and as such too careful to let herself be caught in a petty snare. The only person who, for repute’s sake, should have protested vehemently if the letters and sonnets were forgeries, namely Mary Stuart herself, was content to utter a feeble and quite unconvincing protest. Furthermore, she tried by underground means to hinder their production at the Conference of York. One cannot but ask why, if indeed the documents were forgeries, seeing that this would have greatly strengthened her position. An additional reason for believing that Mary suspected that her enemies had got hold of the originals is that she commanded her representatives to repudiate wholesale her authorship of everything alleged to be written by her hand, and this before any inquiry had been held. Of course this is not of very great evidential value, for in political matters Mary was never a stickler where truth was concerned. Moreover she held that her “<i>parole de prince</i>”—word as a prince—was of far greater worth than any amount of proof against her. Even when Buchanan published the letters in his <i>Detection</i>, and they were eagerly read at all the courts, Mary raised no cry of protest; she did not then declare them to be “false and feigned, forged and invented” to her “dis-honour and slander”. She was content to call her sometime Latin master a “defamatory atheist”. When writing to the Pope or to the King of France and her other relatives, she never mentioned a word about forgery of her letters and love verses. Nor was any suggestion of forgery made by the French court, to which transcripts of the letters were sent immediately after their disclosure. Among her contemporaries none cast the shadow of a doubt upon their authenticity, or raised a voice to confute so spiteful an accusation, or mooted the suggestion that fraudulent papers had been slipped into a batch of original ones. It was not for a century or so after James had rid the world of his mother’s love letters and poems that the hypothesis as to their falsification was first propounded, and this in a well-meant endeavour to describe a spirited and impulsive woman as an innocent creature incapable of doing wrong or committing a crime if such a course seemed to her necessary. These kindly souls wish us to believe that Mary was the hapless victim of a base conspiracy.
         </p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394718-00008">Unquestionably, the attitude of Mary’s contemporaries seems to prove the authenticity of both letters and love ballads, and in my opinion, when considered from the stylistic and psychological standpoint, the evidence is no less forcible. Take the verses alone. Who was there in the Scotland of that day capable of producing a whole cycle of poems in the French tongue and at such short notice? Did any living person in sixteenth-century Scotland possess such a genius for poetry as not only to reproduce the literary style of the Queen but to show so intimate an acquaintance with her hidden thoughts and feelings? No doubt there have been many remarkable forgeries of historical documents and important letters, and in the realm of literature we are acquainted with a number of apocryphal poems and other imaginative compositions, but whether we think here of Macpherson’s <i>Ossian </i>or of the Königinhof Manuscript and the like, we are concerned with skilful reproductions of the style of long-past epochs. There is, however, no record of any attempt to palm off a whole sonnet cycle upon a living author. How absurd to suppose that rough Scottish lairds, barons and earls, to whom poesy was the most alien thing on earth, would be able, animated by the desire of compromising their Queen, to produce eleven sonnets in French. Again, I ask, who was this nameless genius, this magician, who possessed the gift for composing in a foreign tongue a sequence of love verses so precisely in the style of the Queen that the work could be attributed to her pen without raising a doubt in the minds of any of her relatives, her friends or her contemporaries? Not one of her champions has so far answered this question. Not even Ronsard, not even du Bellay, could have done as much. How ridiculous then to ascribe such a talent to the Mortons, the Argylls, the Hamiltons or the Gordons, who could wield the sword well enough, but did not know French sufficiently to carry on a dinner-table talk.
         </p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394718-00009">No unprejudiced person can doubt the genuineness of the poems, and since the style of these sonnets is in perfect harmony with that of the letters, we have to admit that the latter are authentic and were written by Mary herself. Maybe in the course of the translation into Latin and into Scots certain details were doctored, or tampered with, and it is obvious that a few interpolations were made. A final consideration, a psychological one, has to be adduced in favour of the letters being Mary’s. If a suppositious “gang of criminals” inspired by hatred and malice had set to work forging letters, would not the forgers have produced documents showing beyond question that the alleged author was a contemptible creature, a lascivious and spiteful wanton? They would have been wasting their pains if, in their desire to injure Mary, they had produced as forgeries the extant Casket Letters, which exculpate her rather than incriminate her, exhibiting as they do Mary’s horror at her foreknowledge of and complicity in the intended crime against young Darnley. For what these documents show forth is not the voluptuousness of passion but its bitter distress. The letters are like the muffled cries of one who is being burnt alive.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394718-00010">Although, as already said, the letters are in Mary’s style, they are rough-hewn. They manifest a wild and confused flow of thought and feeling, were evidently written in haste and disorder by a hand that (one feels) was tremulous with excitement. All these things are fully accordant with what we know from other sources regarding the Queen’s overstrained mental condition during the days from which they date, and they correspond to the writer’s actions at the same period. None but the most skilful of psychologists could have imagined so perfect a spiritual background for the known facts. Moray, Lethington and Buchanan, who by turns and haphazard have been mentioned as the forger by professional champions of Mary’s honour, were neither Shakespeares nor Balzacs nor Dostoevskys, but little souls, able to finesse and to cheat when trickery would serve their turn, but utterly incompetent, putting pen to paper, to produce word pictures so admirably representing Mary Stuart for all time. First let the genius who forged these letters be produced! We, who know that Mary in times of stress always poured her heart out in verse, can have no doubt that she composed both letters and poems. This granted, we can have no better testimony than her own as to her state of mind at this juncture.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394718-00011">The verses reveal the beginning of her unfortunate passion. Three or four lines disclose that Mary’s love for Bothwell did not arise by a slow process of crystallisation, but seized an unsuspecting woman as its prey. The immediate occasion was, apparently, a crude act of bodily possession, an onslaught by Bothwell that was half or wholly rape. In her sonnet the darkness is dispelled by a lightning flash:</p>

            <p class="fp" id="rw-fp_394718-00002"><i>Pour luy aussi, ie gete mainte larme.</i>

            </p>
         </div> 
         <p class="fp" id="rw-p_394718-00012">(Full many a tear have I wept because of him. The first was shed when he took possession of my body, whose heart did not then belong to him.) Instantly we are made to feel the situation. For weeks Mary had been thrown into close companionship with Bothwell. As chief adviser, and as commander of her armed forces, he had accompanied her from castle to castle. Since she had so recently chosen a beautiful and high-born lady as his wife, and had graced the wedding with her royal presence, it never occurred to her to think of him as a suitor; she was a queen, he a vassal; her position was inviolable. She could, therefore, travel about her realm with him unconcerned. But some of Mary’s most charming qualities, her lack of caution and her sense of security, had always been a danger to her. One can picture the scene. Presumably she had allowed him some trifling liberties, showing towards him that coquetry which twice already had led to disaster, in the cases of Chastelard and of Rizzio. He was alone with her for hours; she talked with him more confidentially than was customary; jested and sported with him. But Bothwell was no Chastelard, no romantic lute-player and languishing troubadour; Bothwell was not a Rizzio, an upstart with a flattering tongue; Bothwell was a man with hot senses and hard muscles, a creature of impulse and instinct, who would not shrink from any audacity. Such a man does not lightly allow himself to be led on and stimulated. Abruptly, he must have seized her, this woman who had long been in a vacillating and irritable state of mind, whose passionate nature had been aroused by her foolish fondness for Darnley—aroused but not assuaged. “<i>Il se fit de ce corps possesseur</i>”—he took her by storm or violated her. Who, at such moments, can distinguish between the two? They are moments of intoxication when a woman’s longing to give herself and desire to defend herself interlace. On Bothwell’s side the act of possession was probably just as little premeditated as it had been on Mary’s. The embrace was not the fulfilment of a tender inclination which had been growing in ardour over a lengthy period of time, but an impulsive act of lust devoid of spiritual tone, a purely physical capture.
         </p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394718-00013">The effect on Mary Stuart was overwhelming. Something wholly new invaded her life like a thunderclap. In taking possession of her body, Bothwell had also raped her soul. Both of her husbands, the fifteen-year-old boy Francis II and the beardless Darnley, had lacked virility; they had been weaklings. In her experience of sexual relations Mary had hitherto bestowed herself magnanimously, to confer pleasure on her partner, remaining mistress and Queen even in this intimate sphere; she had never played the passive role, had never been possessed by force. In this encounter with Bothwell, which left her amazed senses tingling with surprise, she came for the first time into close contact with the primitive male, one who trampled upon her femininity, her modesty, her pride, her sense of security, and therewith he caused a voluptuous uprush from a universe within herself hitherto unsuspected. Before she realised the danger and before she even thought of warding it off, she had already been conquered. This taking of her body by storm gave vent to a geyser of feeling—of feeling which, in the first moment of alarm, may have been dominated by wrath, by fierce hatred of the ruffian who had thus brutally ravaged her womanly pride. But it is one of the profoundest mysteries of our composite souls, as we find in external nature, that extremes meet, and especially in the realm of feeling. The skin cannot distinguish between intense heat and intense cold; frost can burn like fire. A woman may pass in one moment from hatred into love, from mortified pride to uttermost humility; she may desire and affirm with all the wealth of her body that which, a moment before, she has repudiated and regarded with loathing.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394718-00014">The upshot in the present case was that, henceforward, a woman who had been tolerably reflective was consumed by an inner fire. What had hitherto been the pillars sustaining her life (honour, dignity, repute, pride, self-confidence and reason) collapsed. Having once plunged into deep waters, she wished for nothing better than to sink in them. A new and strange voluptuousness seized upon her. Avid and intoxicated, Mary wished to enjoy so novel a sensation at the cost of self-destruction. Humbly she kissed the hand of the man who had annihilated her womanly pride and had taught her the ecstasy of self-surrender.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394718-00015">This passion was something immeasurably vaster than her fondness for Darnley. With Darnley she had played at self-surrender; now it had become deadly earnest. With Darn-ley she had merely wanted to share the crown, her sovereign authority, her life. To Bothwell she wished to give, not this, that or the other, but all that she had on earth, impoverishing herself to enrich him, lustfully debasing herself from her high estate in order to uplift him to the skies. With an unwonted thrill, Mary flung aside restraints, that she might seize and hold him who had become for her the only man in the world. She knew that her friends would forsake her, that people in general would revile her and look upon her with contempt. But these realities gave her another pride in place of that which had been shattered, and she enthusiastically proclaimed the fact:</p>

I hope for him nothing but good fortune. For his sake I wish to retain health and life …) Unduly tensed feelings affect the mind profoundly. Storms of passion liberate unfamiliar and unique energies in women such as Mary, who had hitherto been reserved and indifferent. During these weeks her mental and bodily life seemed multiplied tenfold, and she showed capabilities she had never shown before nor was ever to show again. She spent eighteen hours in the saddle, and then sat up nearly all night writing letters. Though as poetess she had hitherto composed no more than brief epigrams and casual fragments of verse, under the stimulus of fresh inspiration she penned the sonnet cycle in which her pleasures and her pains were manifested with wonderful command of language. Ordinarily incautious, at this time she concealed her sentiments most effectively, with the result that for months none suspected her intimacy with Bothwell. His lightest touch made her senses reel, yet before the eyes of the world she addressed him as calmly as any other subordinate; she preserved a cheerful mien while her nerves were twitching and her mind was filled with despair. A demonic superego took possession of her, lending her a strength which far transcended her natural powers.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394718-00017">But these achievements had to be paid for by a terrible collapse. When this ensued, day after day she remained in bed, utterly exhausted; or else she wandered for hours from room to room in a state of partial stupefaction, sobbing and groaning, exclaiming “<i>je voudrais être morte</i>”<i>—</i>I would like to be dead<i>—</i>clamouring for a knife with which to stab herself. Thus her vitality would wane as strangely as it came to her rescue again.
         </p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394718-00018">Nothing can show more plainly than does the famous Jedburgh episode how much her body had been exhausted by the frenzy of passion. On 7th October 1566, in an affray with a border brigand, Bothwell was dangerously wounded. The news reached Mary on her way to the town, where she was about to hold an assize. Though her first impulse was to ride forthwith to Hermitage, twenty-five miles away, she restrained the impulse lest such behaviour should arouse remark. There can be no doubt, however, that she was profoundly distressed by the tidings, for du Croc, the French ambassador (who was the most dispassionate observer in her entourage, and who could not as yet have had an inkling of her liaison with Bothwell), reported to Paris: “<i>Ce ne luy eust esté peu de perte de le perdre</i>”<i>—</i>To lose him would have been no small loss to her. Lethington too noticed how absent-minded she was but, being equally ignorant of the true state of affairs, he opined that her “thought and displeasure had their root in the King.”

         <p id="rw-p_394718-00019">Not until a week had elapsed and the assize was over did the Queen ride over to Hermitage Castle accompanied by Moray and others of her lords. She spent two hours by the wounded man’s bedside and rode back to Jedburgh the same afternoon. On dismounting, she fell into a faint which lasted two hours. Thereafter she was feverish and delirious. Then her body suddenly stiffened; she neither saw nor felt anything. Her courtiers and the doctor stood round, contemplating her with alarm. Messengers were sent in all directions to fetch the King and the bishop—the latter to administer extreme unction. For a week Mary hovered between life and death, since seemingly her secret wish to die had sapped her vital forces. What shows, however, that the collapse was mental rather than physical, that it was, indeed, a characteristic hysterical attack, is the fact that as soon as Bothwell, now regaining health and strength, was brought to Jedburgh in a horse litter, the Queen took a turn for the better and, a fortnight after her suite had supposed her to be dying, she was well enough to be in the saddle once more. Danger had threatened her from within, and from within it had been overcome.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394718-00020">Though restored in body, for the next few weeks the Queen was much distraught in mind. Comparative strangers noticed that she had become “a different person”. Something in her aspect and her manner underwent modification; her usual levity and self-confidence vanished. Her demeanour was that of one sorely afflicted. She shut herself up in her room, and through the closed door her ladies could hear her sobbing. But though it was her custom to be frank and outspoken, on this occasion she confided in no one. Her lips remained closed, and none guessed the secret which burdened her mind by day and by night</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394718-00021">A terrible feature of Mary’s infatuation for Bothwell, that which made it at once splendid and gruesome, was that from the first the Queen must have known her love to be sinful, and disastrous to the plans she had most at heart. Her awakening from the first embrace must have been like that of Tristan and Iseult from the effects of the love potion, when they recalled that they were not living by themselves in the infinite realm of love, but were bound to this world by numerous ties and duties. So Mary probably realised her situation. She who had given herself to Bothwell was another man’s wife, and Both-well another woman’s husband. This was a twofold adultery into which the turmoil of the senses had led her. How long was it—two weeks, or three, or four—since she herself, Mary Queen of Scotland and the Isles, had signed and issued an edict declaring adultery and every form of illicit lust to be capital offences? From the outset her insane passion was, therefore, branded as a crime. Having committed a crime, she could save herself from punishment only by further criminal offences. If ever she and Bothwell were to be wedded, she would have forcibly to rid herself of her husband, and Bothwell to divorce his wife. This love plant could bear none but poisoned fruit. In so desperate a plight, Mary’s courage rallied though she realised that she would never again enjoy peace of mind and knew that henceforward she was past saving. As always, her intrepid nature came to her aid, were it no more than an endeavour to try vain hazards and to challenge fate. She refused to draw back like a coward; she would not draw back; she would, with head erect, march forward to the abyss. Though she should lose all, there would be joy in her torment, since she would lose all for her lover’s sake.</p>

         <p id="rw-p_394718-00023">The most obnoxious feature of her situation, the utmost extremity of her torment, remains to be told. Mad folly notwithstanding, Mary Stuart was too shrewd not to recognise that she had once more given herself in vain, that the man towards whom her whole being turned did not really love her. Bothwell had possessed her, as he had possessed many another wench, sensually, swiftly and brutally. He was as ready to leave her in the lurch as he had been ready to leave other women when the hot fit was over. For him, the rape of Mary Stuart had been no more than a passing adventure. In her despairing verses she discloses her knowledge that the man who had worshipped her body for a fleeting moment did not love her mind.</p>

Painful was the way in which her previous arrogance was now replaced by self-abasement. She implored, she supplicated, she extolled her own merits, offering herself to her lover, to the man who would not love her, after the manner of a salesman making the most of his goods. So completely had she lost all sense of personal dignity that she, who had once been queenly and self-reliant, retailed to him like a chaffering market woman the sacrifices she had made for him, and went on to emphasise her submissiveness.</p>

Bothwell must have given Mary cause to believe that he was more attached to the wife whom she had provided for him than he was to herself, and that he had no inclination to desert his wife for the Queen. Now, therefore (is it not horrible that a great love can make a woman so paltry?), she proceeded to disparage Lady Bothwell in the most ignoble and malicious way. She tried to stimulate his erotic masculine vanity by telling him that his wife did not show enough ardour when in his embraces. The gossip must have been passed on to her by some intimate of the Bothwell household. “<i>Quant vous l’aymez, elle usoit de froi-deur</i>”<i>—</i>When you made love to her, she showed coldness<i>—</i>she writes, implying that Lady Bothwell surrendered herself hesitatingly, frigidly, instead of with the warmth of true passion. In contemptible self-praise, she tells him how much she, the adulteress, is sacrificing for Bothwell, whereas his wife reaps advantages and pleasure from his greatness. Let him stay then with herself alone, not allowing himself to be humbugged by the letters and tears and conjurations of that “false” woman.

         <p class="fp" id="rw-p_394718-00026">(Now she begins to see that she has made a great mistake in not valuing the love of such a lover and would gladly deceive you, my beloved, by writing letters stuffed with knowledge … nevertheless, her inflated words, her tears, her fictitious plaints, her loud cries and lamentations, have so won you over that you have kept her letters, in which you believe, and thus you love her and trust her more than me.) More and more despairing do her cries become. She is the only woman worthy of his love; he must not forsake her for an unworthy wife. He must put away this creature and unite his lot with that of his Queen and lover who is ready to walk beside him whatsoever may befall, through life and into the very jaws of death. Mary implores Bothwell to ask what proof he will of her everlasting devotion, for she is prepared to sacrifice all—house, home, possessions, crown, honour and child. Let him take everything from her, so long as he keeps her who has wholly given herself to him, body, soul and destiny.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394718-00027">For the first time a lambent ray was shed upon the background of this tragical landscape; the scene was flooded with light by Mary’s frenzied avowals. Bothwell had possessed her in a casual way as he had possessed so many others and, so far as he was concerned, that would have sufficed. Queen Mary, however, a thrall to him both with her soul and her senses, all fire and ecstasy, wanted to bind him to her for ever. Now, for this ambitious man, happy in his recent marriage, a mere liaison had no charm. At most, Bothwell might have thought it advantageous to remain, for a while, on terms of intimacy with the woman in whose gift were the supreme honours and dignities of Scotland, to have Mary as concubine without disturbing his relations towards his legal wife. This did not suffice the Queen, who was of a regal disposition; nor the woman, who cared not to share a lover, but wanted him for herself alone. Yet how could she bind him to her side, this wild and unbridled adventurer? Her promises of fidelity, her asseverations of humility, could not be particularly alluring to Bothwell. They were more likely to bore him, for he must have heard them too often from other feminine lips. Only one prize was calculated to attract so greedy and ambitious a man: the highest, which so many had coveted—the crown. However disinclined Bothwell may have been to go on playing the part of lover to a woman whom he did not love, he could not but find it a seductive thought that this woman was a queen, and that by her will he might become King of Scotland.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394718-00028">At the first glance such a notion must have seemed preposterous. Mary Stuart’s lawful spouse, Henry Darnley, was alive and bore the title of King. There was no room for another bearing that title. Yet this preposterous thought was the only link that could keep Mary and Bothwell together, the former yearning for love and the latter for power. He was a strong man, craving for freedom and independence; she was completely under his spell; nothing could permanently bind him to her but the crown. In her infatuation, forgetting honour, prestige, dignity and law, she was ready to pay the price. Even though she could bestow the crown on Bothwell only through committing a crime, she would not shrink from crime.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394718-00029">Just as Macbeth could fulfil the witches’ demoniacal prophecy, could become King, only by the slaughter of a whole royal kinship, so Bothwell’s path to the throne must lead him over Darnley’s corpse. Blood must be spilt before his blood and Mary’s could mingle.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394718-00030">Moral scruples never troubled Bothwell. We cannot doubt that so bold a man as he must have been ready enough to slay a king in order to wear a crown. Even if the written promise, said to have been found among the papers in the casket, the letter in which Mary avers in so many words that she will marry Bothwell in defiance of objections that might be raised by her relatives and others, were ultimately proved to be a forgery, yet the earl was so sure of his ground that he needed no signed and sealed document to force the Queen to carry out any plan that might mature in his mind. Often had she complained to him, as to all and sundry, that the thought of her irreparable union with Darnley oppressed and mortified her; over and over again, in her love verses (and we may well surmise in private interviews too), she assured Bothwell that her one and only desire was to bind herself to him for ever; why, then, should he hesitate to risk the most foolhardy deeds when he knew himself to be backed up by such plain-spoken assurances?</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394718-00031">He knew, likewise (though nothing was openly said in the matter), that he could count upon the support of the Scottish lords, since they were unanimous in their hatred for their tiresome and vicious young master who had not kept faith with them but had shamelessly betrayed them in the Rizzio and in other affairs. Nothing would please them better than that by some means the King could be got out of the country. Bothwell was present too at Craigmiller Castle during the famous conference, attended by the Queen, when all conceivable ways of freeing Mary and Scotland from Darnley were discussed. The highest dignitaries of the realm, Moray, Lethington, Argyll, Huntly and Bothwell, were agreed in trying to strike a bargain with their sovereign lady. If she would recall Morton, Lindsay and Ruthven, who had been banished on account of their complicity in Rizzio’s murder, they, for their part, would “find the means that Your Majesty shall be quit of him.” At the time they merely spoke of getting “quit of him” by legal measures, such as a divorce. Mary herself made the riddance conditional on its not bringing any slur upon her son. Lethington hinted that she could leave ways and means to her faithful servants, and that they should so act as to bring no “prejudice to your son”. Moray too, who as Protestant was even less scrupulous in such questions, is reported as saying that he would “look through his fingers and will behold our doings, saying nothing of the same.” The proposals, however, made Mary uneasy, so that she insisted: “I will that ye do nothing through which any spot may be laid upon my honour or conscience.” Behind these dark sayings there lurked a sinister meaning, which Both-well was the last man in the world to misconstrue. This point comes out perfectly clear—Mary Stuart, Moray, Lethington and Bothwell, the star performers of the tragedy, were determined to rid themselves of Darnley. One problem alone remained to be solved—how was the deed to be executed? Was it to be done by gentle means or by force?</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394718-00032">Bothwell, since he was the boldest and the most impatient member of the Scottish aristocracy, preferred force. He could not and would not wait, since he was not, like the others, moved merely by the wish to sweep the troublesome youngster out of the path, but by the determination to succeed to crown and realm. Though the others might be satisfied to wish, while watching the progress of events, he had to act resolutely. There is reason to suppose that, on the quiet, at this juncture he was already on the lookout for confederates among the Scottish lords. Once more, however, the lights of history burnt low, since the preparations for a crime are naturally made in dark places. We shall never know how many of the lords were implicated in this matter, whether as confederates or acquiescent onlookers. It seems possible that Moray knew of the scheme, but refrained from active participation. Lethington, on the other hand, appears to have behaved less cautiously. The most trustworthy information is derived from Morton’s dying confession. He had just returned from outlawry full of hatred for Darnley, the traitor. Knowing this, Bothwell bluntly proposed that they should co-operate in the murder of Darnley. Morton’s experience after the assassination of Rizzio, when his associates left him in the lurch, made him cautious. He insisted upon safeguards. Was the Queen privy to the affair? Bothwell, eager for Morton’s aid, did not hesitate to answer in the affirmative. But Morton knew that verbal assurances were apt to be repudiated when a plot such as this had achieved its goal, so he refused to move in the matter without the Queen’s written approval. He demanded one of those famous bonds, wherewith he could exonerate himself in case of need. Bothwell promised that a bond should be forthcoming. Manifestly, however, the pledge was futile, for the Queen would be able to marry him after the murder only if she remained in the background and could affect surprise when the deed was done.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394718-00033">Once more then Bothwell was thrust back on his own resources, and proved equal to the occasion. Still, the way in which Morton, Moray and Lethington had received his approaches showed him that they were nowise opposed to the scheme, and that he might consider himself to have a free hand. If not by their signatures to a document, they had at least declared their assent by a silence full of meaning and by a friendly aloofness. Now that Mary and Bothwell and the Scottish lords were of one mind, Darnley’s fate was sealed.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394718-00034">Everything was prepared. Bothwell made arrangements with a few hardy caitiffs, agreeing with them as to the place and method of the murder. One thing was lacking—the victim. Darnley, however much of a nincompoop, must have had an inkling of what awaited him. For several weeks he refused to go to Holyrood so long as the Scottish lords were there. He did not feel safe at Stirling Castle, now that Rizzio’s assassins, those men with whom he had broken troth, had been readmitted to Scotland by Mary’s act of clemency. Refusing invitations and firmly resisting lures, he stayed in Glasgow. His father, the Earl of Lennox, was there with other trusty friends and allies. Here he had a stronghold. On the Clyde was a vessel, and in case of need he could embark and make his escape by sea. Then, as if at the most dangerous hour fate wanted to protect him, during the early days of January 1567 he fell ill of smallpox, this providing him with a welcome pretext for staying weeks longer in safe harbourage at Glasgow.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394718-00035">The King’s illness interfered with the plans made by Bothwell. He was waiting impatiently in Edinburgh. For some unknown reason the Earl was now in a hurry. Perhaps he was eager for the crown; perhaps he thought there were too many initiates, so that the scheme would soon be blown upon; anyhow he wished to bring matters speedily to a head. Yet how could Darnley, already suspicious and now ill in bed, be attracted to the place of slaughter? An open summons would warn him. Neither Moray nor Lethington nor anyone else at court was in the young monarch’s good graces, or likely to be able to persuade him to return. One person in the world had power over the poor weakling, one to whom he was devoted, and who had twice succeeded, ere this, in making him subservient to her will. Mary, if she feigned affection for the man who wanted nothing but her love, might perhaps lull his suspicions to sleep. None other could achieve this colossal deception. Since she herself was no longer mistress of her will, but blindly obeyed the orders of him to whom she had given her heart, Bothwell had merely to issue his commands and the incredible happened, or that happened which our modern feelings make incredible. On 22nd January, Mary Stuart, who for weeks had avoided any contact with her husband, rode to Glasgow, ostensibly to visit the young fellow, but really to entice him back to Edinburgh, where death awaited him.</p>
