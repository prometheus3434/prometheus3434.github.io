         <p class="fp" id="rw-fp_394723-00001"><span class="dropcap">N</span><span class="sc">O IMAGINATIVE WRITER</span> but Shakespeare could have adequately encompassed the Bothwell tragedy as a drama or a work of fiction but a British writer of less weight has, with considerable success, described the romantic and touching postlude at Lochleven Castle—Walter Scott. Yet anyone who has read <i>The Abbot </i>in childhood will continue, throughout life, to regard this historical “fiction” as more vivid and even more truthful than what is called historical “truth”, for when a gifted imaginative writer sets to work, the beautiful legend he constructs will often gain the victory over reality. We have all had our early emotions touched by these scenes, which have made a deep impress on our affective life and have permanently influenced our sympathies, for the elements of romance were ready to the writer’s practised hand: there were the grim jailers who kept watch over the unhappy Queen; the calumniators who blotted her scutcheon; she herself, young, kindly and beautiful, able to transform her enemies’ cruelty into clemency, to inflame the hearts of the men with whom she came into contact until they were filled with a spirit of chivalry and self-sacrifice. The setting, too, was no less romantic than the motif—the gloomy stronghold on an island in a lovely lake. From the dormer window Mary could catch glimpses of her beautiful Scottish realm with its forests and mountains, its perpetual charm. In the far distance she could discern the chill waters of the North Sea. The poetic energies in the hearts of the Scottish people have been, so to say, embodied in this romantic episode of Mary at Lochleven, and when once such a legend has been created, it comes to form a lasting element in the blood of a nation. For each successive generation it is recreative, arousing fresh faith. Like an imperishable tree, it throws forth new blossoms year after year, possessed of a higher truth beside which the arid truths of documents wither. What has once been thus created by the immortal power of imaginative genius maintains itself in virtue of its beauty. Those who, in a later, maturer and more sceptical epoch, try to elicit the facts that underlie so impressive a legend find that these facts are repellently bald—like a prose paraphrase of a magnificent poem.
         </p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394723-00001">The supreme danger of legend, however, is that those who give it currency tend to ignore that which is genuinely tragical in favour of that which is merely sentimental. Thus the balladesque tale of Mary Stuart’s imprisonment at Lochleven makes no mention of the innermost, the most human of her distresses. Sir Walter Scott stubbornly omits to relate that Queen Mary was with child by the murderer of her previous husband, and thus leaves out of account the full horror of her position during those months of humiliation. For if the babe she bore in her womb were (as was likely enough in the circumstances) to come prematurely into the world, the pitiless calendar of nature would disclose for all to read when she had first given herself to Bothwell. There is little or no doubt that she had done so before the formal wedding—maybe at a time when surrender to his embraces signified adultery; maybe during the period of mourning for Darnley, at Seton, or in the time of her strange wanderings from castle to castle; maybe (and probably) while Darnley was still alive. No one can fully understand Mary’s distressful state of mind at Lochleven who fails to recall that the birth of Bothwell’s child would betray to a censorious world the date at which her fatal passion for the Earl had begun.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394723-00002">What actually occurred in this respect remains a mystery from which the veil has never been lifted. We do not know how many months Mary had been with child when she was imprisoned at Lochleven; we do not know when she was freed from the burden of this undesired pregnancy; we do not know whether the child came into the world alive or was stillborn; if the pregnancy was brought to a premature conclusion, we do not know at what stage. Obscurity and suppositions envelop the whole affair; the witnesses are contradictory; and only this much is certain—that Mary had good reason for keeping the birth secret. It is suspicious enough that in none of her letters does she say a word about the birth of Bothwell’s child. According to the reports of Claud Nau, Sieur de Fontenay, who was her private secretary at this time, she gave birth at Lochleven to twins, prematurely and, since she had her apothecary with her in the castle, we may guess that the prematurity was assisted. According to another account, which equally lacks confirmation, the fruit of her union with Bothwell was not twins born too early to be viable, but a living daughter, who was secretly shipped to France, to be brought up there in a nunnery, ignorant of her royal descent. The key that might have unlocked these mysteries has been sunk for ever in the waters of Lochleven.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394723-00003">The fact that Queen Mary’s guardians helped her to cover up the mystery of the birth of Bothwell’s child at Lochleven Castle shows that they were not the hard-hearted jailers of the legend. Lady Douglas of Lochleven, to whose care the Queen had been committed, had more than thirty years before been mistress of King James V, to whom she had borne six children, the eldest being now the Regent Moray. After King James’s death she married Earl Douglas of Lochleven, and by him had seven children. A woman who had thirteen times experienced the pangs of labour and who had suffered the spiritual distress of bearing her first children out of wedlock was well able to understand and sympathise with Mary Stuart’s pitiable plight. The stories of her harshness towards the royal prisoner may be regarded as fabulous, and we cannot doubt that Mary, though a prisoner, was treated as an exalted guest. The dethroned Queen had a suite of rooms, her own cook, her own apothecary, four or five ladies-in-waiting or female domestics; she had the free run of the castle and the island, and she seems even to have been allowed the pleasures of the chase. If we strip the story of her life at Lochleven of sentimental trammels, we shall come to the conclusion that her treatment at the castle was extremely considerate. For, though the sentimentalists would fain have us overlook the fact, Mary had (to say the least of it) been somewhat remiss in her conduct, having married the murderer of her husband three months after the crime. As regards the question of her complicity in the murder, were she to be re-tried by a modern court of justice, the best plea that could be put in for her would be “extenuating circumstances” on the ground of her spiritual thraldom to Bothwell. If this woman whose behaviour had been a scandal to Europe and who had thrown the country over which she ruled into renewed disorder was kept in seclusion for a while, this was to her own advantage as well as to that of Scotland. During these months of retreat, she was given a chance of calming her over-stimulated nerves, of regaining command of her will, which had been paralysed by her infatuation for Bothwell. In a word, imprisonment at Lochleven saved her for a time from the dangers to which she would otherwise have been exposed by her own foolhardiness, unrest and impatience; safeguarded her from the opportunity for committing numerous follies.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394723-00004">In any case Mary’s detention at Lochleven must be regarded as mild punishment for what she had done amiss, when compared with what befell her accomplice and lover. Notwithstanding the solemn pledges that had been given, Bothwell became a hunted outlaw; a price of a thousand crowns had been set on his head, and his best friends in Scotland would have betrayed and sold him for that sum. The Earl, however, was not so easy to get hold of. Having vainly attempted to rally the borderers, he fled to the Orkneys, hoping thence to levy war against the Scottish lords. Regent Moray, however, dispatched four warships against him, and Bothwell escaped capture only by taking to sea in a nutshell of a boat. This little vessel was intended merely for coasting traffic among the islands, but in it, through stormy weather, the Earl made his way to Norway, arriving with torn sails, and being taken on board a Danish warship. Bothwell hoped to remain unrecognised, and borrowed a suit of ordinary clothing from some of his shipmates. He thought he would fare better if regarded as a pirate than if he were known to be the outlawed consort of the Queen of Scotland and the Isles. He was recognised, however, carried hither and thither, and at length set at liberty in Denmark. But even there, when fortune seemed to favour him, this adventurer wrecked his chances by seducing a Danish girl under promise of marriage. She brought a suit against him.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394723-00005">Meanwhile, the authorities in Copenhagen had learnt of what crimes Bothwell was accused in Scotland, so that the axe seemed ready for his neck. Diplomatic couriers hastened hither and thither. Moray demanded his extradition, and Queen Elizabeth was yet more urgent in the matter, wanting him as witness for the crown against Mary Stuart. The latter’s French relatives, however, were secretly working upon the King of Denmark, in order to prevent the surrender of one whose testimony might have proved so defamatory to the Queen of Scots. He was kept in rigorous confinement, and in prison he was safer than he would have been at large. Day after day, however, the man whose boldness was notorious in a hundred fights and forays had to dread lest he should be sent back to Scotland in chains, to perish under fearful tortures as a regicide. He was continually moved from one prison to another, kept behind strong bars like a dangerous beast, and he knew well that nothing but death would free him. Intolerably lonely and inactive, this vigorous man, who had been the terror of his enemies and the darling of the fair sex, now week after week, month after month, year after year, had to endure the living death of perpetual imprisonment. Could there be conceived a more horrible torture for one whose natural element was activity and freedom, one who loved the chase, who had ridden often to battle surrounded by his faithful retainers, who had enjoyed the favour of women wherever he went and had taken delight also in the things of the spirit? Now this paralysing inactivity in one prison cell after another! We learn from credible reports that he became frenzied in his solitude, dashing himself against the bars and the walls, to die insane in 1578, at the age of forty-two, after ten years of purgatory. Of the many who suffered death and martyrdom for Mary Stuart, Bothwell, the man whom she had most ardently loved, atoned longer and more horribly than any other.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394723-00006">Did Mary Stuart continue to think of Bothwell? Was she still in thrall to him, in spite of time and distance? Or was her glowing bondage gradually dissolved? The latter is true, for, as we shall learn, she entertained various schemes for other marriages and, to pave the way for these, begged the Pope to annul the “forced” wedding to Bothwell. She also sent a messenger to Denmark and induced the Earl to sign a document agreeing to the dissolution of their marriage. It is plain that, as soon as she had risen from childbed, she was able once more to exercise the old lure and become again a centre of disturbance. She drew a young man into her charmed circle, and involved his fate with hers.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394723-00007">The biographer of Mary Queen of Scotland and the Isles finds reason again and again to complain that the portraits of her which have come down to us were limned by mediocre artists, so that they give us no insight into her true nature. They show nothing more than a charming, tranquil, kindly, gentle face, making no disclosure of the sensual charm this extraordinary woman must have exerted. Wherever she went she won friends, even from among her foes. As bride and as widow, on every throne and in every prison, she radiated an aura which aroused sympathy and made the environing atmosphere warm with friendliness. Very soon after her arrival at Lochleven, she awakened so much interest in the young Earl of Ruthven (son of the man who had been among the leaders in the murder of Rizzio) that the Scottish lords thought it expedient to remove him from his position as jailer. Thereupon she exercised her witchery upon another stripling, George Douglas, youngest son of Lady Douglas of Lochleven, and therefore Moray’s half-brother, though not Mary’s blood relation. Within a few weeks George was ready to do anything for her and became the chief assistant in her flight.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394723-00008">Was he merely this? Was not George Douglas something more during her months of imprisonment at Lochleven? Did his liking for her remain purely chivalrous and platonic? <i>Ignorabimus—</i>we will never know. Anyhow, Mary turned the young fellow’s fondness to practical account, using her customary arts of deception and cunning. A queen can always exert another lure in addition to personal charm, for the man who wins her hand may win to power. We guess, though we do not know, that Mary made Lady Douglas of Lochleven more pliable by talking of the possibility of a marriage to George. At any rate, it was not long before the supervision over the imprisoned Queen’s movements was slackened, and Mary forthwith concentrated her thoughts and activities upon plans for escape.
         </p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394723-00009">The first attempt, on 25th March 1568, miscarried, although it had been carefully thought out. Every week a washerwoman with some other girls came across to the island in a boat. Douglas had a talk with this laundress, who agreed to exchange clothes with the Queen. Safeguarded against recognition by the laundress’ coarse clothing and by a thick muffler, Mary walked boldly past the sentries at the castle gates. She was already being rowed across the lake, towards the shore where George Douglas was to await her with horses, when it occurred to one of the oarsmen to dally with the slender, muffled woman who was clad as a laundress. Wanting to see whether her face was as pretty as her figure, he tried to draw aside the muffler, which Mary obstinately held with her slender and delicate white hands. These hands, being well cared for, were obviously out of keeping with her dress. The boatmen became alarmed, and although the Queen angrily commanded them to continue on their course, they put about and took her back to prison.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394723-00010">The attempt at escape was promptly reported to Edinburgh, and thenceforward the prisoner was kept under closer supervision. George Douglas was forbidden to re-enter the castle. From the neighbourhood, however, he managed to communicate with the Queen, and conveyed tidings from her to her supporters. For by now, after a year of Moray’s regency, although Mary had been exposed to public opprobrium as a murderess, fresh supporters came to her aid. Some of the Scottish lords, especially the Huntlys and the Setons, being no friends to the regent, were faithful to her cause. Strangely enough, however, Mary found her most trusty adherents to be the Hamiltons, who had hitherto proved her fiercest adversaries. Of course there had been an old feud between the Hamiltons and the Stuarts. The Hamiltons came next in power to the Stuarts among the great families, and had long hoped to secure the crown for a member of their clan; now there had suddenly dawned the possibility of gaining their ambition by marrying off one of their number to Queen Mary. Since politics have no concern with morality, this fine scheme immediately led them to espouse the cause of the woman for whose execution as murderess they had been clamouring a few months before. We need hardly suppose that Mary seriously intended to marry one of the Hamiltons. Had she forgotten Bothwell so soon? More likely she only toyed with the proposal in order to escape from Lochleven. George Douglas, to whom (in the desperation of a prisoner) she had also promised her hand in marriage, went on with the preparations for her escape. By 2nd May 1568, everything was ready, and, as always when courage would serve her turn better than prudence, Mary was equal to the occasion.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394723-00011">The flight from Lochleven was as romantically effected as was proper to the romantic life of this Queen. Mary Stuart or George Douglas had enlisted the services of a lad of sixteen, Willie Douglas, who served as page in the castle, which he had entered as a foundling in infancy. Willie was a bright youth, who played his role well. Under the strict regime that now prevailed at Lochleven it was decreed that, when the family supped in the great hall and the guards also came in to supper, the gates should be locked and the keys should be laid on the table close to the hand of the castellan, Sir William Douglas, Laird of Lochleven, who would keep them under his pillow during the night. On the evening in question, the sharp-witted youngster, while serving at table, dropped a napkin over the keys, and then, when the company had been richly supplied with wine and was carrying on a cheerful conversation, he made off with the keys enveloped in the napkin. Thereafter everything was carried out as had been prearranged. Mary Stuart put on the dress of one of her tirewomen; the boy ran downstairs, unlocked the doors, and when the disguised Queen had made her exit, he locked them again from the outside. On the way to the Kinross shore, he dropped the bunch of keys into the lake and, to increase the difficulty of pursuit, he towed all the castle boats behind him as he rowed Mary to the shore, where George Douglas and Lord Seton were awaiting her with fifty riders. Now the little force, with the liberated Queen in their midst, galloped off through the darkness to Lord Seton’s castle of West Niddry, where they halted for the night. With freedom, her courage returned.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394723-00012">Such is the balladesque story of the escape of Mary Stuart from Lochleven Castle, an escape in which she was aided by the devotion of two Douglases: George, who was in love with her, and little Willie, who was likewise devoted to her. The reader who wishes to study the details as seen by a romantic writer may turn to the pages of Sir Walter Scott’s <i>The Abbot</i>. Sober historians do not accept this legend at its face value. They incline to believe that the lady of Lochleven and her son Sir William, the castellan, may have been less innocent than they appeared, and that the pretty tale of the method of escape was merely devised to excuse Mary’s guardians for deliberate negligence. But why should we dispel this last romantic glow in the life of Mary Queen of Scotland and the Isles? Already clouds were gathering on the horizon; her most adventurous days were over, and for the last time in her life did this young woman inspire and feel the emotion of genuine love.
         </p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394723-00013">Having been escorted by Lord Seton from West Niddry to Hamilton Castle, which was to be the headquarters of her faction, by the end of a week Mary Stuart found herself leader of an army of six thousand men. It seemed, for a time, as if all might go well with her, and as if the stars in their courses were fighting for her. Not merely had the Huntlys, the Setons and the Hamiltons rallied to her cause, but, in addition, large numbers of the Scottish nobility and gentry—eight earls, nine bishops and more than a hundred lairds. This was strange, and yet not so strange as it might seem at first sight, for in Scotland no one ever became an effective ruler without arousing rebellion against him among the nobility. The Lord Regent’s strictness had had the customary result. The blue blood of Scotland would rather serve under a tender queen, were she a hundred times a murderess, than under the severe and stubborn Moray. The foreign world was hastening to congratulate the liberated Queen on the re-establishment of her rights. Beaumont, the French ambassador, sought her out to pay his respects to her as lawful ruler of Scotland. Elizabeth sent a special messenger to congratulate her cousin upon the joyful news of the escape. During the year of imprisonment her position would seem to have been greatly strengthened.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394723-00014">But, as if under stress of a premonition, Mary, generally courageous and eager for the fray, now shunned having recourse to arms. She would prefer a reconciliation with her half-brother, would be content with a semblance of monarchical power. If he would vouchsafe her that much, she would confirm him in the regency. As events were soon to show, the strength with which she had been animated while subject to the iron will of Bothwell had been dissipated by her subsequent hardships. All that she now craved for was liberty, peace and rest—these things and the semblance of majesty. But Moray was not inclined to make terms with her, and to rule by his half-sister’s grace. His ambition and Mary’s were children of the same father, and there were not wanting those who would strengthen Moray in his determination to resist. At the very time when Elizabeth was sending congratulations to Mary, Cecil was vigorously urging the Lord Regent to make an end of Mary Stuart and of the Catholic party in Scotland once and for ever. Moray did not delay. He knew that, so long as his sister was at large, there could be no peace in the realm. He wanted to deal roundly with the rebel lords and to make an example of them. With his usual energy he hastily assembled an army, less numerous than Mary’s, but better led and better disciplined. Without waiting for reinforcements, he marched from Glasgow. At the village of Langside, now a suburb of that great city, the issue between Stuart and Stuart, between Queen and regent, between brother and sister, was fought out on 13th May 1568.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394723-00015">The battle of Langside was brief but decisive. There was not, as there had been at Carberry Hill, prolonged parleying, with hesitation on either side. Mary’s riders boldly attacked the enemy forthwith. Moray, however, had chosen his position with care; the hostile cavalry was mowed down by a fierce fire before it could storm the hill, and Mary’s lines were broken by a savage counter-thrust. In three-quarters of an hour all was over. The Queen’s last army fled precipitately, abandoning its artillery, and leaving three hundred dead on the field.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394723-00016">Mary was watching the fight from a neighbouring eminence. As soon as she saw that the day was lost, she mounted and galloped away, attended by a few riders. Seized with panic, she had no thought of further resistance. She rode many, many miles without pause, as we learn from her letter to her uncle, the Cardinal of Lorraine. “I have suffered injuries, calumnies, captivity, hunger, cold, heat, flying—without knowing whither—fourscore and twelve miles across the country, without once pausing to alight, and then lay on the hard ground, having only sour milk to drink and oatmeal to eat, without bread, passing three nights with the owls.” Today in Scotland Mary’s weaknesses and follies have in great measure been forgotten by her people; they find excuses for her mad passion, and they remember her chiefly by the sad story of these last days of freedom and flight. Either they think of her as the prisoner at Lochleven Castle, or else as a weary woman galloping on and on through the darkness, braving all hazards rather than that of surrender to her foes. Thrice before had she made night-rides after this fashion: the first time with Darnley when she escaped from Holyrood; the second time in male attire from Borthwick Castle, being joined by Bothwell soon after she left, for their escape to Dunbar; the third time with George Douglas, from Lochleven to West Niddry Castle. Thrice before in this manner had she saved her freedom and her crown. On the present occasion she saved only her life.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394723-00017">Three days after the rout at Langside, Mary reached Dundrennan Abbey, near the town of Kirkcudbright on the Solway Firth. Here was the limit of her realm; thus far she fled like a hunted beast. For her, who had yesterday been a queen, there was no safe spot left anywhere in Scotland, no stronghold there to which she could return. In Edinburgh was the pitiless John Knox; there she would have to face the scorn of the mob, the hatred of the clergy and maybe the pillory and the stake. Her last army had been defeated, her last hope had vanished. Now she must choose. Behind her lay the kingdom she had lost; in front of her, the sea, with its trackless roads leading in every direction. She might return to France; she might cross the firth to England; she might make her way to Spain. She had been educated in France, had friends and relatives there, many who were fond of her, poets who had sung her praises, noblemen who had been her companions; once before this land had received her hospitably, had given her a splendid coronation. But for the very reason that she had been queen there, decked out with the glories of this world, the greatest lady in the land, she was unwilling to return thither as a beggar, as a petitioner, with torn clothing and tarnished honour. She could not endure to think of the sneering countenance of Catherine de’ Medici, of seeking alms, or of taking refuge in a convent. Nor was there anything more agreeable in the idea of entrusting herself to the tender mercies of Philip of Spain. Never would that bigot forgive her for having married Bothwell in accordance with the rites of the Protestant Church, and with the blessing of a heretical priest. Thus only one possibility remained open to her, not a choice but a necessity. She must take refuge in England. During the most hopeless days of her imprisonment, had not Elizabeth written to her encouragingly: “You can at any time count on the Queen of England as a true friend”? Had not her cousin solemnly promised to have her reinstated as Queen? Had not Elizabeth sent her a ring as a token, which Mary need only produce to be sure of sisterly aid?</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394723-00018">Too hastily, as always when she made important decisions, Mary now took one of the most momentous decisions of her life. Without any preliminary demand for safeguards, she wrote from Dundrennan Abbey to Elizabeth:</p> 
         <div class="block extract" id="rw-block-extract_394723-00001">
            <p id="rw-p_394723-00019"><i>You are not ignorant, my dearest sister, of the great part of my misfortunes; but those which induce me to write at present have happened too recently yet to have reached your ear. I must therefore acquaint you as briefly as I can that some of my subjects whom I most confided in, and had raised to the highest pitch of honour, have taken up arms against me and treated me with the utmost indignity. By unexpected means, the Almighty Disposer of all things delivered me from the cruel imprisonment I underwent; but I have since lost a battle, </i><i>in which most of those who preserved their loyal integrity fell before my eyes. I am now forced out of my kingdom, and driven to such straits that, next to God, I have no hope but in your goodness. I beseech you, therefore, my dearest sister, that I may be conducted to your presence, that I may acquaint you with all my affairs. In the meantime, I beseech God to grant you all heavenly benedictions, and to me patience and consolation, which last I hope and pray to obtain by your means. To remind you of the reasons I have to depend on England, I send back to its Queen this token of her promised friendship and assistance. Your affectionate sister, M R.</i>

         </div> 
         <p class="fp" id="rw-p_394723-00020">The die had been cast. On 16th May 1568, Mary embarked in a fishing smack, crossed the Solway Firth and landed at the little port of Workington in Cumberland. When Mary reached this turning point in her fate, she was not yet twenty-five years of age, and yet her life was finished. She had enjoyed all possible earthly splendours, climbed to all possible earthly altitudes, and plumbed life’s abysses. Within a brief space of time, amid fearful mental tension, she had experienced extraordinary contrasts, had buried two husbands, lost two kingdoms, undergone harsh imprisonment and, by the pathway of crime, had with renewed pride remounted the steps of the throne. These weeks, these years, had been weeks and years of flame, whose reflex shines down to us through the ages. Now the fires were burning low and the best of her had been consumed. What remained was but dross and ashes, poor vestiges of these magnificent ardours. As a mere shadow of her former self, Mary Stuart went forward into the twilight of her destiny.</p>
