         <p class="fp" id="rw-fp_394721-00001"><span class="dropcap">A</span><span class="sc">S THE BOTHWELL TRAGEDY</span> advances towards its climax, we are again and again reminded of Shakespeare. The resemblance of the situation to that of <i>Hamlet</i> is obvious on the face of it. In both cases we have a king who has been murdered by his wife’s lover; in both cases the widowed Queen shows unseemly haste in marrying her husband’s murderer; alike in the tragedy of real life and in the tragedy conceived by the playwright, we note the enduring consequences of a murder whose concealment and repudiation demand more effort than was requisite for the performance of the crime. Even stronger, even more striking, are the analogies between many scenes of Shakespeare’s Scottish tragedy and those of the historical tragedy in sixteenth-century Scotland. Whether wittingly or unwittingly, <i>Macbeth</i> was created in the atmosphere of the Mary Stuart drama; the happenings staged by Shakespeare’s imagination in Dunsinane Castle had previously been staged in fact at Holyrood Palace. In both cases, after the murder had taken place, there was the same isolation, the same oppressive spiritual gloom, the same ghastly festivals in which none dared to take pleasure and from which one after another slipped away because the ravens of black disaster were already circling round the house. Often we find it hard to distinguish whether it is Mary Stuart we are watching as she wanders by night through the apartments, sleepless, confused, tormented by pangs of conscience, or whether it is Lady Macbeth wailing: “All the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand.” Is it Bothwell, or is it Macbeth, who becomes harsher and more resolute after he has committed his crime; who more and more boldly challenges the enmity of Scotland—though he knows well enough that his courage is futile, and that ghosts are stronger than a living man? In both cases alike, a woman’s passion is the motive power, but the man is appointed to do the deed; as extraordinarily similar are the atmospheres, the oppression that lours over the tormented spirits, husband and wife chained together by the crime, each dragging the other down into the same dark abyss. Never in history or in literature have the psychology of assassination and the mysterious power exerted after death by a victim upon a murderer been more magnificently depicted than in these two Scottish tragedies, one in the realm of fable and the other in that of real life.
         </p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394721-00001">Are such remarkable similarities the product of chance? Have we not good ground for assuming that, in <i>Macbeth</i>, Shakespeare was dramatising and sublimating the tragedy of Mary Stuart? The dramatist was three years old when the tragedy of Bothwell and Mary Stuart was played; he was a man of forty when he wrote <i>Macbeth</i>. The impressions of childhood exert an ineffaceable influence upon a poet’s mind, genius transmuting stimuli that have acted in childhood into imperishable realities. We cannot doubt that Shakespeare had been informed about the happenings in the palace at Holyrood. In his youth at Stratford he must have heard many details and legends about the Scottish Queen who had thrown away her kingdom and her crown in pursuit of a frenzied passion, and who, in punishment, had been imprisoned in one English castle after another. In 1587 Shakespeare had already been in London for a year, a play-actor, and probably trying his prentice hand as playwright, when the bells in the London churches pealed to announce that at length the head of Elizabeth Tudor’s chief adversary had been cut off, and that Henry Darnley had dragged his unfaithful wife down to join him in the tomb. When, in Holinshed’s <i>Chronicles of England, Scotland and Ireland, </i>the dramatist came to read the story of the Thane of Cawdor who slew Duncan and usurped the crown of Scotland, may we not suppose that he interwove his memories of the tragical fate of Mary Queen of Scotland and the Isles into the substance of his drama? We cannot, indeed, either affirm or deny that Shakespeare, in writing his tragedy, was influenced by his knowledge of the life and death of Mary Stuart. This much, however, is certain, that only those who have studied and understood the psychology of Lady Macbeth after the murder of Duncan will be able fully to understand the moods and the actions of Mary Stuart during those dark days at Holyrood—to understand the torments of a woman strong of soul, who was yet not strong enough to face up to the darkest of her deeds.
         </p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394721-00002">The most amazing part of the resemblance between the two tragedies, that conceived by the playwright and that recorded by historians and biographers, is the resemblance in the changes which took place in Mary Stuart and in Lady Macbeth after the crime had been committed. Before the murder Lady Macbeth had been a loving, warm-hearted, energetic woman, strong of will and fired by ambition. Her supreme desire was to help the man she loved and lift him to greatness, and she might have penned many of the lines from Mary Stuart’s sonnet: “<i>Pour luy ie veux rechercher la grandeure</i> …”—I want to seek out greatness for him.
         </p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394721-00003">Ambition supplies her with abundant energy until the deed. Lady Macbeth is crafty, shrewd and resolute while the crime is still only willed, proposed and planned, while the hot, red blood has not yet flowed over her hands and over her soul. With cajoling words like those used by Mary to lure Darnley to Kirk o’ Field, she lures Duncan into the bedchamber where the dagger is awaiting him. But immediately after the crime she becomes a different woman, losing both strength and courage. Conscience burns within her like a furnace. Delirious, with rigid gaze, she wanders through the rooms of the castle, a horror to her friends and a terror to herself. Her brain is overwhelmed by one desire, the longing to forget, the morbid yearning for surcease from thought, the craving for death. So was it, likewise, with Mary Stuart after Darnley’s murder. She had been completely transformed, not only in mind, but in aspect as well, so that Drury, one of Elizabeth’s spies, reported to his royal mistress that never, without a severe illness, had a woman changed in outward appearance in so brief a time and so remarkably as had the Queen.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394721-00004">There was nothing now about her to recall the cheerful, talkative, self-confident woman she had been only a few weeks before. She was silent, and shunned company. Perhaps, like Macbeth and Lady Macbeth, she continued to hope that the world would be silent if she herself were silent, and that the black waves would recede. But when questioning voices became urgent; when, at night, from the streets of Edinburgh, the names of the murderers were shouted up at her windows; when Lennox, her slain husband’s father, and Elizabeth, her enemy, and Seton, her friend, made common cause with the rest of the world in insisting that the criminals must be called to account, she lost her head. She knew that she must do something to hide the crime, to exculpate herself. But she lacked the will for defence, and could not find words that would be convincing though deceptive. As if in a trance, she listened to the voices from London, from Paris, from Madrid, and from Rome, exhorting her and warning her, but none of them could awaken her from her stupor. She listened to them only as one buried alive might listen to the footsteps of those who passed by his grave—defenceless, impotent and despairing.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394721-00005">She knew that it was incumbent upon her to play the sorrowful widow, to shed the tears that might make people believe her innocent. But her throat was dry as well as her eyes; she could not speak and could not dissemble. Things went on in this way for week after week, until at length she could bear no more. As a hunted beast turns at bay, as Macbeth, seeking safety, added new murders to the murder which was already clamouring for vengeance, so Mary Stuart at length threw off her intolerable inertia. No longer did she care what the world thought of her, and whether her actions were wise or foolish. Movement had become essential to her, speedier and speedier movement, to outrun the warning and the threatening voices. On! On! Anything now but stillness and reflection, for self-communings forced her to recognise that no skill could save her. One of the mysteries of the human mind is that, for a brief time, speed can overcome anxiety. Just as a coachman who feels and hears the bridge breaking down beneath his carriage flogs his horses into the gallop which can alone rescue him from the danger, so Mary Stuart spurred the black charger of her destiny onward in her despair, hoping to outrun her thoughts, to escape from her own criticism. Neither to think nor to know nor to hear nor to see any more; only on and on into frenzy! Better a terrible end than terror without end. Just as a falling stone drops with a steadily accelerating velocity as it plunges deeper into the abyss, so do people act more hastily and more foolishly when they can see no issue from their troubles.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394721-00006">Mary Stuart’s actions during the weeks after the murder cannot be explained on reasonable grounds, but only as the outcome of unconquerable anxiety. One would have thought that even in her frenzy she might have told herself that she was flinging her honour to the winds and exposing herself to universal condemnation. That all Scotland, all Europe, would regard her marriage to the murderer of her husband within a few weeks of the crime as an outrage. If she had spent a year, or better two years, in retirement, since memories are short, the world might have forgotten. Then, by adroit diplomatic manoeuvres, various reasons might have been found for her choice of Bothwell as husband. But Mary was flying towards destruction when, without a decent interval of mourning, she was in such haste to set her murdered husband’s crown on the murderer’s head. Yet this was the crazy course she took.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394721-00007">Only one explanation of such behaviour is possible in the case of a woman who, in general, was shrewd and tolerably circumspect. Mary Stuart was under duress. Manifestly she could not wait, because waiting would disclose a shameful secret. To anyone with insight into such matters it must have been obvious that the only explanation of the way in which Mary rushed into marriage with Bothwell was that the unhappy woman knew herself to be with child. She knew herself to be with child, not with a posthumous son of King Henry, but with the fruit of an adulterous passion. A queen of Scotland must not give birth to an illegitimate child, least of all under conditions likely to proclaim from the housetops her complicity in her husband’s murder. For in that case it would inevitably be disclosed how voluptuously she had passed with her lover what should have been the days of her mourning for her husband, and even a poor reckoner could have counted up the months to decide whether Mary had become Bothwell’s mistress shortly before or shortly after the murder of Darnley. Either supposition would have been equally disgraceful. Nothing but a prompt legitimisation through marriage could save her child’s honour, and perhaps to some extent her own. If she were already Bothwell’s wife when the child came into the world, pre-conjugal relations with him might seem excusable. In any case the infant would bear Bothwell’s name, and Bothwell would know how to defend its rights. Not a month, not a week, must be lost. It was a horrible choice by which she was faced, but no doubt it seemed less shameful to her to marry in haste the murderer of her husband than to bring a fatherless child into the world. Only on such a supposition does the apparent unnaturalness of Mary’s behaviour during these weeks become comprehensible. Other interpretations serve merely to obscure the picture. At all times women suffering from this particular dread have been driven by it to foolish and criminal deeds. Mary, the Queen, was but one among millions of her sex rendered distraught by an unwelcome maternity. No other theory can explain the insensate, the tragical haste of her marriage to Bothwell.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394721-00008">She was in a dreadful situation, and no demon could have imagined a crueller one. On the one hand, knowing herself to be with child, she was in a desperate hurry; but this hurry proclaimed her complicity in Darnley’s murder. As Queen of Scotland, as widow, as a woman of the highest rank and station, watched closely by Edinburgh, by Scotland, by the whole European world, Mary must have known that so notorious a man as Bothwell, universally regarded as the murderer of Darnley, was the last whom she ought to marry; but, as a helpless woman, she knew him to be her only saviour. She ought not to marry him, and yet was compelled to marry him. That the real cause for haste might not be disclosed, some other reason for a speedy wedding must be invented. A pretext must be found which would outweigh the legal and moral objections to the proposed union.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394721-00009">But how can a queen be constrained to marry a man of lower degree? The code of honour of those days recognised only one possibility in such a case. If a woman had been forcibly robbed of her honour, it was the violator’s duty to re-establish her honour. Only if, as a wife, she had been raped, could Mary Stuart find the glimmer of an excuse for marrying Bothwell. Only in that case could the illusion be diffused among the populace that she had not married Bothwell from free will, but under compulsion of the inevitable.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394721-00010">So fantastic a plan for escape could appeal only to a woman in a blind alley. Nothing but madness could engender such madness. Mary, who in general was courageous and resolute at decisive moments, shrank back when Bothwell proposed this tragical path to her. “I wish I were dead, for I see that all will turn out ill,” she wrote in her distress. But whatever moralists may think about Bothwell, he always remained a splendidly bold desperado. Little did he care that before the eyes of Europe he had to parade himself as a shameless robber, the ravisher of a queen, a villain who heeded neither law nor morals. Though the gates of hell should yawn in his path, he was not the man to hesitate when there was a crown to win. He was not appalled by any danger, resembling in this Mozart’s Don Giovanni who jeeringly invited the statue of the murdered Commander to the death feast. Beside him shuddered his Leporello, his brother-in-law Huntly who, for a few sinecures, had just consented to his sister’s divorce from Bothwell. Huntly, being less stalwart, soon took fright, hastened to the Queen and tried to dissuade her from the proposed venture. Bothwell, who was ready to defy a world in arms, was not troubled by the defection of this confederate. Nor did it affright him that the plan for the abduction of Mary had probably been blown upon. (In actual fact, one of Elizabeth’s spies reported the scheme to London in a dispatch sent the day before it was carried into effect.) Nor did it matter to the Earl whether the abduction would be regarded as genuine or spurious, so long as it brought him to his goal, the kingship. His only law was his own will, though death and the devil stood in the way; and he had power enough over Mary to drag her whithersoever he pleased.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394721-00011">Once more we learn from the Casket Letters that Mary was inwardly rebellious to the harsh will of her new lord and master. She had an inkling that this fresh deception would not impose upon the world. Still, as before, she obeyed him to whom she had surrendered her will. As submissively as when she helped to lure Darnley to Edinburgh, so, though with a heavy heart, she lent herself to the proposed “abduction” and, scene after scene, the comedy of this collusive rape was carried out, strictly according to plan.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394721-00012">On 21st April 1567, only nine days after the extorted acquittal of Bothwell, two days after, at the famous supper party in Ainslie’s Taverne, Bothwell had compelled most of the Scottish lords to consent to the proposed marriage; exactly nine years and two days since Mary’s betrothal, or “handfasting”, to the Dauphin of France in the great hall of the Louvre—the Queen, who had hitherto shown little maternal affection, was seized with an urgent desire to visit her little son at Stirling. The Earl of Mar, guardian of Prince James, gave her a suspicious welcome, for all sorts of rumours had come to his ears. Mary was not allowed to see her baby boy alone, since the Scottish lords were afraid of her kidnapping James and handing him over to Bothwell. It had become plain that she no longer possessed any will of her own, and would, without demur, carry out the most criminal instructions of her tyrant. If there had been any idea of such a kidnapping, it was frustrated by Mar’s caution.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394721-00013">After seeing her son, Mary rode back towards Edinburgh, attended by only a few riders, among whom were Huntly and Lethington, undoubtedly parties to the plot for her “abduction”. When the Queen and her train reached Almond Bridge, between Linlithgow and Edinburgh, six miles from the capital, she found Bothwell, with eight hundred cavalrymen, blocking her way. This overwhelmingly superior force “attacked” the Queen’s troops. Of course there was no fighting, for Mary Stuart, “wishing to avoid bloodshed”, forbade her attendants to resist. It was enough for Bothwell to seize the bridle of her palfrey for the Queen to “surrender”, and allow herself to be led off to the desired captivity at Dunbar. An over-zealous captain, who wished to set out for reinforcements and try to “rescue” the “prisoner”, was given a broad hint that Mary was a consenting party to the capture. Huntly and Lethington were dismissed unhurt. No one was to be injured in this “affray”. The only thing necessary was that Mary herself should remain in the “custody” of her beloved ravisher. For more than a week ensuing she shared his bed at Dunbar, while simultaneously in Edinburgh, with great haste (and with wheels greased by corruption), Bothwell’s divorce from his wife was carried through the ecclesiastical courts, both Protestant and Catholic. As far as the former were concerned, the shabby plea was put in that Bothwell had had adulterous relations with a serving maid. The Catholic court made the belated discovery that his marriage with Lady Jane Gordon was null and void because the pair were related in the fourth degree. At length this dark business was over. Then the world could be informed that Bothwell had carried off the unsuspecting Mary with the strong hand, and had raped her at Dunbar. Nothing but marriage to the man who had possessed her against her will could restore the honour of the Queen of Scotland.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394721-00014">This “abduction” was too obviously accordant with the wishes of those concerned for anyone to believe that the Queen of Scotland had really been “carried off by force and raped”. Even the Spanish ambassador, who was well affected towards Mary, reported to Madrid that the whole affair had been playacting. Strangely enough, however, it was those who were best in a position to see through the pretence that now behaved as if the alleged abduction and rape had been genuine. The Scottish lords, who had meanwhile already signed a bond for the removal of Bothwell, made a grotesque pretence of taking the comedy of the abduction seriously. With a touching display of fidelity they protested themselves enraged because the Queen of their country had been seized and detained against her will, to the dishonour of Scotland. With unwonted unanimity they declared themselves ready, as loyal subjects, to rescue the helpless lamb from the clutches of the wicked wolf Bothwell. Both-well had at length given them a long-desired excuse for, under the mask of patriotism, attacking the military dictator. They hastily got together to “rescue” Mary from his clutches, and thus prevent the marriage which, only a week earlier, they had agreed to promote.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394721-00015">Nothing could have been more distressing to Mary than this sudden determination of her “loyal” nobles to protect her against her “ravisher”. They were plucking from her hands the cards she had so carefully and deceitfully arranged. Since she had no wish to be “liberated” from Bothwell, but desired to be bound to him for ever, she now found it necessary to make short work of the lying statement that Bothwell had carried her off by force. Whereas yesterday she had wanted to blacken him, today it was incumbent on her to whitewash him, and thus to destroy the whole effect of the farce she had been playing. To prevent any serious charge being brought against Bothwell, she became the most zealous defender of the ravisher. His behaviour had, indeed, “been rather strange at first; but since then he had given her no grounds for complaint.” As no one had assisted her to resist the abduction, she had been “compelled to modify her first disinclination and to give serious attention to his proposal.” More and more deplorable grew the situation of this unhappy woman, entangled in the thorny thicket of her passion. The last veils were stripped from her, leaving her naked to the scorn of the world.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394721-00016">It was with consternation that Mary’s friends watched her return to Edinburgh in the beginning of May. Bothwell was leading her horse by the bridle, and to show that she came with him of her own free will, his spearmen were ostentatiously unarmed. Vainly did those who honestly wished well to Mary Stuart and to Scotland warn the Queen of the error of her present courses. Du Croc, the French ambassador, told her that if she married Bothwell, this would put an end to the friendship with France. One of her most trusty adherents, Lord Herries, threw himself at her feet, imploring her to think better of what she was doing; while Sir James Melville, as ever a loyal and sagacious adviser, had to flee from the wrath of Bothwell when, at the last moment, he tried to hinder this unhappy marriage. All her adherents were heavy-hearted because this splendid woman was in thrall to a dastardly adventurer, and they foresaw that the mad haste with which she was wedding the murderer of her husband would lose her both her crown and her honour. Good days had dawned for her opponents. The gloomy prophecy of John Knox was being disastrously fulfilled. John Craig, who had succeeded Knox as minister at St Giles’, refused at first to have the banns published in the kirk. He openly stigmatised the marriage as “odious and slanderous before the world”. Not until Bothwell threatened him with the gallows did he lend himself to promoting the marriage.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394721-00017">Mary, however, had to bow her neck lower and lower beneath the yoke. For now, when everyone knew how urgently the Queen needed this marriage, she was shamelessly blackmailed by those whose help and approval were requisite. Huntly demanded and secured the return of all the estates that had been escheated to the crown, this being his payment for consenting to his sister’s divorce from Bothwell. The Catholic bishop received manifold offices and dignities; but the highest price was demanded by the Protestant minister, who insisted upon the Queen’s public humiliation. Since the urgency of her need was well known, she was compelled to declare that she, a Catholic princess, on the maternal side a descendant of the Guises, would have her marriage celebrated in accordance with the Reformed, that is to say heretical, rites. By acceding to this demand, Mary Stuart flung away the last card which might have enabled her to secure the support of Catholic Europe and to retain the favour of the Pope, the sympathies of Spain and France. Henceforward united Catholicism would be against her. Terribly true had become the words of the sonnet:</p>

         <p id="rw-p_394721-00019">It will be hard to find in the pages of history a more painful description of a wedding than that of Mary’s third marriage on 15th May 1567; the picture is one of the utter debasement of an unhappy queen. Her first marriage, to the Dauphin, afterwards Francis II of France, had been a resplendent occasion. Tens of thousands had acclaimed the young bride who was Queen of Scotland and was to be Queen of France. From far and wide the nobility of France, the envoys of all lands, had assembled to watch the Dauphiness’ progress to Notre Dame, attended by the royal family and the flower of French chivalry. The second marriage had been a quieter affair. No longer at high noon, but between five and six o’clock in the morning, the priest had wedded her to the great-grandson of Henry VII. Still, the Scottish nobles had been on hand, and the foreign ambassadors likewise, while the good people of Edinburgh kept high festival throughout the day. But this third marriage, that to Bothwell—who at the last moment had been created Duke of Orkney—was perpetrated as secretly as a crime. In the small hours (four o’clock), when the city was still asleep, a few persons assembled, almost furtively, in the old chapel of Holyrood. It was not three months since Darnley’s murder, so his widow was married in her “dule-weed”<i>—</i>her mourning garb. The chapel was almost empty. Numerous guests had been invited, but few of them wished to grace the occasion by their presence, or to see the Queen of Scotland accept a wedding ring from the hand of him who had slain Darnley. Almost all the Scottish lords had stayed away, with or without excuse. Moray and Lennox had left the country; Lethington and Huntly, who were half in the plot, absented themselves; and the only man to whom, as a devout Catholic, Mary had hitherto been able to disclose her most secret thoughts, even her father-confessor, had taken leave of her for ever. Her spiritual director had sadly acknowledged that he regarded her henceforward as lost. No one in whom there persisted a spark of honour wished to witness the marriage of Darnley’s murderer to Darnley’s widow, or the alleged consecration of this crime by religious rites. Fruitlessly had Mary implored the French ambassador to be present so as to give the wedding a semblance of respectability. Du Croc, her good friend, steadfastly refused to attend. His presence would have signified the assent of France. “Had I gone, one might have believed that my King had had a hand in these affairs.” Besides, he did not wish to recognise Bothwell as the Queen’s consort. The marriage service was read by Adam Bothwell, Bishop of Orkney, assisted by the Reverend John Craig. No Mass was said, no organ sounded, short work was made of the ceremony. No arrangements were made for a dance or a banquet that evening. Nor, as when Mary had wedded Darnley, was money scattered among a rejoicing crowd, with cries of “Largesse, largesse!” The capital was as cold, as empty and as chill as a new-made grave, and the few witnesses of this strange wedding were as mournful and silent as mutes at a funeral. There was no procession through the streets. The wedded pair hastened from the doleful chapel to lock themselves up in the privacy of their own apartments.
         </p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394721-00020">For, at the very moment when, after blindly straining forward to her goal, Mary had achieved her purpose, she underwent a spiritual collapse. She had fulfilled her wish of making Bothwell her own. Up to the hour of the wedding she had persisted in the illusion that a union with him, the formal sanctification of their love, would rid her of her anxieties. But now, when she no longer had a purpose to fulfil, no object on which to fix her gaze, her eyes were opened and she stared round her—into vacancy. Discord between the pair seems to have begun directly after the wedding. As invariably happens when two persons have dragged one another down towards destruction, each was inclined to blame the other for what had gone awry. On the afternoon of the wedding day, du Croc, who visited Mary at her request, found her in despair. Night had not yet fallen, but a chill spectre had arisen to separate Mary from Bothwell. “Repentance has already begun,” reported the French ambassador to Paris. “When I went to see Her Majesty on Thursday afternoon, I noticed something strange in the manner of her and her husband, which she sought to excuse—saying that if she was sad, it was because she wished to be so, and she never wished to rejoice again. All that she wished for was death. Yesterday, while she and her husband were together, shut up in their cabinet, she cried out aloud for a knife with which to kill herself. Those who were in the outer chamber heard her. They fear that unless God comes to her aid she will, in her despair, do herself a mischief.” Soon there were other trustworthy reports of dissension between the newly wedded pair. Bothwell, indeed, was said to regard the divorce from his pretty young wife, Lady Jane Gordon, as invalid, and spent nights with her instead of with Mary. “From the day of the wedding,” reports du Croc once more, “there was no end to the fears and the plaints of Mary Stuart.” Now that the blinded woman had forced the hand of fate, she knew that all was lost, and that death would be better than the life of torment she had brought upon herself.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394721-00021">This ghastly honeymoon endured for three weeks and was a time of agony throughout. Whatever the pair tried to do in the hope of holding together and of saving themselves proved futile. When in the public eye, Bothwell, indeed, made a parade of respect and affection for the Queen, feigning love and humility; but his words and gestures counted for nothing in view of his dreadful record. The populace was gloomy, and looked askance at the pair of criminals. Vainly did the dictator, since the nobles held aloof, woo the favour of the commonalty, playing the liberal, the kindly, the pious ruler. He attended the services of the Reformed Church, only to find that the Protestant clergy were as hostile to him as the Catholic. He wrote humbly worded letters to Elizabeth, which she left unanswered. He wrote to Paris, but his epistles were ignored. Mary summoned the Scottish lords, but they held aloof in Stirling. She demanded the custody of her child, but the Earl of Mar refused to surrender little James to her care. A horrible silence surrounded the Queen and Bothwell. To give the semblance of security and cheerfulness, Bothwell hastily improvised a masque and a regatta. This water pageant was held at Leith, and Mary graced it with her presence, to watch her consort ride at the ring and review the troops. Wanly she smiled at her spouse. The common folk, always ready for a show, assembled in great numbers, but did not rejoice. The country seemed paralysed with fear, which was likely, in a moment, to blaze up into wrath.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394721-00022">Bothwell was not the man to be carried away by sentiment. An experienced seaman, he could read the signs of a coming storm. With inveterate resolution he prepared to meet all hazards. He knew that his enemies aimed at his life, and that matters would soon be decided by an appeal to arms. Hastily, therefore, he sharked up what riders and foot soldiers he could, in order to be prepared to resist attacks. Mary sacrificed everything left to her in order to aid him in paying his mercenaries; she sold her jewels, borrowed such moneys as she could, and at length (though this was a grievous affront to the English Queen) decided that the silver-gilt font Elizabeth had sent her for little James’s christening should be committed to the melting pot in the hope of prolonging the agony of her own rule. In threatening silence, however, the Scottish lords gathered together, enveloping the palace like a thunderstorm which might at any moment shoot forth its lightnings against the royal pair. Bothwell was too familiar with the cunning of his erstwhile associates to trust the semblance of tranquillity. He knew well enough that they were planning to strike him out of the darkness, and he would not await their onslaught in unfortified Holyrood. On 5th June, barely three weeks after the wedding, he and Mary rode from Edinburgh to the stronghold of Borthwick, a few miles south of the capital in the direction of the border, where his principal strength lay. There Mary, as a last hope, issued a summons for 12th June, addressed to her “subjects, noblemen, knights, esquires, gentlemen and yeomen”, who were to assemble under arms, provided with a week’s supply of food. Obviously Bothwell designed, by a sudden attack, to strike down his enemies before they had gathered their own forces.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394721-00023">But this flight from Holyrood gave the Scottish lords courage. Hastily they moved upon Edinburgh, occupying the capital without resistance. Sir James Balfour, who had been Bothwell’s chief assistant in the murder, was ready and willing to betray his confederate, so that a couple of thousand riders were able to gallop off to Borthwick to seize Bothwell before he could get his troops together and equip them for battle. Bothwell, however, would not allow himself to be taken like a wild beast in a snare. He jumped out of a window before the main body of his enemies under Morton and Hume arrived on the scene, and spurred away, leaving Mary behind. The Scottish lords did not, at this juncture, venture to use arms against their Queen, being content with the attempt to persuade her to detach herself from Bothwell. She, however, was still in thrall to her ravisher. During the night, hastily dressing herself as a boy, she mounted her horse and, soon joined by her husband, rode with him to Dunbar, leaving all else in order to live or die with Bothwell.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394721-00024">One little sign ought to have convinced the Queen that her cause was lost. For on the day of her flight from Edinburgh to Borthwick Castle there suddenly disappeared, “without leave-taking”, her last adviser, Maitland of Lethington, the only man who, during these weeks when she had been distraught by passion, had continued to show some degree of loyalty. Lethington had followed his mistress a long way on the gloomy descent to ruin, and perhaps—Bothwell apart—no one had done more than he to weave the net of murder around Darnley. But now he felt that the wind had changed and was blowing in full force against the Queen. A typical diplomatist, one of those who always trim their sails to the breeze of power, he would no longer help in a cause he knew to be lost. While the ride to Borthwick was in progress, he quietly turned his horse and rode back to join the other side. The last rat had deserted the sinking ship.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394721-00025">Mary was unteachable; she could be neither intimidated nor warned. In this astonishing woman danger served only to intensify the courage that gave her greatest follies a romantic glamour. Reaching Dunbar on horseback, in male attire, she found there no royal robes, no harness, no equipment. What matter? This was not the time for courtly state, now that war had been declared. From a woman of the people she borrowed a feminine outfit—“a red petticoat, with sleeves tied with points, a partlet, a black velvet hat and a muffler.” Little did she care if her appearance was unqueenly, so long as she could ride beside the man who was all that remained to her on earth, and for whom she had sacrificed everything. Bothwell quickly mustered what forces he could. The “subjects, noblemen, knights, esquires, gentlemen and yeomen” had failed to assemble. Scotland was no longer loyal to its Queen. With two hundred mercenary harquebusiers as shock troops and a rabble of poorly armed peasants and borderers (not more than about twelve hundred men in all) on 14th June the Queen and Bothwell rashly abandoned Dunbar and set forth to attack Edinburgh. The insignificant army was driven onward by the sturdy will of the Earl, who hoped to take the Scottish lords by surprise. He knew that foolhardiness can sometimes save a situation in defiance of reasonable calculation.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394721-00026">At Carberry Hill, six miles from Edinburgh, on Sunday, 15th June, the two rabbles (they are not worthy the name of armies) came face to face. The Queen’s troops, now swelled by reinforcements to three thousand five hundred, outnumbered those of her enemies. But few of the lords of the realm, few of the nobility and gentry, were fighting under the royal banner of the Scottish lion. Except for the before-mentioned harquebusiers (mercenaries) the Queen’s main supporters were Bothwell’s moss-troopers, whose lust for battle was almost wholly in abeyance. Less than half a league away, on the other side of the stream, were the forces of her adversaries, well mounted gentlefolk, adequately armed and trained for combat. The standard under which they were prepared to fight was a strange one for those who had been accomplices in the late King’s murder. It was of white silk, and upon it was painted the dead body of Darnley, with the infant James praying before it, in the words: “Judge and avenge my caus, O Lord!” Thus the very men who had participated in the slaying of Darnley now wished to represent themselves as Darnley’s avengers, and to proclaim themselves as having taken up arms only against his murderer, not in rebellion against the Queen.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394721-00027">The two banners fluttered bravely in the wind. But there was no bravery in the hearts of those who formed either body of combatants. Neither side would advance to the attack across the burn. Both parties stood watching one another warily. Bothwell’s borderers had no mind to let themselves be slaughtered for a cause beyond their understanding. The Scottish lords, on their side, had certain scruples which rendered them unwilling to use spears and swords against their rightful Queen. To bring a monarch to his death by a cleverly devised hole-and-corner conspiracy, thereafter to hang a few poor devils of the lower orders and solemnly proclaim their own innocence—little matters of that sort did not occasion them any pricks of conscience. But in open day to assail a sovereign ruler conflicted with the feudalist notions which still swayed their minds.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394721-00028">Du Croc, the French ambassador, present on the battlefield as a neutral observer, did not fail to notice that neither side was eager for the fray, and therefore hastened to offer his services as mediator. Under a flag of truce, with an escort of fifty horse, the Frenchman crossed the brook to parley with Bothwell and the Queen.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394721-00029">It was a strange audience. Mary, who had been accustomed to receive the French ambassador beneath a royal canopy, and robed in court attire, was sitting on the stones, clad as aforesaid, with a short kilt which barely covered her knees. But she was no less dignified, no less proud, than if she had been in full panoply of state. She could not master her wrath. As if she were still queen of the situation as she was still virtually Queen of the country, she demanded that the Scottish lords should immediately make their submission. The lords, she said, had formally acquitted Bothwell, but now they were accusing him of the murder. They had asked her to marry Bothwell, and now dared to make a crime of her having done so. No doubt, in these respects, Mary’s indignation was justified, but the hour of right had passed, and the hour of might had come. While Mary was parleying with du Croc, Bothwell rode up. The ambassador saluted him, but did not shake hands. Now Bothwell had his word to say. He spoke clearly, and without reservations. Not a shade of fear troubled his audacious countenance. Du Croc himself had, unwillingly, to admit the unshaken courage of the desperado. “I must acknowledge,” wrote the ambassador in his report to the King of France, under date 17th June 1567, “that I saw in him a great warrior, who spoke with self-confidence, and was well able to lead his followers boldly and skilfully. I could not but admire him, because he was well aware that his enemies were resolute, and that he could not count upon the fidelity of a bare half of his own forces. Nevertheless he was undismayed.” Bothwell proposed that the issue should be decided by single combat between himself and anyone of equal rank whom his enemies chose to appoint. His cause was just, and God would be on his side. Banteringly he told the Frenchman to watch the proposed duel from a neighbouring hillock. That would be good sport. The Queen, however, would hear nothing of the proposal. “No, no,” she interposed, “I will not suffer that; I will fight out the quarrel by his side.” She still hoped that her enemies would submit to her authority. A born romanticist, she was now, as ever, lacking in the sense of reality. Du Croc speedily realised that his mission was fruitless. The fine old fellow would gladly have helped the Queen if he could, and the tears came to his eyes, but so long as she stood by Bothwell there was no hope for her. Farewell, then. He bowed courteously, turned his horse and rode slowly back to the Scottish lords.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394721-00030">The parley was finished. It was time for the battle to begin. But the rank and file had better sense than their leaders. They saw that the great men had been conversing amicably. Why should poor wretches shoot one another or cut one another down on such a fine afternoon? Bothwell’s soldiers idled about, and when Queen Mary, as a last hope, ordered them to attack, they refused to advance. They had been loafing on the hillside for six or seven hours, and now the little force began to crumble away. As soon as the lords perceived this, they dispatched two hundred cavalrymen to cut off Bothwell’s and the Queen’s retreat. Mary saw the danger and, being still a woman in love, she thought not of her own danger but of Bothwell’s. She knew that none of her subjects would lay a hand on herself, but that his enemies would not spare him, for Bothwell left alive might betray things which these belated avengers of Darnley would not like to have made public. For the first time in her life, therefore, she mastered her pride. She sent a messenger under a flag of truce to Kirkcaldy of Grange, asking him to come alone for a parley.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394721-00031">Reverence for the sacred command of a monarch had a magic effect. Kirkcaldy of Grange halted his riders. He went alone to Mary Stuart and, before saying a word, he knelt to pay homage. Then he stated his conditions. The Queen must leave Bothwell and return with the Scottish lords to Edinburgh. Bothwell could ride whithersoever he pleased. No one would pursue him.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394721-00032">Bothwell (a wonderful scene, and a wonderful man!) stood looking on without a word. He said nothing to Kirkcaldy nor yet anything to the Queen to influence her decision. One cannot but feel he was ready to ride alone against the two hundred who were waiting at the foot of the hill, prepared, at a wave of Kirkcaldy’s hand, to charge the hostile lines. Only when he heard that the Queen had agreed to Kirkcaldy’s proposal did Bothwell step to her and embrace her—for the last time, though neither of them knew this. Thereupon he mounted his horse and galloped off, followed only by a couple of servants. The dream was over, and the time of awakening had come.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394721-00033">The awakening came, dreadful, inexorable. The Scottish lords promised to conduct Mary back to Edinburgh with all due honour, and it is probable that such had been their intention. But hardly did she, seated on her jennet and wearing lowly attire, begin to ride through the ranks of the common soldiers, when, fired with scorn, they venomously reviled her. So long as the iron hand of Bothwell had protected the Queen, the hatred of the populace had been kept in restraint. Now, when she was no longer thus safeguarded, contempt broke forth. A queen that had capitulated was no longer a queen to these rebel soldiers. They thronged round her more and more closely, inquisitively at first, then challengingly, with shouts of “Burn the whore! Burn the murderess!” Kirkcaldy laid about him with the flat of his sword, but in vain. More and more of the rebels closed around her, and held aloft, full in her sight, the banner demanding God’s vengeance upon Darnley’s murderer. This unroyal progress, this running of the gauntlet from Carberry Hill to Edinburgh lasted from six in the evening until ten. The populace thronged from the villages and from all the houses of the city to enjoy the spectacle of a captured queen. Again and again the press became so great that the ranks of the soldiers were broken. Never did Mary Stuart suffer a more profound humiliation than on this day.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394721-00034">But this proud woman might be humiliated; she would not bend. As a wound does not burn fiercely until it is cleansed, so Mary did not really feel her defeat until she was faced by this poison of scorn. Her hot blood, the blood of the Stuarts, the blood of the Guises, boiled. Instead of behaving prudently, she railed at the lords, holding them responsible for her contumelious treatment by the people. Like an angry lioness she roared at her enemies; she would hang them, would have them crucified; and suddenly she seized the Earl of Lindsay’s hand, saying: “I swear, by this hand which is now in yours, that I will have your head.” As always, in times of danger, her excess of courage led her into folly. Although the Scottish lords now had her safe in their hands, she openly used the most abusive language against them, expressing the utmost contempt for their misbehaviour, instead of maintaining a prudent silence or trying to win her subjects over by cajolery.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394721-00035">Probably her rage made the lords harsher than they had at first intended to be. At any rate, now that they felt she would never forgive them, they did their utmost to make the unruly woman feel her defencelessness. Instead of installing their Queen in the palace of Holyrood, which lay without the city walls, they compelled her to ride past Kirk o’ Field into Edinburgh, where the streets were filled with the rabble. There, through High Street, she was led to the provost’s house, as if to the pillory. The door was locked upon her. Not one of her noblewomen or servantmaids was admitted. A night of despair followed. For days she had not changed her clothes. Since the morning she had not had a morsel of food. Terrible had been her sufferings from sunrise to sunset—a period in which she had lost her kingdom and her lover. Outside in the street there assembled, as before a wild beast’s cage, a foul-tongued mob, to shout words of the coarsest opprobrium. Not until now, when the lords believed that her spirit was broken, did they try to negotiate with her. They did not ask much. Their only demand was that she should break away from Bothwell for ever. But the defiant woman could fight more boldly for a lost cause than for a hopeful one. Contemptuously she rejected their proposal, and one of her adversaries admitted later: “Never have I seen a more valiant woman than was the Queen on this occasion.”</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394721-00036">Since the Scottish lords could not by any threat induce Mary to forsake Bothwell, the cunningest among them tried to gain the same end by craft. Maitland of Lethington, her old and at one time her faithful adviser, used finer means. His appeal was to her jealousy, for he told her (perhaps it was true, perhaps false; who knows since the words were uttered by a diplomatist?) that Bothwell had been unfaithful to her, that during the few weeks of their marriage he had resumed intimate relationships with his divorced wife, had told Lady Jane Gordon that he regarded her as his lawful spouse and the Queen as no more than a concubine. But Mary knew that she was surrounded by cheats, none of whose words were to be trusted. The information served only to drive her into a frenzy, with the result that Edinburgh saw the degrading sight of the Queen of Scotland behind barred windows with her dress torn, her breasts exposed, her hair hanging down, raging like a maniac, sobbing and shrieking, while she declared to the populace, touched in spite of frenzied hate, that it was their duty to free her, since she was being kept in duress by her own subjects.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394721-00037">The situation had become impossible. The Scottish lords would have been glad to yield a step or two. They felt, however, that they had now gone too far to retreat. It had become impossible for them to dream of reinstalling Mary Stuart in Holyrood as Queen. Yet they could not leave her in the provost’s house, surrounded by a raging mob, without incurring formidable responsibilities and arousing the anger of Elizabeth and all other foreign princes. The only man among them who had both courage and authority, Moray, was across the border. In his default, the other lords did not venture to come to a decision. The best they could do was to remove the Queen to some safer retreat, and for this purpose they selected Lochleven Castle. That stronghold was on an island in the lake of the same name. It belonged to Margaret Douglas, Moray’s mother, who would naturally not be too well disposed towards the daughter of Mary of Guise, for whom her lover James V had forsaken her.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394721-00038">The ominous word “imprisonment” was carefully avoided in the lords’ proclamation. The Queen was only “secluded” that “the person of Her Majesty might be kept from any communication with the aforesaid Earl Bothwell, and that she might not get into touch with those who wished to safeguard him from the just punishment of his crime.” The measure they adopted was a half-measure, a provisional measure, dictated by fear and prompted by an uneasy conscience. The rising against Queen Mary did not yet venture to declare itself a rebellion. All the blame was still laid upon the fugitive Bothwell. The secret determination to dethrone Mary was hidden away under cowardly though courteous words. To humbug the populace, which was still clamouring for judgement and execution of the “whore”, on the evening of 17th June Mary Stuart was conveyed to Holyrood under a guard of three hundred men. But as soon as the citizens had gone to bed, a little procession was formed to conduct the monarch to Lochleven. This gloomy ride lasted until dawn. In the twilight of dawn, when the waters of the lake were beginning to show themselves more clearly, she approached the solitary, inaccessible fortress where she was to stay, who knew how long? She was rowed thither, and the gates clashed to behind her. The passionate and gloomy ballad of Darnley and Bothwell was finished. Now began the melancholy envoy, the chronicle of perpetual imprisonment.</p>
