Whoever in Europe happened to be heir to a throne, or king and unwedded, sent an official wooer to these unmated queens. The Houses of Habsburg and Bourbon, Philip II of Spain, his son Don Carlos, the Archduke of Austria, together with the Kings of Sweden and of Denmark, old men and young, dotards and striplings, became aspirants for one or the other of these two fair hands. Never had the political marriage market been so glutted with suitors. The reason was a good one, for by wedding a lady of royal birth and lineage, who was in addition Queen in her own right, a man might extend his power and his lands in a perfectly legitimate manner. For, during the heyday of absolutist rule, it was easier to build up a nicely rounded-off kingdom by way of marriage than through war. By such means had France become a united whole; Spain, a worldwide empire; the dominion of the Habsburgs, an enlarged and consolidated realm. Unexpectedly now England and Scotland, the last precious and unannexed crown-jewels of Europe, offered themselves as alluring prizes. Elizabeth Tudor and Mary Stuart were unwedded. Whoever could win either southern or northern Britain by a lucky conjugal deal would become winner in the game of world politics and, concomitantly with success in the struggle of the nations, would gain a prize helping to decide the great religious issues of the epoch.
         </p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394713-00001">This was an important point at the time; for if either queen were to wed a Catholic, the British Isles, influenced by the religious faith of such a royal consort, would load the scales in favour of Rome, so that the struggle raging between Protestantism and the old belief might very well be settled to the advantage of the <i>ecclesia universalis</i>. Thus the mad chase that presently ensued was of far wider import than a mere pleasant opportunity for securing conjugal bliss; the future of the western world was at stake.
         </p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394713-00002">For the two young queens, however, it was in addition a matter which concerned them personally to the end of their days, since a decision one way or the other would necessarily seal their fate. Should one of the ladies make a better match than the other, the balance of power would turn in her favour and her rival’s throne lose in value and prestige. An appearance of friendship between Elizabeth and Mary was possible only so long as both were single; the former must remain Queen of England and Ireland, while the latter must remain Queen of Scotland and the Isles, if an equable poise were to be maintained. In the event of the scales being loaded to the profit of one or the other, the successful princess would become the more powerful of the two, and thus she would become the victor. The two queens pitted pride against pride, neither wishing to yield ground to the other. A life-or-death struggle, therefore, took place between them, and death alone was able to unravel the terrible entanglement.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394713-00003">As stage-manager for this superb drama Dame History selected herself, and she chose for her star performers two women of outstanding talent and personality. Both Mary Stuart and Elizabeth Tudor were exceptionally gifted for the parts they were allotted. Their energy and vitality were in crass contrast with the ineptitude of the other reigning monarchs of the period: Philip of Spain was monkish and bigoted; Charles IX of France was a mere boy, extremely weak and possessing queer tastes; Ferdinand of Austria was utterly insignificant—none of those kings attained the high stage of intellectual development which these women reached. Both were shrewd, though their shrewdness was often hampered by passion or by feminine caprice; both were inordinately ambitious; both, from earliest childhood, had been trained and educated for the great roles they were destined to play. Their outward decorum was exemplary, and they were cultured ladies, their minds having absorbed all the humanities of the day.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394713-00004">In addition to the mother tongue, they conversed fluently in Latin, French and Italian. Elizabeth, moreover, had a fair command of Greek. So far as the art of letter-writing was concerned, their style greatly excelled that of their best ministers in flexibility and freshness of expression, Elizabeth’s being more full of colour and more picturesque and metaphorical than that of Cecil, her secretary of state, whereas Mary’s was more polished and showed greater originality of thought and choice of words than that of Maitland of Lethington or Moray. The intelligent interest they took in the arts, the beautiful ordering of their courtly lives, have stood the test of centuries; Elizabeth had her Shakespeare and Ben Jonson, while Mary encouraged and admired Ronsard and du Bellay. But once having enumerated these manifold outward resemblances between the two women, we have to realise that the list is exhausted. Inwardly they were totally unlike. Their spiritual and temperamental contrast has at all times lured dramatic authors into the endeavour to portray them.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394713-00005">The aforesaid contrast made itself felt throughout their respective careers. It was one of circumstance as well as of character. Here is a first and notable difference—Elizabeth had a hard time of it at the opening of her life, whereas Mary’s closing years were heavy with disaster and shrouded in gloom. Mary Stuart rose to power and good fortune lightly, brilliantly and quickly like the morning star in a clear sky; a queen already in the cradle, when hardly more than a child she was anointed a second time as aspirant to a second throne. But her fall was as precipitate as her ascent. Her destiny became concentrated in three or four catastrophic happenings, genuine drama which has for ever made of her the quintessential heroine of tragedy. Elizabeth Tudor, on the other hand, rose to greatness slowly and with difficulty. Her career therefore takes, rather, an epic form. No spontaneous gifts were conceded her. As a child she was declared a bastard; she was confined to the Tower by her sister’s orders; she was threatened with execution; by cunning and precociously developed diplomatic arts, she succeeded in procuring a bare living for herself and at least a tolerant outlook on her mere existence as a human being. Whereas Mary had from the outset dignities and honours showered upon her, Elizabeth was compelled to fight her way upward and to mould her life for herself.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394713-00006">Two such fundamentally diverse characters were fated to lead their possessors in the long run down utterly divergent paths. At times these paths might intersect, might cross one another, but they could never pursue the same direction, so that the two women were prohibited from ever bearing one another company and becoming true friends. The contrasts between them bored deep down into essentials—one was born with a crown as she was born with her own hair; the other had slowly and patiently to work her way upward and was hard pressed to retain power when achieved. From these contrasted origins the queens as they passed from childhood to girlhood and thence to womanhood were compelled to cultivate their own, individual strength and qualities. Mary Stuart had versatility, attained her goal without effort, possessed a certain lighthearted frivolity of mind, and almost a surplus of self-confidence, so that she adventured much—and this made her great though it brought about her undoing. With head erect, and proudly, she stepped forward to meet what life had to offer, feeling her position to be impregnable. God Almighty had bestowed a throne upon her and no one could snatch the gift out of her hands. She was born to command, the rest of mankind had to obey; even if the whole world doubted her regal rights, she felt that these were ineradicably planted in her blood and bone. Life meant to dare much and to enjoy everything to the full, to go forth in search of a unique and passionate hazard. She would allow herself to be suggested into enthusiasms, thoughtlessly, quickly, and would make up her mind with the fiery intensity of a man affronted who seizes upon his sword. Just as, dauntless horsewoman that she was, she would urge her steed over hedges and ditches, risking life and limb, so in the sport of politics she imagined she could ride roughshod over every obstacle and difficulty. What Elizabeth looked upon as a carefully thought-out game of chess, a diplomatic issue demanding the utmost intellectual exertion, was for Mary a delightful entertainment, an enhancement of joy in life, a chivalric tourney. The Pope once said of her that she had a man’s soul in a woman’s body. Her daring frivolity and egotism—characteristics which make excellent material for poesy and ballad, and feed the tragic muse—doomed the young sovereign to an early fall.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394713-00007">Now Elizabeth was a practical realist through and through; her knowledge of what was feasible amounted almost to genius. She won her victories by way of a shrewd utilisation of thoughts she had long digested in her mind, and by turning the vagaries of her rival to good account. With her clear, sharp and birdlike eyes—one needs but glance at her portraits to realise how bright and penetrating they were—she looked with mistrust upon the universe of men and things around her, for she recognised the dangers which beset her, and her heart was filled with fear. Early in life she had passed through the school of adversity, and had learnt caution and the art of moderation. Statesmanship could never be practised extempore—that she had been taught well—it needed prolonged calculation and immense patience. Nothing lay further from her purpose than the bold, the over-bold feeling of security which was a virtue in Mary, but a virtue that led to her ruin.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394713-00008">As a child Elizabeth had witnessed the rise and fall of Fortune’s wheel; she had seen how short a step was needed to bear a queen from throne to scaffold; she had seen that one day a person might be languishing in the Tower of London—that antechamber of so many deaths—and the next would be making a royal progress to Westminster. Power seemed to her a fluid substance in the hands of a ruler; it might slip unawares through the fingers, and a position of security would thereby be endangered. The crown and sceptre appeared to her made of fragile glass, and consequently she held them in her grasp with the utmost precaution and anxiety. Her whole life was filled with care and irresoluteness.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394713-00009">All the portraits of the Queen confirm the traditional descriptions of her aspect and character. None of them show her to have been lucid, free and proud, like a born ruler of men. She always looks timid and anxious, with strained eyes, as if watching and waiting for something untoward. We never see a smile of glad self-confidence on her lips. Simultaneously shy and vain, the wan countenance peeps forth from behind the make-up and from among the glittering jewels. We feel that whenever she was alone, having doffed her robes of state and wiped the rouge from her wasted cheeks, there could have been no royal dignity left—nothing but a poor, solitary, uneasy, prematurely aged woman, the tragical figure of one who, far from being competent to govern a world, was unable to master even her own urgent distresses.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394713-00010">The attitude she assumed lacked any vestige of the heroic, and her everlasting hesitation, postponement and want of determination robbed her of much of her queenly dignity. Nevertheless, Elizabeth’s indubitably great capacity for statesmanship lifted her to a higher plane than that of romantic heroism. Her power resided, not in venturesome plans and decisions, but, rather, in a tough and circumspect persistence for obtaining the utmost that was compatible with security, with scraping and pinching where state expenses were concerned, and in the cultivation of such virtues as are habitually ascribed to burgesses and housewives worthy of their salt. Her very faults—timidity, excess of caution—bore fruit in the political field.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394713-00011">Mary lived for herself; Elizabeth lived for her country, contemplating her position as ruler through the spectacles of a realist and looking upon it as a profession. Mary’s mind was stuffed with romance, and she accepted her queenly estate as a gift from God and as exacting no duties on her part. Both women were strong and both were weak, but their strength and their weakness assumed different aspects. Whereas Mary’s madly heroic self-confidence led her to her doom, Elizabeth’s weakness, her lack of decision, led her in the end to victory. For in the world of politics persistence invariably gains the day over undisciplined strength, carefully prepared plans triumph over improvisations, practical realism gets the better of unpractical romanticism.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394713-00012">But the antithesis went even deeper. Elizabeth and Mary were not only poles apart as queens; they were equally different in feminine qualities. It was with them as if Nature had set about deliberately to create two figures whose make-up was diametrically opposed, down to the smallest details.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394713-00013">Mary Stuart as woman was wholly woman, first and last and for always, so that the greatest decisions forced upon her during her brief span took their shape from this deepest spring-head of her being. Yet it would be far from true to say that impulse invariably governed her reason, or that she allowed herself to be driven unresistingly hither and thither by her passions. Quite otherwise. In early youth Mary proved amazingly reserved in all that appertained to the exercise of feminine charm. Year followed upon year, and the life of feeling still slumbered quietly within her. What portraits have come down to us show a friendly, gentle, rather weak and indolent face, a slightly disdainful pair of eyes, an almost childishly smiling mouth. Indeed, this countenance is that of an undifferentiated being, an immature woman. Essentially sensitive, she would blush on the slightest provocation, or she would turn pale with emotion, and tears came readily to her eyes. Thus the abysses of her nature lay undisturbed until her time was ripe; in a few words, she was a thoroughly normal and genuine woman, and it was not until a later date that she herself, Mary Stuart, was to discover her real depths, her real strength, in a passion of love that was to be the only true passion of a lifetime. But this merely serves to prove how feminine was her character, how much a thing of impulse and instinct, how firmly it was chained to her sex. For in her brief moment of ecstasy all her higher cultural attainments seemed to vanish as a dream; all the dams of courtly training, of morals and of royal dignity were broken down, and when she saw herself confronted by a choice between passion and honour, her queenship was set aside to give place to the woman who chanced to sit upon a throne. The regal mantle slipped easily from her shoulders and she stood naked and unashamed as do so many other women who yield to the ardours of love, who allow themselves to be swept off their feet and swallowed up in their desire. This is it, perhaps, which lends so much splendour to her story—for the sake of one rich moment of passionate accomplishment she was capable of risking kingdom, power and sovereign dignity.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394713-00014">Elizabeth, however, was quite incapable of yielding to such a complete abandonment of herself. The reason for this was a physiological one—she was “not like other women”. Nature had not only debarred her from motherhood, but had further deprived her of the possibilities for enjoying the emotions and resulting acts of a woman in love. This secret organic inferiority lay at the root of all the strange evolutions and spasmodicities of her temperament. Not voluntarily, as she pretended, but perforce, did she remain a “virgin queen”. Even though some of the statements, such as Ben Jonson’s, that have come down to us regarding her physical malformation are open to question, there can be no doubt that passionate fruition was for her rendered impossible by bodily or mental hindrances. Obviously such circumstances must profoundly affect a woman’s character. The scintillations, the vacillations, the moodiness of her nerves; her weathercock behaviour, which frequently assumed the aspect of hysteria; her lack of balance and the incalculability of her resolves; her unceasing swing from hot to cold, from Yes to No; the comedies she played, her finesse and her reserve, and (not least) that coquetry which wrought such tricks with her statesmanlike dignity—one and all, these things are hardly explicable except as the outcome of bodily defect. Wounded as she was by it to the core of her being as woman, she could neither feel, nor think, nor act unambiguously and naturally; no one could count upon her, and even less could she count upon herself. Nothing could be more wrong-headed, superficial and commonplace than the customary view (to which Schiller gives the weight of his authority) that Elizabeth played a cat-and-mouse game with the gentle and defenceless Mary. Though mutilated in spirit because abnormal in body, though her nerves were always on edge, though an unscrupulous intriguer, Elizabeth was neither cruel, inhuman, cold, nor hard. One with insight can discern in this woman, freezing on her solitary throne, hidden sources of warmth. Though her relations with her half-lovers were a torment to her, because to none of them could she give herself wholly, we can see behind her whimsies and outbursts of temper an earnest wish to be magnanimous and kind. She detested bloodshed. The signing of a death warrant was a misery to her. She took no pleasure in the murderous chances of war. One of her amiable vanities was a desire to be regarded by the world as the noblest, the most glorious, the humanest of monarchs, and to astonish her adversaries by unexpected clemency. Violence was foreign to her timid disposition. She loved the petty, pin-prick arts of diplomacy, and to act irresponsibly behind the scenes. When she had to declare war, she hesitated and shuddered. Any strenuous resolve cost her sleepless nights, and she devoted her best energies to maintaining peace for her country. If she showed enmity to Mary Stuart, it was only because she felt the latter’s existence to be a menace to her own life and authority; yet she avoided open conflict, being by nature a trickster rather than a fighter. Both the cousins, Mary Stuart from indifference, Elizabeth Tudor from timidity, would have preferred the maintenance of a spurious peace. But the stars in their courses were set against the untroubled existence of this pair side by side in the same firmament. The stronger will of history is regardless of the innermost longings of individuals, often involving persons and powers, despite themselves, in her murderous game.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394713-00015">For behind these personal differences of character and disposition there loured, like huge and menacing spectres casting their shadows over the destiny of the British queens, the gigantic opposing forces of the epoch. Mary Stuart was the champion of the old Catholic faith; Elizabeth Tudor constituted herself the defender of the Reformation. The two queens symbolised two antagonistic eras, two antagonistic outlooks upon the universe; Mary incorporating that which was dying out, the Middle Ages, the days of chivalry; Elizabeth being the embodiment of the new, the coming time. Thus the birth pangs of a fresh turn in history came to be suffered in the struggle that ensued between these cousins.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394713-00016">What imparted so much picturesqueness and romance to Mary Stuart was that she stood or fell with the past, that she was a last and dauntless paladin of a cause that lay already in the death agony. She was merely obeying the directive will of history when she rallied to the side of those who still had their gaze fixed upon the past, when she made political pacts with those powers which had already declined from the zenith of their influence, when she allied herself with Spain and the papacy. Elizabeth looked ahead; she was far-sighted, sending her envoys into distant lands, into Russia and Persia for example, encouraging her subjects to explore oceans and continents, just as if she foresaw that on a day to come the foundations of the new world that was in the making must be laid in other continents than Europe. Mary was perfectly happy to remain fixed in what had come to her by inheritance, and she could not disentangle her mind from the dynastic conception of sovereignty. God had given power and dominion to potentates that they might reign supreme at the apex of an earthly hierarchy. What could terrestrial justice do against so divine an ordinance? There was no room for criticism, for resistance; a king’s subjects and his territories were his private possessions. It is an actual fact that Mary Stuart twice tried to transfer her royal inheritance, once to France and the second time to Spain. She considered that the territory of Scotland and the Isles belonged to her as ruler, but she failed to recognise that such a relationship is mutual—that a sovereign belongs to the country over which he or she rules. During all the years of her reign, Mary was nothing but Queen of Scotland, she never acted as Queen for Scotland’s benefit. From the hundreds of letters which issued from her pen we learn only that she desired to consolidate and extend her personal rights, never that she had the folk-wishes at heart, or envisaged some betterment in commerce, in navigation, or even in the armed forces of the crown. Just as, when she wrote poetry or entered into an interesting conversation, she invariably lapsed into a foreign idiom, the courtly French she had been taught in childhood and youth, so did her thoughts and feelings never clothe themselves in the Scottish, the national phraseology. She did not live and, ultimately, die for Scotland; all her thoughts were concentrated on remaining Queen of Scotland. Mary Stuart never gave anything creative to the land of her birth except the saga of her life.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394713-00017">So strong a sentiment of being above everyone and everything necessarily created a solitude around Mary. Though she far exceeded Elizabeth in courage and determination, her cousin gained daily in strength during the struggle because of wider vision and more disciplined shrewdness. The English Queen surrounded herself with quiet and clear-thinking personalities, a kind of general staff of able advisers from whom she learnt the arts of strategy and tactics, thus protecting herself from herself, where great decisions were concerned, against her own fitfulness and caprice. So splendid an organisation did she create around her that even to this day it is well-nigh impossible to disentangle her personal achievements from those of the collectivity of statesmen who served during the Elizabethan epoch; moreover the immeasurable renown which haloes her name includes the lives of her helpers. Mary Stuart was Mary Stuart, and nothing more; whereas Elizabeth was Elizabeth plus Cecil, plus Leicester, plus Walsingham, plus the superlative energies of all her subjects. It is hard to distinguish how far she was personally responsible for the rise of the English nation, and how far the nation itself worked its way to so vast a predominance, bearing the Virgin Queen aloft on its sturdy shoulders. England and Elizabeth formed one united whole. Elizabeth set an example to the monarchs of her day and of subsequent epochs, in that she never arrogated to herself the position of ruler of England, but assumed the more modest role of administrator, of carrier-out of the folk-will, of servitor to the national mission; she understood the trends of the epoch that was emerging from an autocratic regime into a constitutional regime. Honestly and voluntarily, she recognised the new forces that were at work transforming the estates of the realm, and widening the world frontiers by far-flung geographical discoveries; she knew how to encourage the guilds, the merchants, the financiers and even the privateers and filibusters of her day, to superhuman efforts on behalf of England, so that England might become Queen of the Seas. Repeatedly did she renounce her personal wishes (a thing Mary Stuart could never bring herself to do) in order to serve the general desires of the nation she was called to govern.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394713-00018">To save herself from spiritual shipwreck, Elizabeth had to find an outlet in creative endeavour. Because as a woman she was frustrated, she sublimated her feminine inferiority into the happiness and welfare of her people. Her egoism, her passionate desire for power, her realisation that never could she become a mother or the dearly beloved of a man, were transfigured into a national ambition, a longing to see her country great. Her lack of personal triumph could be compensated for by England’s victory. The sublimest of her vanities was to be made great in the eyes of posterity through England’s greatness, in which she would posthumously live. Whereas Mary would have gladly exchanged her throne for a better one, Elizabeth had no longing for any other crown than that of England. Mary Stuart wanted to be resplendent here and now; Elizabeth Tudor, the thrifty, the far-sighted, devoted her best powers to the future of her nation.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394713-00019">It was natural, therefore, that the favour of war should fall to the woman who was in advance of her time, who possessed a talent for looking ahead, while Mary Stuart, the Queen who still believed in the moribund days of chivalry and romance, was left in the lurch. In the person of Elizabeth the will of history found expression, for the will of history is always straining forward, leaving the empty shells of outlived forms behind, and seeking renewed strength in other creative activities. The whole energy of a nation was incorporated in Elizabeth’s person, for the nation behind the Queen wished to become conqueror of the globe. With Mary Stuart the past died a chivalrous, a magnificent, a heroic death. Thus both women remained victors in the field of their choice—Elizabeth, the realist, conquered in the realm of history; whereas Mary, the romanticist, has conquered in the realm of poetry and legend.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394713-00020">The choice of figurantes was indeed majestic both in space and time; unfortunately the manner in which the tragedy was fought to a finish was petty and mean. In spite of their superlative traits these two women remained women throughout, and were unable to overcome the weaknesses inherent in their sex. Thus, instead of dealing honestly with one another, they entered into paltry intrigues, and by their lack of frankness fostered enmities. If, instead of Mary and Elizabeth, two kings had been faced by the same circumstances, they would have come to a firmer decision, declared war, countered one dark threat by another, set courage against courage. The struggle between Mary and Elizabeth, however, never came to a stout and clear issue; it was “catty”, each lying in wait for the other with claws covered but ready for use; it was a thoroughly unloyal and dishonest game.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394713-00021">For a quarter of a century these two women consistently lied to one another and betrayed one another, without for a moment either of them being effectively humbugged. They had no illusions about one another. Their correspondence, in which each of the “dear sisters” bespatters the other with asseverations of inviolable affection, makes one’s gorge rise by its hypocrisy. While the two sovereigns are smiling graciously at one another and exchanging congratulations, each is secretly sharpening a knife to slit the other’s weasand. They never look one another candidly in the eyes, never engage in bold and open struggle. The story of the duel between Elizabeth Tudor and Mary Stuart contains no word about Homeric combats or glorious situations. We seem to be reading a chapter from Machiavelli, an account of clever and even dazzling manoeuvres and counter-manoeuvres, psychologically most exciting, but morally repulsive because it was always malice confronting malice and never courage confronting courage.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394713-00022">This mutual hanky-panky began with the negotiations for Mary’s second marriage. Royal suitors appeared upon the scene, and one was as good as another to Mary, for the woman in her was not yet awakened and she was not fastidious. Don Carlos, a lad of fifteen, would do well enough, although rumour described him as an ill-natured madcap. Nothing amiss with Charles IX of France, another minor. Young or old, attractive or repulsive, their personalities were of no moment to her provided the marriage would obviously give her a higher standing than her Tudor cousin. Being thus dispassionate, Mary was content to leave the bargainings to James Stuart, who proved a selfishly zealous go-between, for if his half-sister could be married, and then dispatched to wear a crown in Paris, Vienna or Madrid, he would be quit of her, and once more become uncrowned King of Scotland.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394713-00023">Elizabeth, however, being well served by her spies across the border, was promptly informed about these various suitors, and hastened to interpose a veto. She wrote in plain terms to her ambassador in Edinburgh to the effect that, should Mary accept a husband of royal blood from Austria, France or Spain, she (Elizabeth) would regard this as an unfriendly act. Yet the same courier carried the most affectionate letters to “my dear cousin”, who is to trust Elizabeth alone, “no matter what mountains of happiness and earthly splendour others may promise you.” Of course Elizabeth had not the slightest objection to a Protestant prince, to the King of Denmark or the Duke of Ferrara. In plain English, she had no objection to a suitor who would be valueless, and therefore not dangerous. The best thing would be, however, for Mary to look “at home” for a husband, to wed some member of the Scottish or English aristocracy; in that case she could rely on Elizabeth’s friendship, be certain of her help.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394713-00024">Elizabeth was obviously playing foul. What the unwillingly “virgin queen” wanted was to spoil her rival’s chances of a good match. Mary returned the ball no less adroitly. Of course she did not admit for an instant Elizabeth’s overlordship, Elizabeth’s right of veto in this matter of marriage. But before saying as much in plain terms, she wanted to make sure of a bridegroom of her own choice, and Don Carlos, the leading candidate, still hung in the wind. To gain time, Mary therefore feigned heartfelt thanks for Elizabeth’s kindly interest. “Not for all the uncles in the world” would she risk losing the English Queen’s valuable friendship by precipitate and headstrong action. She was honestly desirous of following her dear cousin’s advice. Elizabeth need only tell her explicitly which suitors were to be regarded as “allowed”. This pliability was most touching, but in the midst of declarations of confidence Mary interspersed a timid enquiry as to how Elizabeth proposed to compensate her for being so docile. Well and good, she writes (substantially), I shall be guided by your wishes, and shall be careful not to marry any man of so high a rank that my position, well-beloved sister, will overshadow yours. But, in return, please be good enough to let me know how things stand with regard to my right of succession to the English crown!</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394713-00025">Therewith the conflict had got back to the old dead point. As soon as Elizabeth was asked to say a plain word about the succession, no god was mighty enough to wring a plain word from her. She resorted to circumlocutions. “Being wholly devoted to the interests” of her dear sister, she would work on behalf of Mary as on behalf of her own daughter. The mellifluous words streamed on for page after page; but the one, the clear, the decisive utterance that was wanted was not forthcoming. Like two Levantine merchants, each waited for the other to make a move; neither wanted to be the first to open the hand. “Marry the suitor I propose to you,” said Elizabeth in effect, “and I shall appoint you my successor.” “Appoint me your successor, and I will marry whomsoever you please,” rejoined Mary. But because each of them wished to overreach the other, neither would trust the other.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394713-00026">The negotiations concerning the marriage, the suitors and the right of succession dragged on for two years. Strangely enough, these women, who were both, so to say, cheating at cards, unconsciously played into one another’s hands. Elizabeth’s supreme purpose was to restrain Mary from marriage; and Mary, unfortunately, was mainly bargaining with the most slow-moving of the monarchs of his day, Philip II Cunctator. Not until there seemed to be an insuperable hitch in the chafferings with Spain, and one of the other conjugal possibilities had to be seriously considered, did Mary deem it expedient to make an end of her own policy of procrastination and to put a pistol to her dear sister’s head. She bluntly asked Elizabeth which member of the English aristocracy the latter had in mind for her as a husband.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394713-00027">Elizabeth never liked a plain question demanding a plain answer, and such a proceeding was particularly uncongenial in this instance. She had long been holding counsel within herself as to which among her nobles would be best suited for Mary, and she had ambiguously declared her determination to give her cousin someone whom none could expect. The Scottish court, however, said that these dark hints were incomprehensible, and pressed for a positive proposal, a specific name. With her back against the wall, Elizabeth could no longer evade the issue by unintelligible allusions. Through clenched teeth she allowed the name to escape her—Robert Dudley.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394713-00028">Now the diplomatic comedy seemed, for a moment, to be degenerating into farce. Elizabeth’s proposal must be regarded either as a monstrous affront or else as a stupendous bluff. According to the notions of the day, it was almost an outrage to ask the Queen of Scotland, who was also Queen-Dowager of France, to wed the subject of a sister queen, a man without a drop of royal blood in his veins. Still more preposterous was the actual personality of the chosen suitor, since it was common talk throughout Europe that for years Robert Dudley had been as near to becoming Elizabeth’s lover as was physically possible, so that now the Queen of England was suggesting as consort for the Queen of Scotland a man who was tantamount to a cast-off article of clothing for which Elizabeth had no further use. Earlier, no doubt, in the days of her liveliest passion for him, she had thought of marrying Dudley herself. She was bound by extremely intimate ties, half of friendship and half of love, to him who had been the companion of her youth during those fateful days in the Tower. Year after year she had irresolutely toyed with the notion (it was her way with notions); but when Dudley’s wife, Amy Robsart, died by an accident under highly suspicious circumstances, Elizabeth hastily withdrew from the scene in order to escape inculpation in the affair. Thus Dudley was compromised, first by the inexplicable strangeness of his wife’s death, and secondly by his notorious erotic relationship with Elizabeth, whose proposal of this castoff lover as husband for Mary was, perhaps, the most amazing of all the amazing deeds of the English Queen during her long reign.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394713-00029">It is not likely that we shall ever know every thought in Elizabeth’s mind when she brought forward this perplexing scheme. Who can fathom the wish-dreams of a woman of hysterical temperament, or formulate them in logical terms? Was she still honestly in love with Dudley, and did she wish (since she did not dare to marry him herself) to bestow upon him, as the most precious of possible gifts, the succession to her realm? Or did she merely want to rid herself of a gallant who had become a nuisance? Or did she fancy that by palming off a confidant on her ambitious rival she could keep Mary’s actions the better under control? Was she simply putting Dudley’s fidelity to the test? Did she entertain dreams of a persistent triangle, a <i>ménage à trois</i>? Or was the absurd suggestion made only in the firm conviction that Mary would refuse, and would thereby put herself in the wrong? All these possibilities are conceivable, and it seems even more probable that this capricious woman did not herself know what she wanted. It is likely enough that she was toying with the idea, just as she loved to toy with persons and with resolves. Futile to discuss might-have-beens, or to enquire, in this instance, what would have happened if Mary had seriously considered the acceptance of Elizabeth’s discarded lover. Perhaps in that event Elizabeth would have taken a sharp curve, would have forbidden Robert Dudley to marry the Queen of Scots, and thus would have heaped upon her rival the shame of a rejection following upon the shame of such a proposal.
         </p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394713-00030">To Mary the idea that she should wed anyone who was not of the blood royal seemed little short of blasphemous. In the first flush of anger she scornfully asked the English ambassador whether his sovereign lady could be in earnest when she put forward “Lord Robert” as suitor. Speedily, however, she mastered her indignation and assumed a friendly aspect, for it would be inexpedient to offend her dangerous adversary by a blunt refusal. If she could secure the heir to the Spanish or to the French throne as husband, this would be vengeance enough for Elizabeth’s insult. In Edinburgh, therefore, Dudley was not rejected as a possible suitor. Mary entered into the spirit of the farce, supplying to it an admirable second act. Sir James Melville was thereupon sent to London, ostensibly to negotiate about the Leicester marriage, but really that he might involve the complicated issues in a further tangle of lies and misrepresentations.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394713-00031">Melville, the most loyal and trustworthy of Mary’s courtiers, was a skilful diplomatist. He also wielded a facile and descriptive pen, for which posterity owes him thanks. His account of his visit to London has handed down to us the most vivid picture we possess of Elizabeth’s personality, and is at the same time an extraordinarily amusing historical comedy. Elizabeth was well aware that Sir James, a highly educated man, had lived for years at French and German courts, and she therefore set great store on making a good impression upon him, never suspecting that his infallible memory would enable him to set on record all her weaknesses and coquetries. In the case of Elizabeth Tudor, feminine vanity often played havoc with her royal dignity. So was it now when the Queen of England, instead of trying to produce a political effect upon the ambassador of the Queen of Scots, was mainly concerned to show off her airs and graces before the man. She strutted forth one antic after another. From her extensive wardrobe (after her death it was found to contain three thousand dresses) she selected the most expensive gowns, attiring herself by turns in the English, the Italian and the French fashions of the day; some of these costumes were cut so low in the neck as to effect an extremely liberal display; at the same time she showed off by turns her Latin, her French and her Italian, luxuriating in the courteous admiration of the ambassador. Still, none of his superlatives satisfied her conceit. It was not enough for Melville to assure her that she was beautiful, clever and well informed. In the spirit of the question, “Mirror, mirror on the wall, who is loveliest of us all?” she was eager to hear from Melville that he found her more admirable than his own sovereign lady, handsomer, abler, more cultured than even Mary Stuart. Pointing to her wealth of naturally curling red-gold hair, she asked him whether Mary’s locks were as splendid—a thorny question to put to a queen’s envoy! Sir James was equal to the occasion, declaring with the wisdom of Solomon that Elizabeth was “the fairest queen in England” and Mary “the fairest in Scotland.” But such praise was too half-hearted to gratify her foolish vanity. Again and again she paraded her charms, playing on the virginals and singing to the lute. At length Melville, whose business it was to lead his hostess by the nose in political matters, thought it expedient to admit that “the Queen of England was whiter”, that he “gave her the praise as the better performer on the lute and virginals”, and that his “Queen danced not so high and disposedly” as Elizabeth did.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394713-00032">Amid this peacocking, Elizabeth had forgotten the matter in hand. When, at length, Melville broached the thorny topic, the Queen, now wholly the <i>comédienne</i>, took a miniature of Mary out of a drawer and kissed it affectionately. With a thrill in her voice, she assured him how much she longed to become personally acquainted with Mary, her beloved sister (although in reality she had done everything in her power to hinder such an encounter); and anyone who was swept off his feet by this bold actress could not fail to believe that Elizabeth’s chief desire on earth was to make her Scottish neighbour happy. But Melville had a cool head and a clear vision; he was not taken in by these languishings and prevarications, for on his return to Edinburgh he reported: “Ther was neither plain dealing nor upricht meaning, but great dissimulation, and emulation, and fear.” When Elizabeth asked him point-blank what Mary thought of the Dudley proposition, the trained diplomat was equally careful to avoid a decisive No or an irrevocable Yes. He talked round the subject, saying that Mary had not yet given full attention to the possibility. But the more evasive the envoy, the more insistent the Queen, who remarked that Melville “appeared to make small account of my Lord Robert … but ere it were long she would make him Earl of Leicester and Baron of Denbigh,” and that Melville “should see it done before his returning home; for she esteemed the Lord Robert as her brother and best friend, whom she would have married herself if she had been minded to take a husband; but being determined to end her days in virginity, she wished that the Queen her sister should marry him, as meetest of all other, and with whom she might rather find it in her heart to declare her next in succession to her realm than with any other person; for, being matched with him, she would not then fear any attempts at usurpation during her own life.”
         </p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394713-00033">Actually, a few days later (third act of the farce), the promotion of Dudley thus announced took place with great pomp and ceremony. Lord Robert, under the eyes of the court, knelt before his sovereign and lady-friend, to be created Earl of Leicester. Once more, however, Elizabeth’s feelings ran away with her, and the woman in her played the Queen a prank, for, says Melville, while she was “herself helping to put on his ceremonials … she could not refrain from putting her hand in his neck to kittle him, smilingly, the French ambassador and I standing beside her.” What an amusing detail to report when he returned from his embassy!</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394713-00034">Melville had not come to London in order to divert himself as chronicler of a royal comedy; he played an independent role. His diplomatic portfolio had some secret compartments whose contents he was by no means inclined to disclose to Elizabeth, and his civil chatter with Her Majesty about the Earl of Leicester was only intended to camouflage the real objects of his journey south. The most important of these was to convince the Spanish ambassador that Mary Queen of Scots would not wait any longer for a decision in the matter of Don Carlos’ suit. Was it or was it not proposed that King Philip’s heir should marry her? Next, Melville was, with due discretion, to get into touch with a candidate of the second class, with Henry Darnley.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394713-00035">This stripling stood, for the moment, upon a loop line. Mary wished to hold him in reserve in case her chances of a better marriage should be frustrated. For Darnley was neither king nor prince, while his father, the Earl of Lennox, had been banished from Scotland as an enemy of the Stuarts, and the family estates had been sequestrated. On the maternal side, however, this young man of eighteen was of high descent, for he was of Tudor stock. As great-grandson of Henry VII, he was the first “prince of the blood” at the English court, and therefore of suitable rank to become consort of any queen in Christendom. As possible husband for Mary, he had the further advantage of being a Roman Catholic. Unquestionably then, Darnley could be considered third, fourth or fifth iron in the fire and Melville had a number of non-committal talks with Margaret Countess of Lennox, who was an extremely ambitious woman.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394713-00036">Now it is an attribute of genuine comedy that, though all the participants must best one another, they should not be wholly deceived, since from time to time each will get a momentary glimpse of the cards of one of the other players. Elizabeth, being no fool, never imagined that Melville had come to London solely in order to compliment her upon her hair and upon her touch on the virginals. She knew that the suitorship of her own cast-off lover was not likely to commend itself to Mary, and she was also acquainted with the ambitious designs of her dear cousin, Lady Lennox. No doubt, as usual, there were spies at work. During the ceremony at Westminster, when Robert Dudley was invested as Earl of Leicester, Elizabeth asked Melville what he thought of the newly created earl. Melville replied: “As he is a worthy subject, so he is happy in a princess that can discern and reward merit.” In his <i>Memoirs, </i>Melville continues: “‘Yet,’ said she, ‘ye like better of yonder long lad,’ pointing towards my Lord Darnley who, as nearest prince of the blood, bore the sword of honour that day before her.” Melville did not lose his nerve at this sudden invasion of one of the secret compartments of his portfolio. He would have been unworthy of his reputation as diplomatist had he not known how, on occasion, to lie like a trooper. Wrinkling his brows, and glancing contemptuously at the man with whom the day before he had been bargaining as Mary’s potential husband, he replied that “no woman of spirit would make choice of such a man that was liker a woman than a man, for he is lovely, beardless and lady-faced.” Sir James adds as comment: “I had no will she should think that I liked him, or had any eye that way.”
         </p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394713-00037">Was Elizabeth deceived by this feigned contempt? Did Melville’s adroit parry lull her suspicions to sleep? Or was she, throughout, playing a double game which to this day remains impenetrable? However this may be, the improbable happened. First the Earl of Lennox was granted leave to go to Scotland, and then, in January 1565, his son Henry Darnley. Strangely enough the go-between in securing these permits was none other than the Earl of Leicester, who had his own ends to serve, wishing to escape from the conjugal noose his royal mistress had spun for him. Now the fourth act of the farce could proceed merrily in Scotland, where, however, chance took a leading hand in the sport. The threads of the tangle were abruptly snapped, so that the comedy of the suitors was ended in a remarkable fashion which none of those concerned had expected.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394713-00038">For politics, a mortal and artificial power, was overridden on this January day of 1565, by an eternal and elemental force. The suitor who had come to woo a queen to his surprise found, in Mary Stuart—a woman. After years of patient waiting, she at length became aware of her own self. Hitherto she had been no more than a king’s daughter, a king’s wife, a queen and a queen-dowager—the sport of alien wills, a pawn in the game of diplomacy. At length, passion surged up from within. Ambition was discarded like a constricting garment. The awakened woman found herself confronted by a man. Therewith opened the history of her inner life.</p>
