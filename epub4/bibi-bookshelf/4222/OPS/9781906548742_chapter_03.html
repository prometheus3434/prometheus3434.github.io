Her rise to power was like a rocket for swiftness—six days after birth she was already Queen of Scotland; at six years of age she became the betrothed of one of the most powerful princes in Europe; at fifteen she was his wife; at sixteen, Queen of France. She reached the zenith of her public career before she had had time to develop her inner life. Things dropped into her lap as if out of a horn of plenty; never did she fight in her own behalf for a desired object, or reap any advantage through the exercise of personal endeavour. Not through trial and merit did this princess attain a goal; everything flowed towards her by inheritance, or grace, or gift. As in a dream, wherein happenings fly past in ephemeral and multicoloured precipitancy, she lived through the wedding ceremony and the coronation. Before her senses could begin to grasp the significance of this precocious springtime, the blossoms were already withered and dead, the season of flowering was over and Mary awoke disappointed, disillusioned, plundered of her hopes, fleeced as it were, bewildered to distraction. At an age when other maids are beginning to form wishes, are beginning to hope for and to hanker after they hardly know what, Mary experienced in profusion the possibilities of a triumphant progress without being granted time or leisure to grasp their spiritual significance. This premature coming to grips with destiny explains her subsequent restlessness and voracity. One who has so early been the outstanding figure in a country, indeed in the world, will never again be content with a less exalted position. It was in the stubborn fight to maintain herself at the centre of the stage that her real greatness was developed. Renunciation and forgetfulness are permissible to the weak; strong natures, on the other hand, are not in the habit of resigning themselves, but challenge even the mightiest destiny to a trial at arms.
         </p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394710-00001">In truth this brief period of royalty in France passed for Mary like a dream—a poignant, uneasy and anxious dream. The ceremony at the cathedral at Rheims—where the archbishop crowned the sickly youth, and where the lovely girl-Queen, bedecked with the jewels appropriate to her position, shone forth from among the nobles like a slender white lily not yet in full bloom—was an isolated occasion of splendour. Except for this the chronicles have nothing to tell of festivals or merry-making. Fate left Mary Stuart no time to found the troubadour’s court of the arts and poesy for which she yearned; left the painters no time to finish portraits of the monarch and his lovely wife in the panoply of royal robes; no time for historians to describe their respective characters; no time for the populace to make close acquaintance with its new rulers or learn to love them. In the long procession of kings and queens of France, the figures of these two children are driven onward like mist wreaths before the wind.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394710-00002">Francis II, a tainted tree in the forest, was doomed to premature death. In a round and bloated face, timid eyes, weary and reminding us of those of one who has been startled out of sleep, give the dominant expression to his countenance. His strength was further undermined by a sudden and extensive growth in stature such as often occurs at his age. Physicians watched over him sedulously and urgently advised him to take care of himself. But the boy was animated by a foolish dread lest he should be outdone by his willowy, untiring wife, who was passionately devoted to outdoor sports. That he might seem hale and manly he rode hell-for-leather and engaged in other exhausting bodily exercises. But nature could not be cheated. His blood was incurably sluggish, was poisoned by an evil heritage from his grandfather Francis I. Again and again he was laid low by paroxysms of fever. When the weather was inclement, he had to keep indoors, restive and bored, a pitiful shade, surrounded by his train of doctors. So weakly a king aroused more pity than respect among his courtiers; among the common people, on the other hand, it was soon bruited abroad that he was smitten with leprosy and that he bathed in the blood of freshly killed children in the hope of regaining health. The peasants regarded the stricken lad menacingly when he went out riding. At court, those with an eye to the future were beginning to throng round Catherine de’ Medici and Charles, the next heir to the throne. Hands so weak as Francis’ could not long nor firmly grip the reins of power. Now and again, in stiff, awkward writing, the boy would pen his “François” at the foot of decrees, but the real rulers were the Guises, the kin of Mary Stuart, in place of one whose energies must be devoted to keeping his vital spark aglow as long as possible. Such a sick-room companionship, with its perpetual watchfulness over failing health, can scarcely be spoken of as a happy marriage, even if we suppose it to have been a marriage in any true sense of the term. Yet there is nothing to justify the supposition that the union of these youngsters was an unhappy one, for even at this malicious court where gossip was rife, at this court where every <i>amourette</i> was recorded by Brantôme in his <i>Vie des dames galantes, </i>no suspicion seems to have been aroused by Mary Stuart’s behaviour. Long before they were dragged to the altar, Francis of Valois and Mary Stuart had been playmates, and it seems unlikely that the erotic element can have had much part in their companionship after the wedding. Years were still to pass before there was to develop in Mary Queen of Scots the capacity for passionate self-surrender to a lover, and Francis, an ailing boy, was not the type of male to arouse the passion hidden so deep in the enigmatic nature of his wife. Tenderness and clemency of character prompted Mary to care for her husband to the best of her ability. Even if she had not been moved to this by feeling, her reason would have informed her that power and position depended upon the breathing and the heartbeats of this poor, sick body, to safeguard which would be to defend her own happiness. But for real happiness, during her brief span of queenship in France, there was no scope. The storms aroused by the Huguenot movement were causing widespread agitation. After the conspiracy of Amboise, in which the royal pair were personally endangered, Mary had to pay one of the painful tributes called for by her position as ruler. She had to witness the execution of the rebels, and we may well suppose that the sight was deeply graven in her memory, forgotten then, maybe, for decades, to leap back again into vivid reality when the hour of her own doom struck. Now she watched the awesome sight of a human being, hands tied behind the back, kneeling with head on the block and awaiting the fall of the executioner’s axe. She heard for the first time the curiously muffled and dull tone of steel that severs living flesh, she saw the blood squirt, and the head rolling away from the body into the sand. A picture gruesome enough to blot out from the remembrance of a sensitive soul the splendid scenes so recently enacted at Rheims when her young head was crowned.
         </p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394710-00003">Now evil tidings followed quickly one upon the other. Mary’s mother, Mary of Guise, who had been acting as regent in Scotland during her daughter’s minority, had reached her end and, surrounded by enemies, breathed her last in June 1560. She left the country embroiled in religious strife and in full rebellion, with war raging along the border and English armies occupying the Lowlands. Mary Stuart had to exchange her festal attire for mourning. For the time being she was to hear no more music; her feet were for a while no longer to tread the mazes of the dance. Then Death’s bony knuckle came knocking at the door of her hearth and home. Francis II grew weaker and weaker; the envenomed blood usually flowing so sluggishly through his veins now beat a tattoo in his temples and his ears. No more could he even walk or ride, but had to be carried in a litter from place to place. At length the gathering pus burst the eardrum; but it was too late, for the inflammation had already spread inwards to the brain, and the sufferer was beyond reach of medical aid. His heart ceased to beat on 6th December 1560.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394710-00004">Once more a tragical scene between two women was played to the finish beside this second deathbed. Hardly was the breath out of Francis’ frail body when Mary Stuart, no longer Queen of France, had to yield precedence to Catherine de’ Medici; the younger of the royal widows had to draw back at the door in order to allow the elder one to go first. Mary was no longer the first lady in the realm, but again, as before, the second. One short year sufficed to bring Mary Stuart’s dream to an end. She would never again be reigning Queen of France, but must henceforth remain till the hour of her death what she had always been from birth: Mary Queen of Scotland and the Isles.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394710-00005">The rigours of regal etiquette in France decreed that a king’s widow should pass forty days in strict seclusion during which she might not for a moment leave her private apartments, or admit the daylight into her rooms. In the first two weeks of mourning she was forbidden to receive any visitors except the new King and his next of kin, and these she entertained in her retreat which, gloomy as it was and lit only by candles, resembled a living tomb. Nor might a royal widow wear the regulation black adopted almost universally by commoners as a sign of bereavement. The widow of a French monarch had to don the “<i>deuil blanc</i>”<i>—</i>white mourning<i>—</i>prescribed by the law of the land. A white coif framed the pale face, a white brocade dress covered body and limbs, the shoes and stockings were white. Ample folds of white fell from head to waist. This is how Janet depicts Mary Stuart in the days of her mourning; this is how Ronsard portrays her in words:

         <p class="fp" id="rw-p_394710-00006">(A long veil, soft and clinging, fold upon fold, a mourning garb, swathes your body from head to waist. It bellies and fills like a sail before the wind, urging the barque along. Thus were you clad when, alas, you left the beautiful land whose sceptre you had held in your hand, when, pensive and weeping as you were, tears, like crystals, coursed down your cheeks while you paced the long alleyways in the gardens of that royal castle whose name derives from the beauty of its waters.) Never before had this young and sympathetic and gentle creature been more successfully painted than at this time of her first grief and her first disappointment. Her roving and restless eyes had become steadfast and earnest in expression; the dignity of her bearing is more obvious in the modest and simple garb of mourning than in the portraits which show her bedecked with gems and the insignia of power.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394710-00007">The same dignified melancholy speaks to us from the lines she herself composed as a lament for her dead husband. These verses are not unworthy of the young Queen’s master, Ronsard. Even if it had not been penned by a queen, the tender elegy would appeal to any heart through the simplicity of its tone and its touching candour. Here we find no passionate regret for the young dead King, since Mary Stuart was always truthful and candid where poetry was concerned, though not invariably so in the world of politics. But we are given a picture of her utter loneliness, and the feeling that she was lost and forsaken.</p>

         <p class="fp" id="rw-p_394710-00008">(Unceasingly my heart bemoans the absence of my dear. If to the distant skies I lift my mournful gaze, I see his gentle eyes gaze down from the misty heights; and the waters all around seem to me like a grave. When, resting on my couch, I close my eyes and drowse, his hand softly strokes me. In labour and repose his presence never quits my side.) Mary Stuart’s sorrow at the loss of her husband, Francis II, was undeniably genuine, and not merely a poetical fiction. For in losing Francis, Mary not only lost a pleasant and docile companion and an affectionate friend, but at the same time her position among European potentates, her power and her security. This woman, who was still half a child, soon felt how much it signified to her stability and gratification to be the first lady in a great kingdom, and how paltry it was to have to be content with playing second fiddle. Indeed, for proud natures, this is even more galling than to be nobody at all. Mary’s situation was rendered if anything bitterer by Catherine de’ Medici’s open hostility now that that haughtiest member of a haughty house had resumed her old place at Court. It would appear that Mary, in an unwitting moment, goaded by the inconsiderate rashness of youth, had incurred the elder lady’s undying displeasure by hazarding an observation on the commercial origins of the wealthy family of Medici, and referring to the upstart ancestors of this merchant’s daughter, thus making a derogatory comparison with her own long line of kingly forefathers. Such scatterbrained utterances—heedless and ill-advised, she was at a future date to let her tongue run away with her in regard to Elizabeth of England as well—when spoken by one woman to the detriment of another, are more devastating in their consequences than open invectives. Catherine’s ambitions had already been thwarted during two long decades through the power wielded by Diane de Poitiers; then came Mary Stuart’s rise. Hardly, therefore, had she at length entered into her own and taken her place in the political arena when she allowed her detestation of these two rivals to find challenging and dictatorial vent.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394710-00009">But in Mary Stuart’s case, pride, which was an essential trait in her make-up, prevented her from accepting a minor part. High-hearted and passionate by nature, she refused half-glories and petty positions. Better to be accounted nothing, better to be dead, than to be an underling. For a space she thought seriously of retiring to a nunnery, of eschewing worldly prerogatives, of forfeiting her rights and privileges, since she could not be the leading lady of her court. But life was still too seductive a business for a girl of eighteen to go against the dictates of her innermost being and give up its allurements for ever. Besides, it was possible that the lost crown might yet be compensated for by the acquisition of another, and no less resplendent, one. The Spanish ambassador was even now suing for Mary on behalf of Don Carlos, the heir to two worlds; the court of Austria was simultaneously undertaking secret negotiations; the Kings of Sweden and of Denmark were offering her throne and hand. And was she not, as ever, a queen in her own right; was she not Queen of Scotland and the Isles? Then there was the neighbour crown of England which might fall to her at any moment. Incalculable possibilities lay around the girl-widow now ripening to the full beauty of womanhood—though henceforward she would have to grab what she could get. Gone for ever the days when treasures dropped into her lap like gifts from the gods. Henceforward she would have to fight a lone hand, would have to seize what she wanted by the manipulation of the arts of diplomacy, using her utmost skill, exercising patience. But with such an abundance of courage, with so much loveliness at her command, with youth to warm her blossoming body, why should she not venture on the boldest game? Resolute and greatly daring, Mary Stuart marched forth to battle.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394710-00010">Granted, it would be hard to bid farewell to France. She had lived twelve years at this royal court, in this beautiful, wealthy, happy land that seemed more like home to her than Scotland, which had by now become no more than a vague memory of childhood. Here, in France, dwelt her mother’s relatives, who cherished and guarded her; here were the many palaces and castles wherein she had passed any number of cheerful hours; here lived the poets who had sung her praises and who had so well understood her; here she was surrounded by the knightly courtesies which rendered life so charming, the gallant chivalry which suited her taste so admirably. She put off her departure from month to month, hesitant in spite of urgent messages from her homeland. She visited her relatives in Joinville and in Nancy, was present at the coronation of her ten-year-old brother-in-law, Charles IX, in Rheims cathedral. Perpetually she found fresh excuses for postponing the journey, as though she harboured a premonition of its finality. It was as if she were waiting for some sign that would spare her the dreaded separation from France and the voyage home.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394710-00011">For no matter how inexperienced a girl of eighteen may be in affairs of state, it is undeniable that Mary Stuart must have been convinced that a very hard test was awaiting her so soon as she set foot on her native soil. Since her mother’s death, the Protestant Lords of the Congregation, her fiercest enemies, had gained the upper hand, and they were at no pains to hide the fact that they did not want a Catholic, a believer in the Mass and other idolatrous practices, to return to the land. They brazenly declared (and the English ambassador eagerly conveyed the news to London) that the Queen’s journey to Scotland must be postponed for a few months longer, and, were it not that it was their duty to obey, they would not be much put out if they never saw her again. They had, as a matter of fact, been intriguing on the quiet, proposing that the Queen of England should marry the Protestant James Hamilton, Earl of Arran, who was the next heir to the Scottish throne, thus bartering the crown to Mary’s rival, a crown that was unquestionably Mary Stuart’s by right of succession. Nor could she place any greater confidence in her own half-brother James Stuart, who, as envoy from the Scottish parliament, sought Mary out in France “to know her mind”. His relations with Elizabeth were dubious, and some even suspected that he was in the English Queen’s pay. The only way for Mary to put an end to these intrigues was to be on the spot herself, and with proverbial Stuart courage defend and maintain her rights to the Stuart throne. Determined not to lose a second crown within a year of losing the other, full of dreary foreboding and heavy at heart, Mary Stuart obeyed a summons which had not proceeded from loyal hearts and which she obeyed while half doubtful as to its honesty.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394710-00012">Before returning to her native land, Mary Stuart could not but be aware that Elizabeth had no reason and still less any inclination to make things easy and smooth for a rival who was only awaiting her death to step into her shoes and mount the English throne. With cynical candour, Elizabeth’s minister, Cecil, supported every aggressive act on the part of his sovereign, saying: “The longer the Scottish Queen’s affairs remain in disorder, the better for Your Majesty’s cause.” The animus aroused by that painted claim to the throne of England was still fresh and vigorous. True, the Scottish estates and lords in Edinburgh had drawn up a treaty with England wherein it was clearly stated that Mary Stuart “for all times coming” undertook to recognise Elizabeth as the rightful tenant of the English throne. But when the document reached Paris and was placed before Mary for signature, she and young Francis refused to ratify it or to have anything to do with it. Renunciation was not in Mary’s blood, especially since her claim had officially been incorporated in her husband’s coat of arms. Never would she be able to lower the standard once it had been raised. For political reasons she might consent to not making a display of her pretensions, but in the innermost sanctum of her heart Mary Stuart had an iron determination never to yield in this matter.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394710-00013">Elizabeth could not tolerate such ambiguity; for her the question must be settled with an outright Yes or No. Acting on behalf of Mary, the Scottish Queen’s representatives in Edinburgh, said Elizabeth, had already signed the treaty, thus committing their sovereign to the undertaking, and compelling her to acquiesce. The English monarch would not be satisfied with a secret agreement; what she needed was a public and binding pronouncement, a document which should leave no door open for misinterpretation. Every refusal on Mary’s part suggested that she still laid claim to Elizabeth’s possessions; that, in addition to the Scottish throne, she felt herself entitled to ascend the English. Elizabeth, whose sympathies lay more in the direction of the Protestant cause, knew only too well that half her realm was still passionately Catholic in sentiment. A Catholic pretender to her throne meant, therefore, not merely a danger to her public office, but likewise a menace to her private life. For safety’s sake she must have Mary’s signature to the before-mentioned treaty, and it was sound policy on her part that she should not relax in open hostility to the Scottish Queen so long as the latter refused to sign. She felt her position insecure, felt that she was no true queen, until her rival had made public acknowledgment and had abdicated all immediate claims to the English crown.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394710-00014">None would venture to deny that right was on Elizabeth’s side in the quarrel. Unfortunately she put herself in the wrong by trying to settle a political conflict of such magnitude by adopting petty and unworthy methods. When women enter the field of politics, they are often tempted to wound opponents with pinpricks and to envenom rivalries by the use of personal invective. In this instance Elizabeth, despite the width of her political vision, fell into the fault peculiar to her sex when faced by such circumstances. Mary was proposing to travel home by sea, but asked for a “safe conduct” should sickness or rough weather make a landing on English soil desirable. Was not this demand a fairly plain proffer of a desire for a friendly personal talk with her cousin—a talk which might smooth away their differences? To grant the safe conduct would have been no more than a formal act of courtesy, since anyhow the sea route was open. Elizabeth’s response was to say that she would grant no safe conduct so long as Mary had not placed her signature at the foot of the Edinburgh treaty. In the hope of coercing the Queen she thus wounded the woman. Instead of making a magnanimous gesture or if necessary going to war, she had recourse to a personal affront.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394710-00015">So far the conflict between the two cousins had been more or less masked; now all veils were wrenched aside, and with hard, hot eyes one proud woman confronted the other. Mary Stuart summoned the English ambassador to audience, and addressed him with passionate disdain:</p>

I may pass well enough home into my own realm, I think, without her passport or licence, for though the late King your master used all the impeachment he could both to stay me, and to catch me when I came hither, yet you know, Monsieur l’Ambassadeur, I came hither safely—and I may have as good means to help me home again as I had to come hither, if I would employ my friends … You have, Monsieur l’Ambassadeur, oftentimes told me that the amity between the Queen your mistress and me was very necessary and profitable for us both. I have some reason now to think that the Queen your mistress is not of that mind; for I am sure, if she were, she would not have refused me thus unkindly. It seemeth she maketh more account of the amity of my disobedient </i><i>subjects than she doth of me their sovereign, who am her equal in degree, though inferior in wisdom and experience, her nighest kinswoman, and her next neighbour … I ask nothing but her friendship; I do not trouble her state, nor practise with her subjects—and yet I know there be in her realm those that be inclined enough to hear offers.</i>

         <p class="fp" id="rw-p_394710-00017">This was a threat in good earnest, strong rather than wise, for before ever setting foot in Scotland Mary Stuart already allowed it to be known that, if constrained to fight Elizabeth, she would carry the war over the border and onto English soil. In courtly words the ambassador drew Mary’s attention to the fact that these many difficulties and misunderstandings had arisen because she bore the arms of England diversely quartered with her own and used notoriously the style and tide of the Queen his mistress. To which Mary answered in spirited protest:</p> 
         <div class="block extract" id="rw-block-extract_394710-00004">
            <p id="rw-p_394710-00018"><i>Monsieur l’Ambassadeur, I was then under the command of King Henry my father, and of the King my lord and husband; and whatsoever was done then by their order and commandments, the same was in like manner continued until both their deaths; since which time, you know I have neither borne the arms, nor used the title of England. Methinks these my doings might ascertain the Queen your mistress that that which was done before, was done by commandment of them that had the power over me; and also in reason she ought to be satisfied, seeing I order my doings as I tell you. It were no great dishonour to the Queen my cousin … though I, as Queen also, did bear the Arms of England; for I am sure some inferior to me, and that be not on every side so well apparented as I am, do bear the Arms of England. You cannot deny but that my grandmother was the King her father’s sister, and, I trow, the eldest sister he had …</i>

         <p class="fp" id="rw-p_394710-00019">Though the method of expression was quite friendly, beneath the outer semblance of amiability the ambassador detected another threat. When, wishing to smooth matters over, he urged Mary to clear unpleasantness out of the way by fulfilling her representatives’ pledge and signing the Edinburgh protocol, Mary was evasive, as always when this thorny point came up for discussion. She did not actually decline to sign the treaty, but promised to consult her estates after her arrival in Scotland. The English ambassador, however, paid her back in her own coin, and remained as evasive as she, refusing to commit himself or his mistress in the matter of the succession. Whenever negotiations took a critical turn, and it became evident that one queen or the other would have to cede a particle of her rights, both women became insincere. Each hung on to her trump card, grimly and resolutely. Thus the game was protracted indefinitely, and must inevitably lead to a tragical issue. Of a sudden Mary broke off the discussion concerning her safe conduct; it was as if a cloth had been torn across, producing a harsh and rasping hiss.</p> 
         <div class="block extract" id="rw-block-extract_394710-00005">
            <p id="rw-p_394710-00020"><i>If my preparations were not so much advanced as they are, peradventure the Queen your mistress’ unkindness might stay my voyage; but now I am determined to adventure the matter, whatsoever come of it; I trust the wind will be so favourable that I shall not need to come on the coast of England; for if I do then, Monsieur l’Ambassadeur, the Queen your mistress shall have me in her hands to do her will of me; and if she be so hardhearted as to desire my end, she may then do her pleasure and make sacrifice of me. Peradventure that casualty might be better for me than to live. In this matter, God’s will be fulfilled.</i>

         </div> 
         <p class="fp" id="rw-p_394710-00021">For the first time in her life Mary Stuart put force, self-determination, and resoluteness into the words she spoke. As a rule she had proved herself to be of an affable, easy-going, frivolous and laughter-loving nature, more enthralled with enjoyment and the beauty of life than with a fight; but now she showed herself to be hard as iron, defiant, daring, for she was faced by an issue involving her personal pride, while her rights as Queen were likewise being questioned. Better by far to die than bend to another’s will. Better royal folly than pitiful weakness. One who challenged her queenly dignity touched the very nerve of her life. In moments like this she became truly great and, woman though she was, she showed a man’s knightly strength. The ambassador sent an express to London, reporting that his mission had not met with success. Elizabeth thereupon, with her usual suppleness and shrewdness where politics were concerned, yielded the point, and dispatched a passport to Calais forthwith. It arrived two days behind time, for Mary had meanwhile decided to undertake the voyage even though this might mean an encounter with English privateers in the Channel. She infinitely preferred running a risk and experiencing grave discomfort to accepting a favour at the price of humiliation. Elizabeth had missed a splendid opportunity. Had she, on this occasion, acted with magnanimity, had she welcomed as an honoured guest the young woman whom she had reason to fear as a rival, she might have swept the whole of this dangerous conflict out of her path. Alas that reason and politics so seldom can step hand in hand along the same road! May it not be that the dramatic events in the history of mankind arise solely from a failure to seize possibilities?</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394710-00022">The sun in its setting often illuminates the countryside with a red and golden glory, giving to the landscape a false aspect of life and vitality. Such a deceptive aureole surrounded Mary Stuart as she took her final leave of France, for the French made a point of carrying out in her honour a full ceremonial in all its magnificent ostentation. She, who had been a French king’s bride, who had fallen from her high estate through no fault of her own, and who had been deprived of her position as France’s ruler by a mishap, could not be allowed to leave the land of her adoption unaccompanied and unsung. It must be made abundantly clear to everyone that Mary was not sailing forth under a cloud, as the unhappy widow of a French monarch or as a weak and helpless woman whom her friends had left in the lurch. No, the Queen of Scotland was going home, backed by French honour and French arms. Setting out from Saint-Germain, she made her way to Calais in the company of a vast procession, a cavalcade whose horses were caparisoned with the most elaborate and beautiful harness, trappings inlaid with gold and other precious metals, and whose riders were dressed in the full splendour of which the French Renaissance was capable. The highway leading to the little port was made gay with colour, bright with the polished steel of weapons, loud with the voices of the flower of the French nobility. At the head of the brilliant retinue was a state carriage conveying the Queen’s uncles, the Duke of Guise and the Cardinals of Lorraine and Guise. Mary herself was surrounded by the four girls who had never left her, by noblewomen, pages, poets and musicians. The days of romance and chivalry seemed to be living a second springtime. The train was followed by a succession of chariots bearing costly furniture and other objects that had gone to the making of her homes in France. The crown jewels were transported in a closed shrine. As she had come a queen, welcomed with a pageantry and honour worthy of her rank, so too did she leave the country of her adoption, the country which had won the love of her heart. But on this occasion joy was lacking, that innocent joy which had lit up the eyes of an astonished child; this was the fading afterglow of sunset and not the radiance of dawn.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394710-00023">The main body of the princely cortège stayed ashore in Calais. Then the cavalcade dispersed, each rider seeking his own home. Away in Paris, sheltered behind the walls of the Louvre, another monarch was awaiting the return of these nobles who were henceforth to serve him, for courtiers may not live in the pomp of yesterday, it being their business to think only of the present and the future. Dignities and position, not the human being who has to shoulder them, are the only things that count so far as a courtier is concerned. These fine fellows will forget Mary Stuart as soon as the wind has filled the sails of her galleon; they will expunge her image from their hearts. The parting was no more to them than a pathetic ritual, belonging to the same category of public pageantry as a coronation or a funeral. Genuine sorrow at Mary Stuart’s melancholy pilgrimage was felt only by the poets, for poets are endowed with keener perceptions and with the twofold gifts of prophecy and remembrance. Those who wept over Mary’s going knew only too acutely that with this young woman, who had wished to create a court of cheerfulness and beauty, the Muses would disappear likewise from French territory; they foresaw days filled with vicissitude and uncertainty for themselves and the French people; they sensed the advent of political and religious disputes and contentions, the struggle with the Huguenots, the disastrous St Bartholomew’s night, squabbles with zealots and quibblers. Gone were the days of chivalry, gone romance, as the maidenly figure disappeared over the waters. The star of poesy, the star of the “Pléiade”, was about to set in a murky sky rendered the gloomier by the prospect of war. Spiritual happiness, pure and unsullied, sailed away with Mary Stuart. As Ronsard put it, in his elegy <i>Au Départ</i>:

In this same poem the writer, with a heart ever responsive to all that was young and charming, wished to celebrate in the written word that which his ardent eyes would never again behold in the quick, warm flesh.

Beauty lives no longer than a day, roses and lilies die when spring is dead. Thus has your flowerlike loveliness passed away after gracing our France for fifteen years, passed with the speed of a lightning flash, leaving behind it nothing but regret, and a grief which continually calls to mind the memory of so radiant a princess.) Whereas by the court and nobles and gentry of France the absent Queen was soon to be forgotten, the poets of that fair realm were to remain for long her faithful servitors; for to the poetic imagination misfortune invests the sufferer with fresh nobility, and she whom the poets had sung on account of her beauty would henceforward be doubly loved because of the evils which befell her. To the end of her days Mary Stuart kept their faithful homage, and their tuneful lyrics accompanied her even as she mounted the scaffold. When a person of intrinsic worth lives a life that is a genuine poem, a true drama, a beautiful saga and ballad, poets will never be lacking to clothe it anew and to breathe into it the fresh and vibrant imagery of inspiration.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394710-00026">A splendid white galleon was riding at anchor in Calais roads. She was a French flagship, flying the Scottish colours as well. Here, on 14th August 1561, Mary Stuart went aboard, accompanied by three of her uncles, a few of the most distinguished noblemen and the four Marys, her inseparable companions. Two other vessels formed an escort. But the ship had not left the inner harbour, her sails had not been fully unfurled, when a portent cast a shadow on this voyage into the unknown. A vessel entering the port the Queen had barely left struck the bar, foundered and sank. Mary, greatly agitated, called upon her captain to save the drowning mariners. But the accident had occurred too suddenly for human aid to be of any avail. This catastrophe was, indeed, a bad omen for the young and inexperienced woman who was leaving the protection of a land she loved to take up her duties as Queen and ruler in a country that was strange and foreign to her.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394710-00027">Was it a secret dread of what fate held in store for her, was it a keen sense of loss as she left what had hitherto been her homeland, was it a feeling that she would not return to these shores, which brought the tears to eyes whose gaze never for a moment left the retreating landscape, the country where she had spent her carefree girlhood, where she had been so happy because no worries had been allowed to approach her? Her passionate grief on bidding farewell to France has been touchingly described for us by Brantôme:</p> 
         <div class="block extract" id="rw-block-extract_394710-00008">
            <p id="rw-p_394710-00028"><i>So soon as the ship had steered clear of the harbour and the wind rose a little, the crew began to hoist the sails. Standing in the stern, close to the rudder, and leaning with both arms on the taffrail, Queen Mary wept as she looked at the harbour and the country from which she was departing. There she remained, again and again mournfully repeating: “Farewell, France,” until night fell. Her companions urged her to retire to her cabin and rest, but she refused, so a couch was improvised for her on the poop. Before lying down she told the pilot to awaken her at dawn if the coast of France were still visible. He was not to be afraid, even if he had to shout at her. Fortune favoured her wishes. Since the wind had dropped, it was necessary to have recourse to the oars, and the galleon made little progress. At daybreak France was still in the offing. Directly the pilot spoke to her, she rose and continued to gaze at the coasts so long as they were in sight, again and again repeating plaintively: “Farewell, France! Farewell, France! I fear I shall never see you more.”</i>
