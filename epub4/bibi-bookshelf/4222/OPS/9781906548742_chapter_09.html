         <p class="fp" id="rw-fp_394716-00001"><span class="dropcap">D</span><span class="sc">ANGER WAS BENEFICIAL TO</span> Mary Stuart. Only in decisive moments, when she had to stake everything upon a last hazard, did it become plain that remarkable capacities were hidden away within her: iron resolution, all-embracing insight, fierce and heroic courage. But before the innermost energies could come into action, she needed a hard knock on one of her most sensitive points. Not until then did these otherwise dispersed forces become concentrated. One who tried to humiliate her produced so vigorous a reaction that every severe testing by destiny was advantageous to her.
         </p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394716-00001">During this night of her first great humiliation, her character became transformed once and for all. In the fiery forge of a most terrible experience, when she saw that her unduly ready confidence in her husband, her brother, her friends and her subjects had been misplaced, this otherwise extremely feminine and soft-hearted woman grew as hard as steel, acquiring the resilience and tenacity of metal that has been properly treated in the fire. But, being double-edged like a rapier, her character became ambiguous after that dreadful night, which was the beginning of her disasters. The curtain had risen on the bloody tragedy of her life.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394716-00002">Thoughts of vengeance filled her mind, now she was locked up in her own room, the prisoner of traitorous subjects, as she restlessly paced to and fro, pondering one way and another of breaking the circle of foes who environed her, meditating how she could make them atone for shedding the blood of her faithful servant (the blood which still stood in pools upon the floor)—how she could make them abase themselves before her, or bring them to the block, those who had so impudently forced themselves into her presence and had even laid hands upon her, their anointed sovereign. To her, who had hitherto always been a chivalrous fighter, any means now seemed justifiable in view of the outrage she had suffered. As part of the change which occurred in her, she, who had hitherto been impetuous and incautious, became cautious and reserved; she, who had been too honourable to tell falsehoods, learnt how to dissemble; she, whose theory and practice of life had been “fair play”, was now prepared to devote her exceptional capacities to the catching of traitors in their own snares.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394716-00003">There are occasions when more can be learnt in a day than, at ordinary times, in months or years. Such a decisive lesson had now been taught to Mary Stuart, and would influence her for the rest of her life. The conspirators who, almost under her very eyes, had thrust their daggers into her trusty Rizzio had also stabbed deep into the confidingness and nonchalance of her nature. Henceforward she would not make the mistake of being ready to believe traitors, of being truthful to liars, of frankly disclosing her heart to the heartless! No, henceforward she would be crafty, would wear a mask over her feelings, would conceal her hatred, would seem friendly to her enemies, always awaiting with hidden hatred the hour when she could avenge her favourite’s murder! She would devote her powers to the concealment of her true thoughts, would cajole her adversaries while they remained drunken with the triumph of their success, would, for a day or two, seem humble in the presence of miscreants, that thereafter she might humiliate them for ever! Such infamous treason could be avenged only by one who was herself ready to play the traitor more dauntlessly and more cynically than the traitors themselves.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394716-00004">Mary Stuart formed her plans with one of those lightning flashes of genius which, when the danger of death threatens, will often come even to persons of a dull and indifferent temperament. Her situation, as she instantly perceived, was hopeless so long as Darnley and the conspirators hung together. Only one thing could save her—to sow discord among her enemies. Since she could not break her chains by sudden violence, she must cunningly search for the weakest links; she must make one of the traitors betray the others. She knew well enough who was the weakling among these harsh men—had good reason to know. It was Darnley, the man with the “heart of wax” on which every finger could make a dint.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394716-00005">Mary’s first artifice was a psychological masterpiece. She declared that she had been seized by the pains of labour. Since she was in the fifth month of pregnancy, the excitement of the preceding night and the dragging away of her favourite to do him to death in a neighbouring room, were shocks that made a miscarriage likely enough. She feigned violent abdominal cramps, took to her bed and, in her supposed circumstances, it would have been incredible cruelty to forbid the access of her tire women and her doctor. That was all she wanted for the moment, since therewith her strict seclusion would be broken. Now she had the chance of communicating with Bothwell and Huntly, and of concerting with them means for her escape. Furthermore, by this assumed illness, she put the conspirators (her husband, above all) in a quandary. For the child in her womb was heir to the throne of Scotland and to the throne of England as well, and an overwhelming responsibility was thrust upon the father before the eyes of the world, since his action overnight had endangered the child’s life. Full of concern, Darnley appeared in his wife’s apartment.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394716-00006">Now began a dramatic scene, perhaps, in its crowning improbability, comparable only to that scene in Shakespeare when Richard III, before the coffin of a man he has murdered, woos and wins the dead man’s widow. At Holyrood, likewise, the murdered man was still unburied; there, likewise, the murderer or one of the confederates was confronted by a person whom he had heinously betrayed; there, likewise, the art of misrepresentation acquired demonic skill. There was no witness to the scene. We are acquainted only with its opening and its end. Darnley entered his wife’s room, the room of the woman on whom, the night before, he had inflicted so gross a humiliation—the woman who, in the first outburst of righteous wrath, had announced her determination to be revenged. Like Kriemhild beside Siegfried’s corpse, she had yesterday still clenched her fists against the assassin. But, also like Kriemhild, she had, for the sake of her vengeance, learnt during the night to conceal her hatred. Darnley found, not the Mary of yesterday evening, the fierce and proud spirit of vengeance personified, but an unhappy, a broken-hearted woman, weary unto death, yielding, ill; a woman who looked submissively and tenderly at the strong, the tyrannical man who had shown himself to be her master. The conceited fool was able to enjoy the triumph that he had dreamt of the day before. At length Mary was wooing him once more. Since she had felt the weight of his iron hand, she, hitherto so arrogant, had become mild and gentle. Now that he had got the Italian rascal out of the way, she was once more ready to serve her true lord and master.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394716-00007">To a man of outstanding intelligence, so rapid a change of front would have appeared suspicious. He would have recalled her outcry of the night before, when, with flashing eyes, she had screamed that he was a traitor and the son of a traitor. He would have borne in mind that, as a daughter of the House of Stuart, she would be most unlikely to forgive a humiliation or to forget an affront. But Darnley was, like most empty-headed persons, exceedingly vain. Like stupids in general, he was blinded by flattery. Then, as a further and remarkable complication, of all the men with whom she had come into contact, this hot-headed youth was the one whose senses had been most effectually roused by Mary Stuart. He craved for the possession of her body, was in this respect her thrall, and nothing had embittered him more than her refusal, of late to accept his embraces. Now, wonder of wonders, the coveted woman declared herself wholly his, asked him to spend the night with her, no longer held aloof. Instantly his forces were undermined; he became once more her affectionate lover, her slave, her servant. No one can tell by what subtle arts of deception Mary effected this conversion which was as wondrous as that of Saul on the road to Damascus. Actually, within twenty-four hours after the murder of Rizzio, Darnley, who had just before betrayed Mary to the Scottish lords, had become her bondsman, willing to fulfil her slightest wish, and prepared to do his utmost to cheat his confederates of yesterday. More easily even than they had won him away from her, did the wife recover the allegiance of her serf. He disclosed to her the names of the conspirators, was ready and willing to flee with Mary, and was weak enough to become her instrument of vengeance in a way which would, in the end, make him betray the traitors. It was as a pliable tool that he left the room he had entered in so masterful a spirit. A few hours after her deepest abasement, Mary thus succeeded in breaking the front of her enemies. Without the conspirators being aware of it, the chief figure among them had entered into a conspiracy against them. Crude betrayal had been vanquished by the treason of genius.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394716-00008">Half the work of liberation had already been achieved when Moray and the other outlawed nobles rode into Edinburgh. In conformity with his temperament as a calculating tactician, the man who had been the soul of the conspiracy had stayed away from its execution and had been careful to avoid participating in the deed of slaughter. Never would this man of tricks and wiles be found walking along a dangerous path. But, as ever, when others had borne the burden of the day, he turned up with clean hands, tranquil, proud, self-confident, to garner the fruits. On this eleventh day of April, in accordance with his half-sister’s original plans, he was to have been publicly declared a traitor by parliament. But, lo and behold, his imprisoned sister seemed, all in a moment, to have forgotten her hatred. Despair having made her an admirable actress, she flung herself into his arms, to give him the Judas kiss which yesterday she had received from her husband. Urgently but tenderly she begged the brotherly advice and help of the man whom so recently she had outlawed.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394716-00009">Moray, being a keen psychologist, understood the situation fairly well. Yet his sister outwitted him. There can be no doubt that, in planning and approving the assassination of Rizzio, his aim had been to frustrate Mary’s secret aim to restore Catholicism in Scotland. From his point of view, the swarthy Italian intriguer had been a grievous danger to the Protestant, to the Scottish cause, and furthermore a serious obstacle in the way of Moray’s own will-to-power. Now that Rizzio was dead bones, Moray would have liked the whole unsavoury affair to be speedily forgotten, and he therefore proposed a compromise. The degrading watch kept over the Queen by the rebellious lords was to come to an end immediately, and Mary’s supreme authority was to be re-established. On her side, she was to let bygones be bygones, and to pardon the patriotic homicides.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394716-00010">It need hardly be said that Mary, who meanwhile had planned every detail of her flight with her treacherous spouse, had no intention of forgiving the murderers. Since, however, her supreme object was to lull the rebels’ watchfulness to sleep, she declared herself in full agreement with the aforesaid terms. So admirably had she, during that one night of terror, learnt the art of deception that her brother, who had known her from earliest childhood, cheerfully believed in her good intentions. Forty-eight hours after Rizzio’s assassination, with the burial of his mutilated corpse the incident seemed to have been shovelled away underground. Affairs must go on as if nothing had happened. A strolling musician, a man of no account, had been put out of the way, and that was all that had happened. A strolling musician! The conceited and beggarly fellow would soon be forgotten, and peace would reign once more over Scotland.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394716-00011">The pact was signed. But, strangely enough, the conspirators did not fulfil their side of the bargain and withdraw their sentries from the gates of Holyrood. For one reason or another, they were uneasy. They were too well acquainted with Stuart pride to believe that Mary would forgive and look upon the levelling of a pistol against herself, and the murder of her favourite, as mere trifles. They thought it would be safer for them to keep the unruly woman under watch and ward, and to deprive her of any possibility of taking vengeance. She would be dangerous, they felt, so long as she was left at liberty. Another circumstance that disquieted them was that Darnley was once more on excellent terms with his wife, went often to her apartment, and there held long and private conversations with her. Their own experience had taught them how little pressure was needed to influence this weakling, and they began openly to express their suspicion that Mary was trying to detach him from their cause to her own. They expressly warned Darnley not to trust any of her promises and to keep faith with them, for otherwise, as they said (a true prophecy), “both you and we will have cause to repent.” Although, of course, the liar pledged himself to be faithful to them, they thought it would be better to keep their sentries posted round the Queen’s rooms until she had given them a written promise of impunity. Just as these strange friends of legality had wanted a charter before committing their crime, so now they wanted a charter of absolution.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394716-00012">We see that these tried and trained perjurers knew the emptiness and valuelessness of the spoken word, and would therefore only be satisfied with documentary pledges. Mary, however, was at once too proud and too cautious to bind herself to assassins with a signature. Not one of the rascals should boast of holding her “bond” in his hand. But precisely because she was determined not to give the conspirators their charter of immunity, she pretended to be perfectly willing to comply with their demand. All she wanted was to gain time until the evening! To Darnley, now thoroughly tamed, she gave the shameful commission (seven times unworthy of a king) of holding his yesterday’s comrades in check by fictitious cordiality and of humbugging them about the signature. She sent him as her negotiator to the rebels, and in conjunction with them he drafted a formal charter of impunity to which, then, nothing was lacking but Mary Stuart’s signature. Well, it was now too late in the evening to get that. The Queen was very tired and had gone to sleep. He promised, however, since one lie more did not matter, to bring back the document to them next morning early, signed and sealed. When a king has given his word, doubt would be a grievous affront. The conspirators, therefore, to fulfil their side of the bargain, withdrew the sentries posted outside the Queen’s bedchamber. That was what she wanted. The path to flight was open.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394716-00013">Hardly had her doors been freed from the watchers, when Mary rose hastily from what she had pretended to be her sickbed and energetically began her preparations. Bothwell and her other friends outside the palace had long since been notified. At midnight saddled horses were waiting in the shadow of the churchyard wall. All that was necessary was to lull the watchfulness of the conspirators, and once more there was assigned to the man whom Mary most despised and whom she now made use of for the last time—to Darnley—the shameful role of numbing their senses with wine and jollity. Such contemptible business was all he was fit for in her estimation. Obedient as a marionette, he asked those who so recently had been his confederates to a mighty carouse. Wine flowed freely, and the boon companions drank to the coming reconciliation. When, at length, with swimming heads and unsteady feet, the members of the company betook themselves to bed, Darnley, wishing to avoid giving rise to suspicion, carefully refrained from betaking himself to the Queen’s room. But his cronies were no longer troubled about such a trifle. The Queen had promised to pardon them, the King had guaranteed their impunity. Rizzio had been buried, and Moray was back in Edinburgh. What further need was there to think or to spy? They retired to their couches and slept soundly after so arduous a day of drunkenness and triumph.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394716-00014">At midnight, when silence had long prevailed in the passages of the sleeping palace, a gate was gently opened. Through the servants’ quarters and down the stairs Mary groped her way into the cellarage; then, by a subterranean passage, she went to the churchyard—a gloomy route which led through burial vaults lit by flickering torches, which fitfully revealed coffins and the bones of the dead in the crypts of the damp and chilly walls. Upstairs, now, to reach, at length, the open air! She had only to cross the churchyard and join her friends, waiting outside with horses. Of a sudden Darnley stumbled over a new-made grave; the Queen joined him, and recognised with horror that it was the place of David Rizzio’s interment, a little mound over his new-made corpse.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394716-00015">This was a last proof of the hammer of destiny, to harden yet further the injured woman’s already hardened heart. She knew what tasks awaited her—to reinstate her royal honour by this flight, and to bring an heir to the throne safely into the world, then to take vengeance upon all who had combined to humiliate her. Vengeance on him, too, who now had become her helper! Without hesitating a moment, the wife, who was well advanced in pregnancy, flung herself astride on horseback behind Arthur Erskine, the faithful captain of the bodyguard. She felt safer with her arms round him than she would have if she had been clasping her husband who indeed, without waiting for her, wishing to make sure of his own skin, had already galloped off. Thus clinging to Erskine, the Queen made all possible speed for twenty-one miles to Seton House, where Lord Seton was awaiting her with an escort of two hundred riders. Now, mounted on her own horse and with her attendant train, by daylight the fugitive had once more become the sovereign. Before noon she reached Dunbar. Here, instead of seeking repose, she instantly set to work. It was not enough to call herself Queen, for at such times she must fight for the reality of queenship. She wrote dispatches to be sent in every direction, summoning her loyal nobles to form an army against the rebels, who held Holyrood. Her life was saved; now she had to save her crown and her honour. Always this woman, when she became inspired with a thirst for vengeance, or when any of her other passions were strongly aroused, knew how to conquer weakness, to get the better of fatigue. It was in these great and decisive moments that she became equal to her task.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394716-00016">A great shock to the conspirators to discover at Holyrood on the morrow that the royal apartments were empty; that the Queen had fled; that Darnley, their confederate and protector, had also disappeared! In the first moments, however, they did not realise the full extent of the disaster. Relying upon Darnley’s royal word, they continued to believe in the general amnesty that, in conjunction with him, they had drafted overnight. This, they thought, would hold good, and they could hardly believe that such treachery as his was possible. They refused to accept the notion that they had been humbugged. As envoy, they sent Lord Sempill to Dunbar, with a humble supplication to Her Majesty to sign their securities and perform the other articles, according to her promise. For three days, however, the envoy was kept waiting outside the gates, as Emperor Henry IV was kept waiting by Gregory in the snow at Canossa. She would not treat with rebels—all the less now that Bothwell had assembled his troops. The conspirators became greatly alarmed, and their ranks began to thin. One after another they made their way to Dunbar to sue for pardon, but the ringleaders, such as Ruthven, who had been the first to attack Rizzio, and Andrew Ker of Faudonside, who had threatened the Queen with a pistol, knew that for them there could be no pardon. With speed they fled from the country, and even John Knox, who had been too swift and too loud in his approval of the murder, thought it expedient to disappear for a time.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394716-00017">Moved by her desire for revenge, Mary would now have liked to make a signal example of these rebellious nobles, and to show them and the world that no one could conspire against her with impunity. But the situation was already dangerous enough to teach them caution for the future. Moray, though he had certainly been privy to the conspiracy (as was shown by his prompt arrival in Edinburgh after Rizzio’s murder), had taken no active part in the affair. Mary perceived that she would be more prudent not to proceed to extremities against this half-brother of hers, who was a man of wide influence. “Not venturing to have so many at once at her hand,” as she herself said, “she thought better to close her eyes against some of the offenders.” Besides, if she proposed to take extreme measures, was not Darnley, her own husband, the first to be dealt with, since he had led the assassins into her bedroom and had held her hands while the murder was going on? But since her reputation had previously been injured by the Chastelard scandal, it suited Mary’s book better not to show forth Darnley in the light of the suspicious and jealous avenger of his honour. “Throw plenty of mud, for some of it will stick.” It would suit both Mary and Darnley better if the tale of recent events were bruited abroad in such a fashion as to show that Darnley, although he had been one of the prime instigators of the disastrous affair, had had neither part nor lot in the murder. This was hard to prove in the case of a man who had signed two bonds guaranteeing in advance impunity to the assassins, and whose own dirk, which he had lent to one of them, had been found sticking in Rizzio’s body. Puppets, however, have neither will nor honour, so Darnley danced obediently when Mary pulled the strings. Ceremoniously, staking his “honour” and his “word as a prince”, he had the most impudent falsehood of the century announced in Edinburgh marketplace, declaring he had had nothing to do with the late “treasonable conspiracy”; that it was calumny to accuse him of anything of the kind; that he had neither “counselled, commanded, consented or assisted”—though everyone in the capital and throughout the country knew that he had not only done all these things, but had “approved” the murder with seal and charter. If it was possible for a man to act more contemptibly than Darnley during the assassination of his sometime friend, he did so now by having this perjury publicly proclaimed. On all those upon whom she had sworn to be avenged, perhaps Mary Stuart took no more terrible vengeance than that which she took on Darnley when she forced the man, who had long since made himself contemptible, to intensify his disgrace by this outrageous lie.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394716-00018">A white pall of falsehood had now been spread over the murder. The strangely reconciled royal pair made a triumphant entry into Edinburgh. All seemed quiet there. To maintain the semblance of justice without stirring deep waters, a few poor devils were hanged, underlings, clansmen and private soldiers who, at the command of their lords, had guarded the doors while these were engaged in the cruel work upstairs; but those of blue blood went unpunished. Rizzio’s remains were sumptuously interred in the royal cemetery—as if this could have been any consolation to the dead man! His brother Joseph succeeded David as secretary. With these events, the tragical episode seemed to have been forgotten and forgiven. But the dead are not silent; their blood crieth from the ground against those who have consigned them to it. Persons who have been violently put to rest leave the guilty neither rest nor quiet.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394716-00019">After the dangers and excitement she had traversed, there was one thing essential to Mary if she was to consolidate a position which had been gravely shaken—she must successfully give birth to a healthy heir to the throne. Only as mother of a prospective king would she be safe, with a safety impossible to her as merely the wife of such a king as Darnley, a king of shreds and patches. Uneasily she awaited the difficult hours that lay before her. Gloom and depression overshadowed her during the last weeks before the birth. Was it that Rizzio’s death had left a scar in her mind? Was it that with her fortified energies she had an enhanced foreboding of imminent disaster? However that may be, she now made a will in which she bequeathed to Darnley a ring he had given her, “a diamond ring enamelled red”. Nor were Joseph Rizzio, Bothwell or the four Marys forgotten. For the first time in her life this woman, in general so carefree and bold, seemed to be dreading death or peril. Quitting Holyrood, which, as the tragical night of David Rizzio’s murder had shown, was not a safe place of residence, she removed to the less comfortable but impregnable Edinburgh Castle to await there the birth of the heir to the Scottish and English crowns.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394716-00020">On the morning of 19th June 1566, a royal salute from the guns of the fortress at length announced to the town the joyful news that a son had been born, a new Stuart King of Scotland. There would be an end to the dangerous “regiment of women”. The mother’s most ardent wish and the strong desire of the country for a male heir to the House of Stuart had been fulfilled. But hardly had the child been born, when Mary felt it incumbent upon her to safeguard his honour. No doubt rumour had brought to her news of the poisonous suspicion which the conspirators had instilled into Darnley’s ears, to the effect that she had had adulterous relations with Rizzio. She knew how glad would be her “dear sister” Elizabeth in London to find any pretext for contesting the paternity of her son, and perhaps subsequently, on that ground, refusing to him the right of succession to the English crown. She therefore determined forthwith and most publicly to nail this lie to the counter. Having summoned Darnley to the lying-in chamber, she presented to him the child before those assembled, saying: “My lord, God has given you and me a son whose paternity is of none but you.”</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394716-00021">Darnley was embarrassed, for no one had done more than he, with his jealous loquacity, to spread dishonouring reports about Mary. How was he to respond to his wife’s solemn announcement? To hide his shame, he bent over the infant and kissed it.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394716-00022">Mary, fondly taking the baby boy in her arms and uncovering his face, presented him once more to her husband with the words: “My lord, here I protest to God, and as I shall answer to Him at the great day of judgement, this is your son, and no other man’s son, and I am desirous that all here, both ladies and others, bear witness, for he is so much your son that I fear it may be worse for him hereafter.”</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394716-00023">This was a great and solemn asseveration, and at the same time a strange dread to utter. Even in so weighty an hour, the mortified wife could not conceal her mistrust of Darnley. She could not forget how much he had disappointed and wounded her. After these remarkable words, the Queen turned to Sir William Standen, saying: “This is the prince who I hope shall first unite the two kingdoms of England and Scotland.”</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394716-00024">With some surprise, Sir William answered: “Why, madam, shall he succeed before Your Majesty and his father?”</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394716-00025">“Alas!” said Mary with a sigh. “His father has broken to me.”</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394716-00026">Darnley, thus openly shamed, tried to console his wife, and enquired uneasily: “Sweet madam, is this your promise that you made to forgive and forget all?”</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394716-00027">“I have forgiven all,” rejoined Mary, “but can never forget.”</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394716-00028">After a pause she went on: “What if Faudonside’s pistol had shot? What would have become of him and me both? Or what estate would you have been in? God only knows, but we may suspect.”</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394716-00029">“Madam,” answered Darnley, “these things are all past.”</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394716-00030">“Then,” said Mary, “let them go.”</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394716-00031">That was the end of the conversation, in which words like lightning flashes showed that a storm was brewing. Mary had said no more than half the truth when she declared that she had forgiven though she could not forget. She was not the woman to forgive such an outrage. There would never again be peace in this castle or in this country until blood had atoned for blood, and violence had been requited with violence.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394716-00032">Hardly had the mother been delivered of her babe, between nine and ten in the morning, when Sir James Melville, as always the Queen’s most faithful emissary, set forth to convey the tidings to London. He received instructions, as he relates in his memoirs, “to post with diligence the 19th day of June, in the year 1566, between ten and eleven before noon. It struck twelve when I took my horse, and I was at Berwick the same night.” This was riding post-haste indeed, to cover two days’ journey in half a day, for the customary first halt on the way to London was at Dunbar. He continued with the same express speed. “The fourth day after, I was in London.” There he was informed that the queen was dancing at Greenwich, so, calling for a fresh horse, he hastened thither in order to convey his great news the same night.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394716-00033">Elizabeth, convalescent from a long and dangerous illness, was rejoicing in the recovery of her strength. Lively, animated, raddled and powdered, she looked, in her bell-shaped skirt, like a great tulip amid the circle of her admiring courtiers. Secretary Cecil, with Melville at his heels, made his way through the throng of dancers to the Queen, and whispered in her ear that Mary Stuart had given birth to a son.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394716-00034">In general, as sovereign, Elizabeth was a skilful diplomatist, self-controlled, practised in the art of hiding her true feelings. But this news struck at the woman in her, pierced her like a dagger. For a moment she lost the mastery over her rebellious nerves. So overwhelming was her consternation that her angry eyes and her tight-pressed lips forgot to dissemble. Her face grew rigid; she flushed beneath her make-up; her hands closed convulsively. She ordered the musicians to cease playing; the dance was suddenly stopped; the Queen hurried out of the ballroom. Having reached her bedchamber, when she was surrounded by her agitated ladies-in-waiting, she broke down completely, bursting into tears, collapsing onto a chair and sobbing out: “The Queen of Scotland is mother of a fair son, whereas I am but a barren stock.”</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394716-00035">At no moment during the seventy years of her life was the profound tragedy of her unhappy career more plainly revealed; never did she disclose more openly how stricken to the heart she was by her incapacity for love’s fruition. The bitter awareness of her infertility found vent in the exclamation that burst from the depths of her heart. One feels that she would have given all the kingdoms of this world for a simple, clear and natural happiness—for the happiness of being wholly woman, wholly beloved, wife and mother. Despite Elizabeth’s jealousy she could have forgiven Mary everything but this. To her, who could be neither wife nor mother, it was unpardonable that Mary should be both.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394716-00036">Next morning, however, she was once more wholly the Queen, the politician, the diplomatist. Splendidly did she apply the art in which she was practised, the art of concealing discontent and sorrow behind cold and majestic phrases. When Sir James returned to Greenwich by boat next morning to pay his respects to Her Majesty, he was received by a woman who “had got to show a glad countenance, was clad in her best apparel, and said ‘that the joyful news of the Queen her sister’s delivery of a fair son, which I had sent unto her by Mr Cecil, had delivered her out of a heavy sickness which had holden her fifteen days.’ Therefore she welcomed me with a merry volt, and thanked me for the diligence I had used.” She begged the Scottish envoy to convey her most heartfelt congratulations to Mary, renewed her pledge to become the child’s godmother and, if possible, to be present at the baptism. For the very reason that Elizabeth grudged Mary her good fortune, she wished—always the play-actress eager to convince the audience of her own greatness—to appear before the world as a magnanimous patroness.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394716-00037">Everything seemed to have been admirably settled, and the omens pointed to peace and friendship. On the one hand, it would be impossible for Elizabeth to contest this male heir’s twofold claim to the English succession and, on the other hand, the certainty that her little son would in due time become King of England would bridle Mary Stuart’s impatience for the English crown. Once more the clouds which had from the first hovered over Mary Stuart’s destiny seem to have been happily dispelled, but, as had happened again and again, when life was prepared to give her peace and happiness, her own inmost nature drove her to fashion unrest for herself. A destiny does not acquire meaning and form from the chance happenings of the outer world; “character is destiny”; it is invariably the innate and primal laws of being that shape a life to high issues or destroy it.</p>
