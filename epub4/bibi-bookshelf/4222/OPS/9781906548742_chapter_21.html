         <p class="fp" id="rw-fp_394728-00001"><span class="dropcap">“T</span><span class="sc">HE MATTER MUST COME TO AN END.”</span> Such was the incisive formula in which one of Elizabeth’s ministers of state impatiently summarised the sentiment that prevailed throughout England. Nothing is harder for an individual or a nation to bear than long-continued uncertainty. The assassination of the other great protagonist of the Reformation, William the Silent, who was killed by a Roman Catholic fanatic in June 1584, showed England plainly enough that the poniard had already been sharpened for the heart of Queen Elizabeth. It was a known fact that one conspiracy followed close upon another. The general feeling, therefore, was that the moment had come to make an end of the imprisoned Scottish Queen who laid claim to the throne of England as well, and who was the centre of innumerable conspiracies. The evil must be cut at the roots. In September 1584, the Protestant section of the English nobility and gentry drew up a Bond of Association pledging all good citizens to slay without scruple any conspirator who plotted against the Queen. Furthermore, “pretenders to the throne in whose favour these men conspired” were “to be deprived of all rights as claimants to the succession”, and were to be held personally responsible for such plots. Next the Bond of Association was confirmed by a statute (27 Elizabeth, 1585) entitled <i>An Act for the Security of the Queen’s Royal Person, and the Continuance of the Realm of Peace. </i>Everyone who participated in an attack upon the Queen or who merely sanctioned it became liable to the death penalty. It was further decided that everyone accused of entering into a conspiracy against the Queen should be tried by a jury of twenty-four persons appointed by the crown.
         </p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394728-00001">This gave Mary Stuart plain notice of two facts—first of all, that her royal rank would no longer protect her from a public trial; secondly, that even a successful attempt on Elizabeth’s life would bring her no advantage, but would cost her her own head. This was like the last flourish of trumpets which demands a surrender of an obstinate fortress before the final assault. If there were any further hesitation, no quarter would be given. Ambiguities between Elizabeth Tudor and Mary Stuart were over and done with. There was to be no more shilly-shallying.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394728-00002">There were other signs that the days of a courteous interchange of letters and of amiable hypocrisies were over, that the last round in the long struggle had opened, that there was to be no more consideration shown, that war to the knife had been declared. The English court decided, in view of the unceasing conspiracies against Elizabeth, that Mary Stuart should be more strictly guarded in future. Shrewsbury, being too much of a gentleman to be a good jailer, was “released” from his office. In very truth Shrewsbury thanked Elizabeth on his knees for having restored him to freedom after fifteen years of a jailership that had made him a prisoner as well as Mary. He was replaced in his guardianship by Sir Amyas Paulet, a fanatical Protestant. Now Mary Stuart could, without exaggeration, speak of having been reduced to “servitude”, for her friendly guardian had been replaced by an inexorable jailer.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394728-00003">Amyas Paulet, a hard-bitten Puritan, one of the excessively “just” who model their behaviour upon the Old Testament worthies but who cannot be pleasing to a good God, made no secret of his determination that thenceforward Mary Stuart’s life was to be as uncomfortable as possible. The task of making himself disagreeable, of robbing her of the small favours Shrewsbury had granted her, was a delight to Paulet. He wrote to Elizabeth saying that he expected no mercy should Mary escape from his custody, since such an escape would be possible only through gross negligence on his part. With the cold and clear systematism of one who regards himself as a slave to “duty”, he contemplated the guardianship of Mary Stuart and the making it impossible for her to do any harm as a task assigned to him by God. He had no other ambition than to be an exemplary jailer. He was a new Cato, whom no temptation could lead astray, and no inner promptings of tenderness would ever induce him to modify his harshness. The ailing and weary woman was not, in his eyes, a princess who deserved compassion for her misfortunes, but merely his Queen’s archenemy, who must be treated as Antichrist personified. As for her illness, he wrote cynically: “The indisposition of this Queen’s body, and the great infirmity of her legs, which is so desperate as herself doth not hope of any recovery, is no small advantage to her keeper, who shall not need to stand in great fear of her running away, if he can foresee that she be not taken from him by force.” He fulfilled his task with a malicious delight in his own efficiency, entering his observations of the captive night after night in a manuscript book. Even though history has made us acquainted with more cruel, violent and unjust jailers than Paulet, there is scarce a record of any who was as well able as he to take pleasure in his detestable duties.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394728-00004">His first step was to cut the hidden threads by means of which Mary Stuart had still been able to communicate with the outer world. Her prison house was surrounded by sentries, whose cordon was kept intact by day and by night. The domestic staff, which had hitherto passed freely in and out, and had been able to transmit oral and written messages, had their leave stopped. No member of Mary’s court could go abroad without a special permit, and must then be accompanied by a soldier. Mary was forbidden to continue the bestowal of alms upon the poor of the neighbourhood, Paulet perspicaciously recognising that this pious practice made the recipients ready to smuggle information. The regulations were tightened day by day. Parcels of laundry, of books—whatever passed in or out—were scrutinised as closely as baggage is at a modern custom house, and in this way the possibility of secret correspondence was cut off. Nau and Curie, Mary’s secretaries, sat twiddling their thumbs, for their occupation was gone. They had no letters either to write or to decipher. Neither from London nor from Scotland nor from Rome nor from Madrid did news trickle through bringing hope to Mary in her loneliness. Soon Paulet deprived her of her last enjoyment. Her sixteen horses ate their heads off in Sheffield since she was forbidden the chase or even a ride to breathe the fresh air. Terribly narrowed were the bounds of her existence under Sir Amyas Paulet’s “guardianship”, so that she was at length indisputably imprisoned, and felt as if she were already in her coffin.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394728-00005">It might have been more creditable to Elizabeth had she chosen a less strict jailer for her sister the Queen. Still, as far as seeing to Elizabeth’s immunity from the risk of assassination was concerned, one cannot but recognise that no more trusty watchdog could have been chosen than this cold-blooded Calvinist. Paulet admirably discharged the duty of isolating Mary Stuart from the world. Within a few months she began to feel as if she were kept under a bell glass. Not a word, not a letter, from outside reached her. Elizabeth had every reason to be satisfied with the new jailer, and expressed her most heartfelt thanks to Paulet for all he was doing. “If you knew, my dear Amyas, how much indebted I feel to you for your unparalleled care, how thankfully I recognise the flawlessness of your arrangements, how I approve your wise orders and safe measures in the performance of a task so dangerous and difficult, it would lighten your cares and rejoice your heart.”</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394728-00006">Strangely enough, however, Elizabeth’s ministers of state, Cecil and Walsingham, were to begin with by no means pleased with the “precise fellow”, Sir Amyas Paulet, for his pains. The complete severance of Mary Stuart from her secret correspondence with foreign parts ran counter to their wishes. It did not suit them at all that the Scottish Queen should be deprived of every chance for carrying on conspiracies, or that Paulet, by establishing a cordon round her, was guarding her against the consequences of her own incaution. What Cecil and Walsingham wanted was, not an innocent Mary Stuart, but a guilty one; they wanted her, whom they regarded as the perpetual cause of unrest and plotting in England, to continue her plots until she could be caught in her own net. Their main desire was that “the matter should come to an end”; they looked forward to the trial, condemnation and execution of Mary Stuart.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394728-00007">In their view, the only way of safeguarding Elizabeth was to make an end of her adversary; and since Sir Amyas Paulet, by the rigorous methods he adopted, had rendered it impossible for Mary to initiate any further plots, a plot must be instigated by provocative agents, and the prisoner induced to take part in it. What Cecil and Walsingham required was a conspiracy against Elizabeth, and plain proof that Mary Stuart was involved in it.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394728-00008">As a matter of fact, a plot to kill Elizabeth was ready to their hands. The plot was, so to say, a permanent one. Philip of Spain had established on the continent an anti-English conspiratorial centre; in Paris resided Morgan, Mary Stuart’s confidential agent, supplied with funds from Spain, his business being to carry on unceasing machinations against England and Elizabeth. Here more and more young enthusiasts were enlisted. Through the intermediation of the Spanish and French ambassadors, links were maintained between the malcontent Catholic nobility in England and the chancelleries of the Counter-Reformation. But an important point had escaped Morgan’s notice, namely that Walsingham, one of the ablest and most unscrupulous directors of provocative agents that ever existed, had planted upon Morgan some of his own spies under the guise of devout Catholics, so that the very messengers whom Morgan placed most confidence in were really in Walsingham’s pay. What was planned on behalf of Mary Stuart was betrayed to England, time after time, before any steps had been taken to put the scheme into execution. Now, at the close of the year 1585, when the scaffold was still dripping with the blood of those who were executed for the part they had played in the latest conspiracy, the English authorities became aware that fresh action was about to be taken for the assassination of Elizabeth. Walsingham had a full and accurate list of the names of the Catholic nobles in England who had assured Morgan of their willingness to support any move to put Mary Stuart upon the throne. Walsingham need merely give a sign, and a liberal use of the rack would enable him to fill the gaps in his knowledge.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394728-00009">Walsingham’s technique, however, was more subtle, more far-sighted, and more perfidious. Of course, if he wished, he could nip the conspiracy in the bud. It would not suit his purposes, however, merely to send a few noblemen to the block or to have some of the lesser conspirators hanged, drawn and quartered. What would be the use of cutting off five or six heads of the hydra of this unceasing conspiracy if, next morning, two new heads would have taken the place of each? “Carthage must be destroyed” was Cecil’s and Walsingham’s motto; they were determined to make an end of Mary Stuart; and for this purpose no minor conspiracy would suffice. They would need to prove the existence of widespread activities in favour of the imprisoned Queen of Scots. Instead, therefore, of stifling Babington’s plot in the germ, Walsingham secretly encouraged it; manuring it with good wishes, supplying it with funds, furthering it by assumed indifference. Thanks to his skill as director of provocative agents, what had at first been no more than an amateurish conspiracy of a few country gentlefolk against Elizabeth, developed into the famous Walsingham plot for ridding the world of Mary Stuart.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394728-00010">There must be three stages in the affair if Mary Stuart was to be slain in due form of law. First of all, the conspirators must be induced to commit themselves to a scheme for Elizabeth’s assassination. Secondly, it was necessary that they should acquaint Mary Stuart of their intention. Thirdly (and this was the most difficult requisite), Mary herself must be persuaded to approve the plan, by a document in her own handwriting. Her complicity and her guilt must be proved up to the hilt, for Elizabeth would be dishonoured if Mary were put to death in default of the desired proof. Rather than that, manufacture evidence of Mary’s guilt! Rather than that, cunningly press into her hand a dagger with which she could slay herself.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394728-00011">The work of the English official conspirators against Mary Stuart began by a mitigation of the rigorousness of her imprisonment. Walsingham, it would seem, did not find much difficulty in persuading Sir Amyas Paulet, the pious Puritan, that, instead of maintaining so strict a cordon round Mary as to make it impossible for her to initiate or participate in any conspiracies, it would be better to entangle the royal prisoner in a plot. Anyhow, Paulet modified his treatment of Mary in accordance with the scheme of the English general staff. One day this man, who had hitherto been so inexorable a jailer, came to see Mary and told her, in the most friendly terms, that it had been decided to remove her from Tutbury to Chartley. Mary, little guessing the machinations of her enemies, could not conceal her delight. Tutbury was a gloomy stronghold, more like a prison than a castle; Chartley, on the other hand, was a pleasant place enough, with the added advantage that in the neighbourhood lived Catholic families friendly to her, and from whom she might expect aid. At Chartley she would be able to go out riding once more if her health allowed it, and there perhaps she would have a chance of getting news from her relatives and friends across the seas, a chance (with courage and skill) of regaining what she would prize most of all—her liberty.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394728-00012">Behold, one morning, Mary Stuart was astonished. She could scarcely believe her eyes. As if by magic, Sir Amyas Paulet’s encirclement had been broken through. A cipher dispatch came to hand, the first she had received for months. How clever of her friends to have at length found means for outwitting her inexorable jailer! What an unexpected delight! She was no longer cut off from the world, but would again be kept informed of the plans that were being made to set her free. Nevertheless, some instinct warned her to be cautious, and in her reply to Morgan she advised him: “Keep yourself from meddling with anything that might redound to your hurt, or increase the suspicion already conceived against you in these parts, being sure that you are able to clear yourself of all dealings for my service hithertill.” But this mood of suspicion did not last long. It was dispelled when she learnt by what clever artifices her friends (really they were her intended assassins) would keep up communications with her. Every week a barrel of beer was sent from Burton for the Queen’s servants, and her friends persuaded the drayman to let them replace the bung of the barrel with a corked tube in which letters could be concealed. Thenceforward communications were carried on with the regularity of a postal service. Week after week “the honest man”, as the drayman was styled in the correspondence, brought his barrel of beer to the castle; once it was safely in the cellar, Mary’s butler removed the corked tube which carried the incoming letter, while last week’s empty barrel, in like manner, conveyed an outgoing letter. The honest man, it need hardly be said, was well paid for his services.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394728-00013">But what Mary Stuart did not know was that the drayman was paid over again by the English authorities, and that Sir Amyas Paulet knew all that was going on. It was not Mary Stuart’s friends who had excogitated this method of communication, but Gifford, one of Walsingham’s spies, who had presented himself to Morgan and to the French ambassador as Mary’s confidential agent. Thus Mary’s secret correspondence could be fully supervised by her political enemies. Every letter to or from Mary was, on its way, inspected by Gifford (whom Morgan regarded as his most trustworthy henchman), was deciphered by Thomas Phelippes, who was also in Walsingham’s employ and was clever at ciphers. When the missive had been decoded, a copy was promptly sent to London. This work was done with so much dispatch that the correspondence between Mary Stuart and the French embassy went on briskly without the parties at either end suspecting that it had been tampered with.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394728-00014">Mary Stuart congratulated herself. At length she had outwitted Sir Amyas Paulet, the stiff Puritan, who examined the laundry on its way to and from the wash, had shoe soles inspected, kept her under close observation as if she were a criminal. She smiled as she thought what a rage her jailer would be in if he knew that, despite all his sentries, despite locks and bars, she was week after week exchanging letters with Paris, Madrid and Rome; that her agents were working busily on her behalf; that armies and navies were making ready in support of her cause; that daggers were being sharpened to pierce the hearts of her enemies. Sometimes, maybe, she showed her delight too plainly, thus giving herself away beneath Sir Amyas Paulet’s watchful eyes, now that she was stimulated by the cordial of renewed hope. Paulet, on his side, was much better justified in smiling coldly to himself when, week after week, he saw the fresh supply of beer being brought by the “honest man” (the only name by which this worthy is known), when he noted the haste with which Queen Mary’s butler went down to the cellar to secure the precious letter. Paulet knew that what his prisoner was about to read had long since been deciphered by the English agent, and that copies were on their way to Walsingham and Cecil. These ministers of state would learn from the decoded letters that Mary Stuart had offered the crown of Scotland and the right of succession to the crown of England to Philip of Spain if he would help her to escape. Such a letter, they knew, might be useful in appeasing James VI if he should take it into his head that his mother was being too harshly treated. They read that Mary Stuart, in her holograph dispatches to Paris, was urging the invasion of England by Spanish troops. This would be useful, too, when the Scottish Queen was brought to trial. Unfortunately for their scheme, however, they could not for a long time discover anything in the letters to show that Mary Stuart sanctioned a plan for the assassination of Elizabeth Tudor. The prisoner had not made herself as guilty as Queen Elizabeth’s advisers wished; she had not yet done enough for them to set their murder machine in motion by demanding a public trial of the prisoner; they wanted definite proof of Mary Stuart’s “consent” to the killing of Elizabeth Tudor. To secure this last turn of the screw, Walsingham now devoted his best energies. Therewith began one of the most incredible though documentarily attested acts of perfidy known to history—the “frame-up” by which Walsingham made Mary Stuart privy to a plot of his own manufacture, the so-called Babington conspiracy, which was in reality a Walsingham conspiracy.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394728-00015">Walsingham’s plan was masterly, and was, in a sense, justified by results. What made it so repulsive that, after the lapse of centuries, one’s gorge rises when one contemplates the details, was that Walsingham, to further it, appealed to one of the finest of human qualities, the touching faith of youthful romanticists. Anthony Babington, whom the authorities in London chose as their unwitting tool, merits our sympathy and admiration, for he threw away his life under stress of a noble impulse. A young country gentleman, married and well-to-do, scion of an ancient Northumberland family that later settled in Derbyshire, he lived for the most part on his estate, which was close to Chartley. The reader will readily understand why Walsingham selected Chartley as Mary Stuart’s latest residence. Walsingham had long since known that Babington, a devout Catholic, greatly attached to Mary Stuart, was instrumental in furthering her secret correspondence with foreign parts. It is one of the privileges of youth to be profoundly moved by sympathy for the victims of a tragical destiny. Such an unsuspicious idealist, a “pure fool”, would suit Walsingham’s purposes far better than a hired spy, for the imprisoned Queen would be only too eager to put her trust in young Babington. She knew that he was not moved by pursuit of gain, or by personal fondness for her, but by chivalric sentiment, which in him was accentuated almost beyond the verge of sanity. It is most probably a posthumous and romantic invention, the assertion that Babington had been page to Mary Stuart for a time when she was under Shrewsbury’s custody, and had then fallen to her charms. Presumably he never met her, and served her only from delight in service, from Catholic fervour, from adventurous enthusiasm, all these combining to make him devote himself to the woman whom he regarded as the rightful Queen of England. Heedless, unwary and loquacious, as emotional young people are prone to be, he recruited adherents from among his friends, inducing various individuals of his own creed and station to join him. A strange circle of conspirators was formed, including a fanatical priest named Ballard, a desperado aptly called “Savage” and various young gentlemen with more money than brains, who had read Plutarch’s <i>Lives </i>and entertained cloudy dreams of heroism. Soon, however, their ranks were swelled by clearer-headed and more resolute persons than Babington and his intimates; above all by a certain Gifford, whom Elizabeth was subsequently to reward for his services with a pension of one hundred pounds per annum. The hotheads among them decided that it would not be enough to set the imprisoned Queen at liberty. Impetuously they determined upon a far more dangerous deed—upon the assassination of Elizabeth, the “usurper”.
         </p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394728-00016">The latest adherents to the plot, and the most ardent among the conspirators, were, it need hardly be said, Walsingham’s spies, insinuated among the young idealists as provocative agents; for Walsingham designed, not only to keep himself fully informed as to what was going on, but also, and above all, to jog the elbow of Babington the enthusiast. For Babington, as the documents clearly show, had, with his friends, originally designed nothing more than, from his country house as base, to effect Mary Stuart’s rescue from prison. The thought of murder was foreign to his nature.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394728-00017">But a mere scheme for the carrying-off of Mary Stuart would not suffice Walsingham, would not enable him to send the troublesome prisoner to the block. He needed a full-dress conspiracy for assassination. His agents, therefore, kept up their work of incitation until Babington and the latter’s friends finally agreed to take action along the line desired by Walsingham. On 12th May 1586, the Spanish ambassador, who was throughout in touch with the conspirators, was able to report to King Philip the agreeable tidings that four Catholic gentlemen who were granted the entry to Elizabeth’s court had solemnly sworn to make an end of the Queen with poison or dagger. The provocative agents had done their work satisfactorily; at length Walsingham’s murder-conspiracy was well on the way. But this only fulfilled the first part of Walsingham’s plans. The snare was fastened at one end. The other end needed to be firmly attached. The plot for the murder of Queen Elizabeth had been successfully instigated. Now came the harder part of the business, the securing of the unsuspicious prisoner’s “consent” to the “removal” of her rival. Once more Walsingham whistled up his gang of spies. He sent some of his emissaries to Paris, the headquarters of the Catholic conspiracy, with instructions to complain to Morgan, agent of Philip II and of Mary Stuart, that Babington and company were lukewarm in the cause. They could not make up their minds to the assassination, but hesitated and procrastinated. It was urgently necessary to stimulate their fervour, and nothing could do this so effectually as a word from Mary Stuart. Were Babington once convinced that the Queen he honoured and admired approved the murder, he would be prepared to take action. It was essential, therefore, so the spies assured Morgan, for him to induce Queen Mary to write something that would enhance Babington’s zeal.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394728-00018">Morgan hesitated. One may guess that his suspicions were aroused, that he had glimpsed Walsingham’s game. However, the English minister’s agents persisted in assuring him that nothing more was needed than a few formal lines. At length Morgan gave way; but, to guard against any lack of caution, he sent to Mary a draft of the letter he wanted her to write to Babington. The Queen, who had full confidence in Morgan, copied this missive word for word.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394728-00019">At length the connexion Walsingham desired between Mary Stuart and the conspiracy had been brought about. Morgan’s caution, however, stood him and the Queen in good stead, for Mary’s first letter to the conspirators, though cordial enough, was noncommittal. What Walsingham needed was the Queen’s plain “consent” to the proposed attempt upon Elizabeth’s life. Acting on his instructions, therefore, his agents set to work once more upon the other end of the snare. Gifford made it plain to the unhappy Babington that, now Mary had shown her confidence in him, he must respond by giving the captive Queen a full account of his plan. A thing so dangerous as an attempt upon Elizabeth’s life must not be undertaken without the express approval of Mary Stuart, and, thanks to the weekly visits of the “honest man”, there was a safe way of conveying all necessary information to Queen Mary and of getting her royal instructions in return. Babington, the “pure fool”, with more courage than wit, walked into the trap. He sent a long missive addressed to his “<i>très chère souveraine</i>”<i>—</i>very dear sovereign<i>—</i>disclosing every detail of the plot. Why should not the unhappy Queen be consoled in her captivity by knowing what was afoot? Why should she not be informed that the hour of her liberation was at hand? As unsuspiciously as if his words were to be conveyed to Queen Mary by heavenly messengers, absolutely unaware that whatever he wrote would be read by Walsingham’s emissaries before it would be read by Mary, the poor wretch blabbed the whole plan of campaign. “Myself with ten gentlemen and a hundred of followers will undertake the delivery of your royal person from the hands of your enemies. For the dispatch of the usurper, from the obedience of whom we are by the excommunication of her made free, there be six noble gentlemen, all my private friends, who for the zeal they bear to the Catholic cause and Your Majesty’s service will undertake that tragical execution.” Ardent resolution, and a clear understanding of the risk that was being run, are made plain by this foolish though candid letter, which cannot but touch the hearts of those who read it after the lapse of centuries. Surely it would touch Queen Mary’s heart too? She was not likely to be so cautious or sober-minded as, from cowardice, to refuse answer and encouragement to those who were chivalrously ready to devote themselves to her service.
         </p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394728-00020">It was upon Mary Stuart’s ardour and heedlessness, the qualities she had so often shown, that Walsingham was counting. If Mary approved Babington’s scheme for “the dispatch of the usurper”, Walsingham would have gained his end. Mary would have relieved him from the unpleasant need for compassing the secret murder. She would have walked into the open trap.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394728-00021">The disastrous letter was sent. Phelippes, as usual, deciphered it and sent a copy to Walsingham. The unaltered original, scrupulously resealed, was dispatched to the unsuspecting recipient by way of the beer barrel. On 10th July 1586, it was in Mary Stuart’s hands, when two notables in London, Cecil and Walsingham, the prime movers in this perfidious plot, were eagerly waiting to know how she would reply to it. The moment of greatest tension had come. The fish was nibbling at the bait. Would the tempting morsel be swallowed hook and all, or would it be left uneaten? Well, we must look at the affair for a moment from Cecil’s and Walsingham’s point of view, for some will admire though others will condemn their political methods. However abominable the means Cecil used for the destruction of Mary Stuart, we must remember that this statesman was throughout working for an ideal. He believed that by ridding the world of the hereditary enemy of Protestantism he was merely acting in accordance with an inexorable necessity. As for Walsingham, whose business it was to frustrate plots against his sovereign, we could hardly expect him to be more scrupulous than his adversaries, to renounce espionage and to countenance nothing which persons with more exalted standards would regard as immoral.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394728-00022">What about Elizabeth? Throughout life she gave ample evidence of concern for her reputation before the tribunal of posterity. Are we to suppose that on this occasion she knew how, behind the scenes, a murderous machine was being constructed, more sinister and dangerous than any of the accepted means of public execution? Were these repulsive practices undertaken by her chief advisers with her knowledge and consent? Mary Stuart’s biographer is forced to enquire what part the Queen of England played in this sinister plot against her adversary.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394728-00023">The answer is that Elizabeth played a double role. We have plain evidence that she knew about Walsingham’s machinations; that from first to last she tolerated, approved and perhaps actively furthered the provocative agency of Cecil and Walsingham. History can never acquit her from the charge of looking on and perhaps assisting while the prisoner under her care was being lured to destruction. Still I must reiterate that Elizabeth would not have been Elizabeth if she had acted unambiguously. Capable of any falsehood, any misrepresentation, any form of deception, this extraordinary woman was, nevertheless, not without a conscience, and was never wholly immoral or ungenerous. In decisive moments, her finer impulses were always stirred. Even now she felt uneasy at the prospect of deriving advantage from such base practices. For suddenly, when her ministrants were getting ready to garnish the sacrifice, she made a strange movement in favour of the victim. She sent for the French ambassador, who had been instrumental in conveying Mary Stuart’s correspondence from and to Chartley, without a notion that those whom he employed as messengers were creatures of Walsingham. “Sir,” she said to him roundly, “you are in frequent communication with the Queen of Scotland. I would give you to know that I am aware of all that goes on in my kingdom. I have myself been a prisoner, in the days when my sister Mary ruled this land as Queen, and am therefore familiar with the strange expedients used by prisoners to corrupt servants and effect secret communications.” With these words Elizabeth appeased her conscience. She had conveyed a clear warning to the French ambassador, and therewith to Mary Stuart. She had said as much as she could without betraying her servants. If Mary did not desist from the enterprise, Elizabeth could wash her innocent hands and say proudly: “At any rate I gave full warning at the last moment.”</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394728-00024">But Mary Stuart would not have been Mary Stuart had she allowed herself to be frightened from her intended courses by a warning, if she had learnt to act cautiously and thoughtfully.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394728-00025">Still, to begin with she was content with a brief and noncommittal acknowledgment of Babington’s letter—so brief that her enemies were disappointed, but Phelippes reported to Walsingham: “We attain her very heart at the next.” She hesitated awhile, and Nau, her secretary, urgently advised her against involving herself in so dangerous an affair by putting pen to paper. But the plan was too exciting, the conspiracy too promising, for Mary Stuart to control her dangerous longing for intrigue. “<i>Elle s’est laissée aller à l’accepter</i>”<i>—</i>she allowed herself to agree<i>—</i>remarked Nau with manifest concern. For three days she was closeted in her room with her two secretaries, Nau and Curle, writing a detailed answer to the various proposals. On 17th July, a few days after getting Babington’s missive, she dispatched her rejoinder by the usual route in the beer barrel.
         </p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394728-00026">Phelippes was loitering in the neighbourhood of Chartley that he might decipher this momentous letter forthwith. As chance would have it, one of these days when Mary Stuart was out driving, she caught sight of the rascal, and was struck by his pockmarked countenance. He beamed at her genially, for he knew that the fruit of his labours was about to be garnered. The hopeful Mary fancied he must be one of the emissaries of her friends, come to the neighbourhood in order to prepare the way for her liberation. But Phelippes had a much more urgent and perilous task in hand. As soon as he had taken her missive from its cache, he set to work busily deciphering it. It began with generalities.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394728-00027">Mary Stuart expressed her thanks to Babington, and made three separate proposals for the <i>coup de main</i> which was to get her safe away from Chartley. Of course these matters were not without interest to the spy, but they were not of decisive importance. Then, however, Phelippes’s heart almost stopped beating from delight, for he came to a passage that conveyed what Walsingham so greatly desired, Mary Stuart’s “consent” to the murder of Elizabeth Tudor. To Babington’s remark that “to dispatch the usurper” there were “six noble gentlemen, all my private friends”, prepared to “undertake that tragical execution”, Mary replied unambiguously: “The affairs being thus prepared and forces in readiness both without and within the realm, then it shall be time to set the six gentlemen to work, taking order that, upon the accomplishment of their design, I may be suddenly transported out of this place, and that all of your forces in the same time be on the field to meet me in tarrying for the arrival of the foreign aid, which then must be hastened with all diligence.”
         </p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394728-00028">What more was needed? Thus Mary Stuart disclosed “her very heart”, by approving the plan for the murder of Elizabeth. At length Walsingham’s plot had reached fruition. Commissioners and creatures, masters and servants, could congratulate one another, could clasp one another’s befouled and soon to be bloodstained hands. “Now you have documents enough,” wrote Phelippes triumphantly to Walsingham. Sir Amyas Paulet, likewise, knowing that the execution of Queen Mary would soon free him from his jailership, was filled with pious exultation. “God has blessed my exertions,” he wrote, “and I rejoice that He has thus rewarded my faithful services.”</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394728-00029">Now, when the bird of paradise was caught in the net, Walsingham need no longer hesitate. His plan had proved successful; his unsavoury machinations had been carried to a safe conclusion; but so sure was he of his position that he could not refrain from the gloomy pleasure of playing with his victim for a few days more. If he duly sent the deciphered and copied letter of Mary Stuart to Babington, there would be no harm in giving Babington a chance to answer, and perhaps thereby procuring additional items for the indictment. Something, however, must have made Babington aware that his mysteries were being probed. His courage failed, for the nerves of the most valiant man may give way under stress of an invisible and incomprehensible danger. He ran hither and thither like a hunted rat. Mounting a horse, he rode forth into the country. Then, as aimlessly, he returned to London and (a Dostoevsky touch!) visited Walsingham, the intriguer who was playing with his fate. His obvious intention was to discover, if possible, whether he was suspect. Walsingham, tranquil as ever, disclosed nothing and let Babington take leave unmolested. Perhaps the fool would give additional proof by some act of stupidity. Babington, however, felt that the atmosphere was threatening. He scribbled a note to a friend, using heroic words in the attempt to keep up his courage. “The fiery furnace is made ready in which our faith will be tested.” At the same time he sent a last word to Mary Stuart, telling her to trust and hope.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394728-00030">By now Walsingham had all the proofs he needed, and he struck hard. One of the conspirators was arrested, and this showed Babington that the game was lost. In an outburst of despair he proposed to Savage that they should hasten to the palace and make an end of Elizabeth. But it was too late. Walsingham’s catchpoles were already on their trail, and only for a moment could the pair evade capture. Whither could they flee? The roads were blocked, the ports were watched, they were short of money and provisions. For ten days they hid in St John’s Wood, then a few miles from London, though now not far from the heart of the huge city—ten days of horror. But hunger was pitiless, and at length drove them to a friend’s house, where they received food and where the last sacraments were administered to them. Then they were arrested and led back in chains through the streets of London. The only mercy these two bold young men could expect in the vaults of the Tower was that of the rack, while the bells of the London churches were pealing in triumph. The populace was lighting bonfires and inaugurating processions to celebrate the rescue of Elizabeth, the revealing and foiling of the conspiracy, and the imminent destruction of Mary Stuart.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394728-00031">Meanwhile at Chartley the prisoner had enjoyed a few hours of unfamiliar happiness. Her nerves were tensed. At any hour men might gallop up with the report that the scheme had successfully been carried into effect. Today, tomorrow or the day after, she might be making a triumphal progress to London, where she would be housed in the royal palace. In fancy she pictured the nobles and the burgesses in festal attire, awaiting her at the gates of the city, while the bells pealed jubilantly. She did not know, poor thing, that the bells were already pealing jubilantly to celebrate Elizabeth’s deliverance. In one or two days more her long martyrdom would be ended; England and Scotland would be united under her sovereignty, and all Britain would be restored to the bosom of the Church Universal.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394728-00032">No physician can prescribe a better remedy than hope for an exhausted body or an outwearied spirit. Now that Mary, always credulous and full of hope, felt her triumph to be so near, she seemed completely transformed. She was refreshed and rejuvenated. Though of late years she had continually suffered from fatigue and exhaustion, so that she could scarcely walk any distance without bringing on pain in the side, and was a martyr to rheumatism, she was able once more to swing herself into the saddle. Astonished at this rapid change for the better, at the very time when the conspiracy had been blown upon she wrote to her “good Morgan” as follows: “I thank God that He hath not yet set me so low, but that I am able to handle my crossbow for killing of a deer and to gallop after the hounds on horseback.”</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394728-00033">Being in this cheerful mood of restored health, she welcomed the invitation of the morose Sir Amyas (unaware, she thought, stupid Puritan that he was, how soon his jailership would come to an end!) to participate on 8th August in a stag hunt organised by Sir Walter Aston in his park of Tixall. The weather was unsettled for a week, and it was not until the 16th that Mary, in hunting costume, was able to ride forth, attended by her court chamberlain, her two secretaries, her physician and Paulet himself, who remained unusually friendly. Paulet, however, was accompanied by a sufficient force. A glorious morning, sunshiny and warm, the fields steaming after the recent rain. Mary spurred her horse, to win the full enjoyment of recovered energies. For weeks, for months, she had not felt so young. During all these gloomy years of imprisonment she had not been so cheerful as on this lovely forenoon. Everything looked beautiful to her, all was going well. When hope springs up in the heart, a sense of benediction falls upon the soul.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394728-00034">The cavalcade trotted through the gates of Tixall Park. Now, however, Mary’s pulses began to beat furiously. In front of the castle was waiting a troop of armed horsemen. Were they her friends, Babington and his associates? Had the undertaking hinted at in the correspondence been successfully carried out? But, strangely enough, only one of the waiting horsemen detached himself from the group. Slowly and solemnly he rode up to the Queen, bowed, and raised his hat. It was Sir Thomas Gorges, gentleman-pensioner of Queen Elizabeth. Next moment, Mary Stuart’s joy and excitement were dissipated, for Sir Thomas told her in bald words that Babington’s conspiracy had been discovered, and that he was charged to arrest her two secretaries.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394728-00035">Mary was struck dumb. Any words she uttered might betray her. Perhaps she did not immediately grasp the full extent of the danger, but the cruel truth was soon disclosed to her when she noticed that Sir Amyas Paulet made no move to ride back with her to Chartley. She grasped, at length, the meaning of this invitation to a hunting party. She had been lured away from her house that her rooms might be searched in her absence. No doubt her private papers would be examined. The authorities would raid the diplomatic chancellery over which she had presided almost as openly as if she had still been a sovereign ruler instead of a prisoner in a strange land. She was given plenty of time to think over her blunders and her follies, being detained for seventeen days at Tixall without being allowed to write or to receive letters. She knew that her most intimate secrets must have become known to Cecil and Walsingham, that her hopes had been dashed to the ground. She had been dragged a stage lower, from the position of prisoner to that of accused criminal.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394728-00036">The woman who returned from Tixall to Chartley was in a very different mood from the one who, seventeen days earlier, had joyously set forth from Chartley for Tixall. She did not ride through the gateway at a lively gallop, javelin in hand, surrounded by trusty friends and adherents, but slowly, mute, accompanied only by guardians and enemies, a weary, disappointed, ageing woman, with nothing but misery in prospect. Was she surprised to find that her coffers and drawers had been broken open, and that the documents they contained had been removed? Was it not natural that the few members of the Chartley household who remained loyal to her should welcome her back with tears of affliction? She knew that all was over. But an unexpected incident, a strange call upon her services, helped her through her first despair. Downstairs in the servants’ quarters was a woman in the throes of labour, the wife of Curie, her secretary, who had been taken to London that he might bear witness against her and help to destroy her. Mistress Curie was alone in her extremity, with no doctor to help her and no priest to minister to her. The Queen, therefore, rising to the occasion in the everlasting sisterhood of women and of misfortune, did what she could to help, and (as the Church permits to the lay in such an extremity) herself baptised the new-born infant.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394728-00037">For a few days longer Mary Stuart was detained at Chartley. Then came orders to remove her to a safer hold. Fotheringay Castle was chosen for her new prison, this being the last of the many. Her wanderings were over, and soon her life would be over as well.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394728-00038">But Mary’s sufferings during the last months of her life, tragic though they were, were slight in comparison with the abominable tortures inflicted upon the unhappy young men who had ventured all on behalf of the imprisoned Queen. For the most part historians are affected with a class bias, describing at great length, and often enough exclusively, the distresses of those who sit in the seats of the mighty, the triumphs and tragedies of the rulers of the earth. They ignore the deeds of cruelty done in dark places, the torments inflicted upon sufferers of little note—as if persons of high rank felt more acutely than their “inferiors”. Babington and a number of his confederates (who mentions their names today, although the name and the sad destinies of Queen Mary have been immortalised on countless stages and in numberless books?) endured in three hours of hideous torture more than Mary Stuart had to endure in the twenty years of her misfortune. Traitors in the England of those days were sentenced to be “hanged, drawn and quartered”, and this gruesome penalty was inflicted on Babington and the others with the full approval of Cecil, Walsingham and Queen Elizabeth. After a preliminary hanging the offender was taken down from the gallows while still alive, his sexual organs were cut off, he was disembowelled and was then quartered by the executioner. Among the seven who were thus executed on the twentieth day of September—Babington, regarded as the ringleader, Ballard, a Jesuit, Savage and four others—were two who were little more than boys and whose only offence had been that they had given bread to their friend Babington to aid him in his flight. Even the London mob, not as a rule squeamish, had had its fill of horrors, and murmured at the long-drawn-out barbarity of the execution. Next day, therefore, when “justice” was wreaked upon seven more of the offenders, the horrible procedure was shortened. Once again, however, a place of execution became drenched with blood for the sake of this woman whose magical power it was to lure more and ever more youths to destruction. For the last time! The Dance of Death that had begun with Chastelard had now drawn to a close. No one else, except Mary herself, would perish on behalf of her dream of power and greatness.</p>
