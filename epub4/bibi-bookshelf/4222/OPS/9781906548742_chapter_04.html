What a contrast was this arrival in Scotland with the magnificent send-off she had been accorded when bidding adieu to <i>la douce France</i>! Then she had been escorted by the bravest and noblest gentlemen of the land; princes and counts, poets and musicians, had graced her passage along the roads and at the port, coining courtly phrases and composing rapturous songs in her honour. In Scotland, no one was expecting her, and it was not until she was handed out of the boat and stepped along on firm ground that a few commoners gathered to gape at the dainty apparition. A fisherman or two in their rough working clothes, a handful of loitering soldiers, some shopkeepers and peasants who had come to sell their sheep in the town looked at her and her suite shyly rather than with enthusiasm. They seemed to be asking themselves who these fine folk could be with their sumptuous clothing and display of jewels. Strangers gazed into the eyes of strangers. A rude welcome, hard and austere as are the souls of these northern people. From the first hour of her landing, Mary Stuart was made to see the appalling poverty of her native country, to realise that during the few days of her voyage she had travelled backwards in history at least one hundred years, that she had left behind her a great civilisation, rich and luxurious, wasteful and sensuous, had exchanged the refined and open-handed culture of France for something narrow, dark, and fraught with tragedy. A dozen times and more, the town had been ravaged and plundered by the English, and by Scottish rebels, so that it could boast of no palace or baronial hall wherein Mary might be received with a dignity worthy of her rank. This night, therefore, she was put up in a burgher’s house; simple quarters it is true, but at least the Queen of Scotland had a roof over her head.
         </p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394711-00001">First impressions make a distinctive mark on the mind; they are stamped in deeply, and much of subsequent happenings depends upon whether they are good or bad. Perhaps Mary herself scarcely understood what moved her so profoundly when, after an absence of thirteen years, she returned to her kingdom as a stranger. Could it be homesickness, an unconscious longing for a warm, sweet existence which had taught her to love the French soil? Was it perhaps the shadow cast upon her high spirits by the grey skies of an unknown land? May it not have been a premonition of coming disaster? Whatever the emotion was, Brantôme tells us that hardly did she find herself alone in the room allotted her when she burst into tears. It was not like William the Conqueror, strong in the consciousness of his power, that this poor girl set foot on British earth. Her feeling was one of constraint and perplexity mingled with gloomy forebodings.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394711-00002">Meanwhile, her half-brother, Lord James Stuart (better known to history by his later title, the Earl of Moray, or as the Regent Moray in subsequent years), had been informed of Mary’s arrival, and he in company with some of his fellow noblemen rode with all haste to Leith in order to provide a worthy escort to accompany her on her entry into Edinburgh. But the cavalcade did not cut much of a figure. Under the very transparent pretext of a search for pirates, the English had waylaid one of Mary’s ships. This happened to be the one conveying the favourite palfrey that she used on state occasions, together with the whole of the royal stud. Since the Queen rode well, she would not have been loath to display her equestrian skill to the crowds assembled to see her pass. But being deprived of her own mount, she had to ride into her kingdom sitting on the best horse the town of Leith could provide. A sorry nag, indeed, but serviceable. The mortification was no small thing for a girl of eighteen to face. Her suite fared worse, having to be content with what the stables and stalls of the neighbouring countryside could produce. Again tears suffused Mary’s eyes, tears of wounded pride and regret, for suddenly there was borne in on her the magnitude of her loss the day her husband, Francis II, was taken from her. Also she realised that to be Queen of Scotland was a poor, mean thing when compared with the glory of being Queen of France. Her national pride was piqued at having to cut so wretched a figure before the French gentlemen who accompanied her, and she felt personally affronted at having to present herself for the first time to her new subjects in so pitiable a plight. Instead, therefore, of making a “<i>joyeuse entrée</i>” through the main streets of Edinburgh, Mary decided to stop at Holyrood, which was outside the city walls. Her father had built this palace; its crenellated battlements dominated the landscape, dark and defiant; at first sight it created a formidable impression, with its menacing towers, its clear-cut lines, its square-shaped majesty. But how chill, empty and dismal must it have appeared to a child who had lived amid the voluptuous refinement of the French Renaissance. Here were no Gobelins to cheer and refresh the eyes, no chandeliers reflecting their lustrous illumination in Italian mirrors from wall to wall, no costly hangings, no sheen of gold and silver. Many years had gone by since the place had been used; no laughter re-echoed from its forlorn walls, no kingly hand had cared for or renovated the building since her father’s death. Poverty, the age-long curse of her kingdom, stared down at her from every nook.
         </p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394711-00003">But, night though it was, the inhabitants of Edinburgh had no sooner learnt that their Queen had come than they issued from their houses, determined to give her a suitable welcome. It is not to be wondered at that this welcome seemed uncouth and boorish to Mary and her entourage, used as they were to French brilliancy and polish. Edinburgh’s townsfolk had no festive attire to grace the ceremony, nor did they know how to set up triumphal arches in honour of their young Queen. Here were no “<i>musiciens de la cour</i>” to enchant the ears of Ronsard’s pupil with sweet madrigals and smoothly flowing canzoni. They could only follow the traditional customs such occasions demanded. The country was rich in wood, so what more natural than to construct huge bonfires in the public squares, and by their glare change night into day? They gathered beneath her window and serenaded her with the wild skirling of bagpipes and other outlandish instruments, a sound they called music, but which to her trained ears was nothing but an ugly noise. In addition they raised their rough, manly voices in song; and since they were forbidden by their Calvinistic pastors to sing profane melodies, they filled the air with the lilt of psalms and hymns. With the best will in the world, they were incapable of producing a more soothing lullaby. Nevertheless, Mary Stuart’s heart warmed with the honest love which breathed through these rustic endeavours; the reception was instinct with friendliness towards herself and pleasure at her advent. For decades such harmony had not existed between the sovereign and the people of this distraught and tragical land.
         </p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394711-00004">Neither the Queen, young and politically inexperienced as she was, nor her chief advisers, blinked the fact that unusually difficult tasks lay ahead. Maitland of Lethington, who had one of the shrewdest brains of his day in Scotland, wrote prophetically before Mary returned to her native heath: “It could not fail to raise wonderful tragedies.” Even an energetic man, a man with an iron fist and resolute mind, could not for long impose peace on this unmanageable environment with its chaos of contradictions making for perpetual unrest. How, then, could so joyous and ethereal a young queen, a stranger in these parts, unaccustomed to rule, how could Mary be expected to fare better? A poverty-stricken country, a corrupt nobility that seized upon any and every occasion to rise in arms, a countless number of contending clans on the lookout for a pretext to engage in civil strife, a clergy that was half Catholic and half Protestant fighting for precedence, an alert and dangerous neighbour profiting by fratricidal disputes over the border to feather her own nest, antagonism on the part of the big powers ruthlessly making use of Scotland as catspaw in their bloody game—such was the situation by which Mary Stuart was faced.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394711-00005">At the time of Mary’s return, dissension and discord were at their height. Instead of leaving the treasury full, Mary of Guise had left a veritable <i>damnosa hereditas</i>—an accursed inheritance—no money, and a war of religions which was to become, perhaps, more bitter on this soil than anywhere else in the world. During the years Mary had spent so happily in France, the Reformation had struck deep roots in the Scottish earth, and was almost universally victorious. The cleavage was felt at court and in the home, in villages and towns, throughout whole kinships and families—one half of the nobility and gentry Catholic whilst the other half was Protestant, the towns advocating the new faith, the countryside the old, clan opposed to clan, family opposed to family, and all parties stimulated in their hatred by fanatical priests and by the political ambitions of foreign powers. What constituted the gravest danger so far as Mary was concerned was that the most powerful and influential of her nobles had gone over to the Calvinistic camp; they had made the best of their opportunities and had seized the lands and properties of the old Church while simultaneously weakening the power of the crown, two achievements which made a special and quasi-magical appeal to this rout of ambitious and greedy rebels. They found a specious and ostensibly moral pretext, as protectors of the true faith, as Lords of the Congregation, to set themselves up in opposition to their ruler, and England as usual was not tardy in giving them a helping hand in this endeavour. Though Elizabeth was by nature of a thrifty disposition, she had not grudged spending more than two hundred thousand pounds sterling in financing these traitors, in fomenting rebellion and civil war to undermine the throne of the Catholic Stuarts. Even now, when a truce had been signed, a goodly number of Mary’s subjects were in the secret pay of the English Queen. Of course equilibrium could easily be restored if Mary should consent to embrace the new faith, and some of her advisers urged her to do so. But Mary was not only a Stuart, she was also a Guise. She was a child of the most ardent champions of the Catholic cause and, though not fanatically pious, she was true to the beliefs of her forebears. Never was she to stray from the path of her convictions, no matter the dangers that encompassed her, and, loyal to her own nature, she chose rather perpetual warfare than, in a moment of cowardly weakness, to run counter to the dictates of her conscience.
         </p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394711-00006">Unfortunately this meant that the cleavage between herself and her nobles was irremediable. It is always a fatal thing when a ruler belongs to a different religion from that of the majority of his subjects. The scales cannot vacillate for ever, but must incline definitely in one direction or the other. Thus in the end Mary Stuart was compelled either to make herself mistress of the Reformation or else to bow her head beneath its superior force. The inevitable settlement of accounts as between Luther, Calvin and Rome was, by an extraordinary coincidence, to find a dramatic decision in the fate that awaited her. For the personal struggle between Mary and Elizabeth, between Scotland and England, was decisive also—and this is what makes the struggle so important historically—for the struggle between England and Spain, between the Reformation and the Counter-Reformation.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394711-00007">The ominousness of the situation was aggravated by the fact that the religious dissensions above described extended into Mary’s family, her palace and her council chamber. The most powerful man in Scotland, her half-brother James Stuart, whom she found it expedient to appoint prime minister, was an ardent Protestant and protector of that Kirk which she, being a good Catholic, could not but regard as heretical. Four years earlier he had been the first to append his signature beneath the joint pledge of the Lords of the Congregation “to forsake and renounce the Congregation of Satan, with all superstitions, abominations and idolatry thereto, and moreover to declare themselves manifestly enemies thereto.” What was here called the “Congregation of Satan” was nothing other than the Holy Catholic Church of which his half-sister Queen Mary was a devoted adherent. Thus from the start there was a profound cleavage of convictions between the monarch and her chief minister. Such a state of affairs does not make for peace. For, at the bottom of her heart, the Queen had but one thought—to repress the Reformation in Scotland; whereas James, her brother, had but one desire—to make Protestantism the only religion in Scotland.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394711-00008">James Stuart was to be one of the most notable figures in the life drama of Mary Queen of Scots. Fate had allotted him a leading role which he was destined to play in masterly fashion. A natural son of James V, the fruit of an enduring liaison with Margaret Erskine, who belonged to one of the best families in Scotland, he seemed, no less by his royal blood than by his iron energy, to be the most suitable heir to the throne. Nothing but the political weakness of James V’s position had forced that monarch to refrain from legal marriage with the woman he deeply loved, and (that he might increase his power and fill his purse) to contract a marriage with the French princess who became the mother of Mary Queen of Scots. Thus the stigma of illegitimacy debarred the ambitious youth from the throne. Even though, at the urgent request of James V, the Pope had officially acknowledged James Stuart and five other love children of his father to be of the blood royal, young James was still legally a bastard.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394711-00009">Innumerable times have history and her greatest imaginative exponent, Shakespeare, disclosed the spiritual tragedy of the bastard who is a son and yet not a son, of one whom laws spiritual and laws temporal unfeelingly deprive of a right which nature has stamped on his character and countenance. Condemned by prejudice—the harshest, the most unbending of judges—are these illegitimates, those who have not been procreated in the royal bed, who are treated as inferior to the lawful heirs, though the latter are as a rule weaklings in comparison, because engendered, not out of love, but out of political calculation. They are eternally rejected and thrust out, condemned to beg where they should command and possess. But if the brand of inferiority is visibly placed on a man, the permanent sense of inferiority will either weaken or strengthen him decisively. Such a pressure can break a character or can consolidate it amazingly. Those who are cowardly and half-hearted will be rendered even more so by humiliations of the kind; they will become beggars and flatterers, accepting favours and employment from their officially acknowledged rivals. But in the strong, enforced inferiority will arouse and liberate latent and leashed energies. For the very reason that the direct path to power is not freely opened to them, they will learn to draw power from within their own souls.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394711-00010">James Stuart was a man of strong character. The fierce resolution of his royal ancestors, their pride, and their sense of mastery were continually at work in the hidden recesses of his being. In shrewdness and determination, no less than in clarity of thought, he was head and shoulders above the rufflers who comprised the bulk of the Scottish nobility. His aims were far-reaching, his plans the fruit of profound political thought. No less able than his sister, he, a man of thirty, was enormously in advance of her, thanks to cool-headedness and masculine experience. He looked down upon her as no more than a sportive child who might go on playing so long as her games did not disturb his circles. A man fully grown, he was not, like his sister, a prey to violent, neurotic or romantic impulses; he was not a heroic ruler, but he had the virtue of patience, which gives better assurance of success than can passionate impetus.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394711-00011">Nothing bears stronger witness to a statesman’s political ability and clear-mindedness than his refusal to strive after the unattainable. In Lord James Stuart’s case the unattainable was the kingly crown, since he had been born out of lawful wedlock. He knew only too well that the title “James VI” would never be his, and from the outset he renounced any pretensions he might have to ascending the throne of Scotland. But this initial abnegation made his position, as effective ruler over the realm, all the more secure. Giving up any idea of being invested with the insignia of power or of assuming the title of King, he could henceforward wield real power unmolested. As quite a young man he saw to it that he was well furnished with that tangible form of power: wealth. His father had left him handsomely provided for; he never lost countenance when the question of a gift was raised; he made good use of the wars to fill his pockets, and when the monasteries were dissolved, he saw to it that he was always present at the distribution of the prize morsels. Nor was he reluctant to accept subsidies from Elizabeth. When Mary got back to Scotland, it did not take her long to discover that her half-brother was the wealthiest and most powerful man in the realm, so secure that none could oust him from his position, so mighty that he would constitute one of the most solid pillars of her dominion if she acquiesced in his remaining at the helm, and would be her most dangerous enemy if she ran counter to his will.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394711-00012">Mary Stuart, in her wisdom and necessity, chose to place him on a footing of friendship. Wishing above all to secure her own dominion, she was keen-sighted enough to give him, for the time being, whatever he coveted, and fed his insatiable cupidity for riches and power. It was Mary’s good fortune that her brother’s hands were both strong and supple, for he knew when to hold firm and when to give way. True statesman that he was, James Stuart chose a middle course in his undertakings—a Protestant but no iconoclast, a Scottish patriot and yet keeping in Elizabeth’s good graces, ostensibly a friend of his peers but well aware of the exact minute when they needed to be threatened with the mailed fist, a cool-headed, clear-sighted, calculating individual, with no unruly nerves, incapable of being blinded by the glitter of power, and content only when wielding power.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394711-00013">A personage of such outstanding qualities was an inestimable boon to Mary Stuart so long as he remained in her faction, and a colossal danger so soon as he should become her adversary. Bound to her by the ties of blood, our cheerfully egoistical Stuart had every reason to maintain his sister’s authority so long as it suited his personal interests, for were a Hamilton or a Gordon to step into her shoes he would never be given such a free hand and such unlimited influence over administrative affairs. He could look on calmly while she was ceremoniously presented with crown and sceptre, for real government was in his safe-keeping. But if she should ever try to rule in her own right, if she should ever question his authority, then one form of Stuart pride would rise in revolt against the other form of Stuart pride, and no enmity is more to be dreaded than when similar is confronted with similar, and when both make use of the same weapons against one another.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394711-00014">Maitland of Lethington, Mary’s secretary of state, next only to her half-brother in importance at her court, was also a Protestant. To begin with, nevertheless, he was on her side. Maitland was extremely able, had a supple and cultivated mind, and was (as Elizabeth called him) “the flower of the wits of Scotland”. He had not, like James Stuart, a masterful pride, nor any keen love for power. It was diplomacy that interested him, the confused and confusing intricacies of politics, the art of combination. He took artistic pleasure in these, which mattered more to him than rigid principles, creed and country, the Queen and the Scottish realm. He was personally attached to his sovereign, and Mary Fleming, one of the four Marys, became his wife. To Mary Stuart herself he was neither positively loyal nor positively disloyal. He would serve her as long as chance favoured her, and abandon her in times of peril. From him, as from a weathercock, she could judge whether the wind was fair or foul. A typical politician, he would devote himself, not to her, but to bettering his own fortunes.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394711-00015">Thus, on her return home, Mary Stuart could find no thoroughly dependable friend, whether she sought to right or to left, in the city or among the members of her own household. She had to be content with the services of a James Stuart or a Maitland, to allow herself to be guided by them, and to make the best terms with them. On the other hand, from the moment of her landing, John Knox made no secret of his merciless antagonism. He was the great demagogic leader in religious affairs, the organiser and master of the Scottish Kirk, the most popular preacher in Edinburgh. The struggle with him was one of life or death.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394711-00016">For the shape Calvinism had assumed under John Knox’s inspiration was no longer a purely reformative renovation of the Church, but a brand-new doctrinal system, a kind of superlative Protestantism. Domineering and authoritarian, Knox, the zealot, claimed that even kings must slavishly obey his theocratic laws. Mary Stuart, since she was of a mild and yielding disposition, might have come to a compromise with a High Church, with a Lutheran Church or with any other less virulent form of Reformation. But Calvinism was so dictatorial a faith that from the outset it rendered any kind of mutual understanding impracticable. Even Elizabeth, who favoured Knox because he was her rival’s enemy, detested him for his arrogance. Much more vexatious, of course, were the zealot’s bluster and harshness to Mary, who was in close contact with them, and had so recently returned from the freedom and cheerfulness of France. Nothing could have been more revolting to Mary’s joyous and voluptuous nature and to her delight in the Muses than the austere severity, the hatred of everything that made life pleasant, the iconoclastic antagonism to the arts, the dislike of merriment and laughter, incorporated in the Genevese doctrines; nothing more repulsive than the stubborn treatment of jollity and beauty as sin, than the bigotry which aimed at overthrowing all that she held dear, which banned good spirits and urbane manners and customs, music, poetry and dancing, and which cast a still gloomier mantle over a land already condemned by nature to gloom and sadness.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394711-00017">Under Master John’s aegis, the Kirk in Edinburgh assumed a hard, Old Testament character, for Knox was one of the most iron-willed, most zealous, most mercilessly fanatical of reformers, exceeding even his master, Calvin, in venom and intolerance. He had taken orders as a Roman Catholic priest, and had in the sequel hurled himself with the full ardour of his disputatious soul into the ranks of the reformers, becoming a pupil of George Wishart, who was burnt alive for heresy during the regency of Mary of Guise, at the instigation of Cardinal Beaton. The flames which destroyed his teacher were henceforward to consume Knox’s own heart. As one of the leaders in the rebellion against the Queen-Regent, he was made a prisoner of the French forces and consigned to the galleys. For eighteen months he remained chained to his forced labour, and some of the iron of his chains bit into his soul. On being released through the intervention of Edward VI, he sought out Calvin, from whom he learnt the power enchased in the spoken word, from whom he likewise learnt to hate everything that was bright, cheerful and Hellenic. Within a few years of his return to Scotland his genius for violence enabled him to force acceptance of the Reformation upon lords and commons.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394711-00018">John Knox is perhaps the most finished example of the religious fanatic. He was of harder metal than Luther, who was not free from occasional gleams of jovial humour, and he was yet more rigid than Savonarola, because he lacked the Italian’s brilliancy and faculty for mystically illuminated discourse. Though he was fundamentally honest and straightforward, the blinkers that he wore made him one of those cruel and narrow-minded persons for whom only their own truth is true, only their own virtue virtuous, only their own Christianity Christian. To differ from him was criminal; to refuse compliance with every letter of his demands was to show oneself to be Satan’s spawn. Knox had the dour courage of the self-possessed (in the demoniacal sense of the word), the passion of the ecstatic bigot and the detestable pride of the self-righteous. His acerbity was also tinged by a dangerous pleasure in its exercise, while his impatience manifested a gloomily voluptuous joy in his own infallibility. Jehovah-like, with flowing beard, Hebrew prophet in complete perfection, he took his stand Sunday after Sunday in the pulpit of St Giles’, thundering invectives and maledictions against those who differed from him in the minutest of details. A born killjoy, he railed against the “Devil’s brood” of the happy-go-lucky, of those who did not serve God precisely in the way which seemed best to him. This cold-hearted fanatic knew no other gratification than the triumph of his dogmas, no other justice than the victory of his cause. He frankly rejoiced if a Catholic, or any other whom he regarded as a heretic, was slain or humiliated. Publicly would he thank God when the assassin’s dagger had swept an adversary of the Kirk out of the way. To him it was self-evident that God must have willed and furthered the deed. He vociferated his rejoicings from the pulpit when the news came that pus had burst through one of poor little Francis II’s eardrums, and that the French King was at the point of death. When Mary of Guise died, he did not hesitate to pray for the death of Mary Queen of Scots: “God, for his great mercy’s sake, rid us from the rest of the Guisian brood. Amen, amen.” In his sermons, there was no trace of the suavity and divine goodness characteristic of the Gospels; his discourses swished like a scourge. His God was the vengeful, bloody and inexorable Yahweh of the Old Testament, which, with its barbarous threats, was for him the real Bible. References to Moab, Amalek, all the enemies of the People of Israel who must be annihilated with fire and sword, were continually in his mouth as he voiced threats against the enemies of the true faith—by which he meant his own. When he volleyed abuse at Queen Jezebel, the congregation knew that it was another queen he had in mind. Calvinism, with Knox as its chief exponent, loured over Scotland like a thunderstorm that at any moment might burst.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394711-00019">No compromise is possible with a person thus impeccable and incorruptible, a man whose only thought is to command and who expects instant and unreflecting obedience. Attempts to placate him or smooth him down could only intensify his exactions, make him harsher and more scornful. Always those who regard themselves as God’s doughtiest warriors are the unkindliest men in the world. Believing themselves the vehicles of heavenly messages, they have their ears closed to whatever is humane.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394711-00020">A bare week sufficed to make Mary Stuart aware of the presence of so fanatical an opponent. Before her return she had promised her subjects absolute freedom of belief—a promise which to a woman of her tolerant disposition demanded no sacrifices on her part. In addition she had recognised the law which prohibited any public celebration of the Mass in Scotland. This was a painful concession to John Knox and his followers, but one they insisted upon winning, for, as the divine once said, “one Mass is more fearful to me than if ten thousand armed enemies were to land and suppress the whole religion.” But Mary was a devout Catholic, a daughter of the Guises, and she insisted upon practising her own religion in the privacy of her chapel whenever and however she pleased. Not stopping to reflect upon the possible consequences, the Scottish parliament granted her request. But on the first Sunday after her arrival, when the preparations for celebrating Mass in the Chapel Royal at Holyrood had been made, an excited crowd gathered round the entries, and when the Queen’s almoner was carrying the candles to light upon the altar, he was waylaid and the candles were wrenched from his hands and smashed. A loud murmur arose which reduced itself to a demand that the “idolatrous priest” should be slain; more and more excited grew the cries against this “Satan worship”; at any moment it seemed that the Queen’s private chapel might be stormed by the mob. Lord James Stuart, however, saved the situation. Although himself a staunch champion of the Kirk, he confronted the fanatical rout and defended the main entry while the Queen was engaged in her devotions. After saying Mass in fear and trembling, the unhappy priest was brought safely back to his quarters. Open revolt was thus avoided, and the Queen’s authority had been kept intact, though with difficulty. But the gay festivities that had been organised to greet her arrival, the “joyousities” as Knox mockingly called them, were broken off, much to his grim delight. The young and romantic Queen was made to feel how genuine and strong were the antagonisms extant in the realm she had come over the seas to rule.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394711-00021">Mary Stuart’s reaction to the slight found vent in a storm of rage. Tears and harsh words welled up from within her to express the depth of her mortification. A clear ray of light was thus shed upon a character which hitherto had lacked precision. The spoilt darling of fate ever since birth, Mary had always shown the tender and gentle aspects of her nature, for she was fundamentally of a pliant and accommodating disposition. All who came in contact with her, from the highest court official down to the humblest maid, extolled her friendliness, her lack of arrogance, her affectionate and endearing ways. She won hearts because she never harshly or haughtily reminded people of her majesty. But this gentleness was counterbalanced by an insuperable consciousness of what she really was, a consciousness that was latent so long as nothing came to disturb it, but which broke forth in violent storms of weeping and vituperation so soon as she met with contradiction or resistance. This wonderful woman was often known to forgive a personal affront, but a belittling of her queenly estate never.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394711-00022">She was, therefore, determined not to pass over this initial outrage to her dignity as Scotland’s ruler. Such presumption must, in her view, be stamped upon from the first. Only too well did she know with whom she had to deal, never doubting for a moment that it was the bearded heretic preaching from his parochial pulpit who had incited the rabble against her. She would take the man personally to task, and that without delay. Mary Stuart, accustomed to instant obedience on the part of the subjects of a French monarch, all-powerful ruler by divine grace, never imagined for a moment that she would meet with contradiction from one of her own subjects, an ordinary burgher living in the capital of her realm. She was prepared for everything in the world but that anyone should openly and boldly venture to oppose her will. John Knox, however, was not only prepared to do so, but eager and joyfully prepared. “Why should the pleasing face of a gentlewoman frighten me?</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394711-00023">I have looked in the faces of many angry men, and yet have not been afraid above measure.” His heart bounded within him as with rapid strides he made his way to the palace for this private colloquy. A fight—and in Knox’s opinion, such a fight was in God’s behalf—is the greatest delight the soul of a fanatic can experience. If God Almighty had given crowns to kings, He had endowed His priests and representatives here below with the gift of uttering fiery words and, in addition, the divine right of speaking them. His duty was to defend God’s reign upon earth; nor must he hesitate to use the flail of his wrath to chastise the insubordinate as of yore did Samuel and the judges described in Holy Writ. The scene that ensued was like one taken out of the Old Testament—regal pride confronted sacerdotal pride; it was not one woman fighting one man to gain the upper hand, but two age-old ideas which were engaged for the thousand thousandth time in bitter strife.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394711-00024">Mary Stuart endeavoured to retain her usually unruffled sweetness and to be forbearing. Sincerely wishful to bring about an understanding, she concealed her mortification, for she had at heart to preserve peace in her realm. It was, therefore, with courteous words that she opened the conversation. John Knox, for his part, was resolved to be as implacable as he pleased and to show the “idolatress” that he was not inclined to bow down an inch before the mighty of this world. Silent and gloomy, not as accused but as accuser, he listened to the counts the Queen had against him. Among other items “she charged me with my book” (<i>The First Blast of the Trumpet against the Monstrous Regiment of Women</i>) wherein he challenged a woman’s right to wield authority. This same work had got him into trouble with Elizabeth, the Protestant sovereign, before whose reproaches he had bowed his head with due meekness; now, in the encounter with his own “unpersuaded princess”, he obstinately maintained his privilege to express such opinions as he honestly held. As had been feared, his intolerance seemed bound to mar all, for gradually the conversation took a more caustic turn. Mary showed a “shrewdness beyond her years”, and there was no little acuteness in her reasoning. She asked him point-blank: “Think you that subjects … should resist their princes?” Instead of giving the negative answer she had expected, Knox, a born tactician, evaded the crucial point by lapsing into parable: “A father may be struck with a frenzy, in which he would slay his children. Now, madam, if the children arise, join together, apprehend the father, take the sword from him, bind his hands and keep him in prison till the frenzy be over, think you, madam, that the children do any harm? Even so is it with princes who would murder the children of God that are subject unto them …”

         <p id="rw-p_394711-00025">The Queen was nonplussed by so bold an answer, feeling that by such provisos Knox, the theologian, was for countenancing a revolt against her just rights as sovereign. “Well then,” she retorted briskly, “I perceive that my subjects shall obey you and not me, and will do what they list, and not what I command, and so maun I be subject to them, and not they to me!” This was precisely what Knox had meant, but he was too cautious to say so outright, seeing that Lord James Stuart was present at the interview. Evasively he replied: “God forbid that ever I take upon me to command any to obey me, or set subjects at liberty to do what pleaseth them. My travail is that both princes and subjects may obey God … He craves of kings that they be as foster-fathers and queens as nursing mothers to his Church.” The Queen, sorely vexed by the reformer’s persistent ambiguity, made sharp rejoinder: “But ye are not the Church that I will nourish. I will defend the Church of Rome, for I think it is the true Church of God.”</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394711-00026">Blow swiftly followed upon blow. The point had been reached where understanding between a zealous Catholic and a fanatical Protestant, one who “ruleth the roost” and of whom “all men stand in fear”, was impossible. With the rough manners begotten of unceasing controversy and polemic, he retorted: “Your will, madam, is no reason; neither doth your thought make that Roman harlot to be the true and immaculate spouse of Jesus Christ.” And when Mary rebuked him for the use of such words, and pleaded conscience, Master John retaliated provocatively: “Conscience, madam, requires knowledge, and I fear that right knowledge ye have none.” Thus the first interview, instead of bringing reconciliation, only served to make the antagonism between the two more pronounced. “In communication with her I espied such craft as I have not found in such age. Since, hath the court been dead to me and I to it.” Mary had been made to realise that there were limits to her royal power. With head erect, Knox left the audience chamber, proud and pleased at having defied majesty. The young Queen, on the contrary, felt discomfited, knowing that her overtures had received a rebuff. She recognised her own impotence, and gave way to her bitterness of soul in a passion of tears. Nor were these the last she was to weep. Soon she was forced to recognise that power was not a thing inherited once and for all, but had to be fought for in persistent struggle and amid constantly renewed humiliations.</p>
