When one of a regal type of character loves, this implies unrestricted self-surrender and expenditure without thrift. During the first weeks of her marriage, Mary found it impossible to do enough to show her fondness for her young husband. Every day she surprised Darnley with some new gift—now a horse, now a suit of clothes; a hundred small and tender things, to follow up the bestowal of the greatest things in her power to bestow—the royal tide and the warmth of her heart. Reporting to London, Randolph, the English ambassador, wrote: “All honour that may be attributed unto any man by a wife, he hath it wholly and fully. All praise that may be spoken of him, he lacketh not from herself. All dignities that she can indue him with are already given and granted. No man pleaseth her that contenteth not him; and what may I say more? She hath given over unto him her whole will, to be ruled and guided as himself best liketh.” Mary Stuart was not one to do things by halves; she gave with both hands. Now that she was passionately in love, she was wholly obedient and ecstatically humble.
         </p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394715-00001">Great gifts, however, are advantageous only to one who is worthy of them; for others, they are dangerous. Strong characters become yet stronger through a sudden accession of power, since power is their natural element; weak characters, on the other hand, are ruined by unmerited good fortune. Triumph, instead of teaching them humility, makes them arrogant; and, childish in their folly, they believe that the favour of fortune is a testimony to their own worth.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394715-00002">It was not long before Mary’s unrestrained and voluptuous delight in giving proved disastrous to this narrow-minded and vain youth, who still stood in need of a tutor instead of becoming the master and lord of a generous and high-spirited queen. For as soon as Darnley perceived what power he had gained, he became pretentious and overbearing. He accepted his wife’s gifts as nothing more than tributes due to him and took the guerdon of her royal love as something that accrued to him by right as a man. Having become a master, he felt entitled to treat his wife as a slave. A poor creature with a “heart of wax” (to quote Mary’s own contemptuous words about him later), the spoilt lad threw off all restraint, suffered from what would nowadays be called “swelled head”, and meddled autocratically in affairs of state. The courtliness and modesty that he had assumed in the days of his wooing were now discarded as superfluous. It was no longer necessary for him to write verses to Mary, or to be gentle in his manner. At the council he assumed dictatorial airs, speaking rudely and loudly; he drank deep with his boon companions, and on one occasion, when the Queen tried to withdraw him from unworthy associates, he berated her so shamefully that the poor woman, thus publicly humiliated, burst into tears. Since his wife had granted him the title of King (the title and nothing more), he believed himself to be in very truth a king, and impetuously demanded the “crown matrimonial”, that is to say joint powers of rule. Indeed, this beardless lad of nineteen was already dreaming of autocracy, of becoming the sole and irresponsible head of the Scottish realm. Yet everyone knew that his presumption was not backed up by any effective will, that a conceited boy was intoxicating himself with his own rodomontade, and that the braggart believed himself to be a man because he displayed the arrogance of an upstart. Inevitably, before long, Mary herself came to recognise, with shame, that her first and most devoted love had been squandered upon one who was both ungrateful and unworthy.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394715-00003">Now, in a woman’s life, there can be no worse humiliation than to discover she has given herself to one who does not deserve or appreciate the gift, and never will a true woman pardon either herself or the man for so gross a mistake. When the love passion has once flamed high between a man and a woman, it would be unnatural were it to lapse into mere coolness and smooth civility; love, in cases of bitter disappointment, is speedily metamorphosed into hatred and contempt. Thus Mary Stuart, who was never one to show moderation in her feelings, having recognised Darnley to be a pitiful specimen of mankind, withdrew her favour from him more suddenly and swiftly than a thoughtful and calculating woman would have done. She swung from one extreme to the other. Piece by piece, she took away from Darnley what she had unreflectingly, uncalculatingly, given him in the first flush of passion. There was no more talk of his being effective joint ruler, of the “crown matrimonial” which in former days she had conceded to her sixteen-year-old husband Francis II. Wrathfully, Darnley became aware that he was no longer summoned to important sittings of the council, and he was enraged when he was forbidden to include the royal emblem in his coat of arms. Instead of becoming the autocrat he had hoped to be, he found that he had been degraded to the position of prince consort, and that instead of, as he had dreamt, playing the chief part, he was, at court, barely allowed a consultative voice. Soon his wife’s contemptuous treatment of him was copied by the courtiers. Rizzio no longer showed him state documents and, without consulting him, signed the Queen’s letters with the “iron stamp”. The English ambassador refused to address him as “Your Majesty”. At Christmas, only six months after the honeymoon, Randolph reported “strange alterations” at the Scottish court. “Until recently it was the custom here to speak of the King and the Queen, but of late Darnley has only been spoken of as the Queen’s husband. He had grown accustomed to see his name put first beneath all edicts, but now it occupies the second place. Not long ago, coins were struck bearing the joint heads of ‘Henricus et Maria’, but they have been withdrawn from circulation and new ones have been issued … Some private disorders there are among themselves, but because they may be but <i>amantium irae</i> or household words as poor men speak, it maketh no matter if it grow no further.”
         </p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394715-00004">But it did grow further. To the slights which the paper King had to suffer in his own court were now superadded the more grievous slights of a husband who believes himself betrayed. For years past, Mary, upright though she was by nature, had had to learn that lying is needful in politics, but she remained unable to counterfeit where her personal feelings were involved. As wife, she must give herself wholly or not at all. Lukewarm emotions and half-heartedness were impossible to her. As soon as it had become clear to her that she had given the treasure of her love to a worthless wight, directly the fancied Darnley of the honeymoon had been replaced by a foolish, vain, impudent and ungrateful youth such as Mary’s husband actually was, physical attraction was replaced by physical repulsion. It was now intolerable to her to go on surrendering her body to this man from whom her heart had been estranged. The instant she was aware of being with child, she began to shun Darnley’s embraces on any and every pretext. She was ailing, she was tired; she could always find some such reason for refusing herself to him, and whereas, during the first months of their married life (Darnley, in his anger, revealed these connubial privacies), Mary had been the more forthcoming of the two, she now shamed her husband by frequently rejecting his advances. Even in this most intimate sphere, where he had first won power over her, Darnley, to his profound mortification, found himself deprived of the ordinary privileges of a husband.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394715-00005">He lacked the moral strength to keep his frustration to himself. He shouted it from the housetops, chattered about it in every tavern, raged and threatened, talked fatuously of revenge. But the more bombastic his language, the more absurd an impression did he produce until, within a few months, the royal title notwithstanding, he was regarded as nothing better than a tiresome and capricious outsider to whom the courtiers showed the broad of their backs. No longer did people incline their heads reverentially; they merely smiled when Henricus rex Scotiae voiced his demands. To one who is or would be a ruler, however, universal contempt is more dangerous than universal hatred.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394715-00006">Mary’s disappointment in Darnley was political as well as the disappointment of a loving woman. She had hoped that, with the aid of a husband who would be devoted to her body and soul, she would at length be able to shake off the tutelage of Moray, Lethington and the Scottish lords in general; she had dreamt of ruling Scotland jointly with her beloved. But these illusions, likewise, had vanished with the honeymoon. For Darnley’s sake, she had estranged Moray and Lethington, with the result that she was now utterly alone. But a woman of such a nature as hers, however profoundly her hopes have been belied, cannot live without a confidant, so she was continually looking round her for someone upon whom she could unconditionally rely. Better, she thought, that it should be a man of low rank, lacking the prestige of a Moray or a Lethington, but having, in place thereof, a virtue which was more essential to her at the court of Scotland—absolute loyalty, the trustworthiness which is the most precious of boons in a servitor.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394715-00007">Chance had brought such a man to Scotland. When Marchese Moreta, the Savoyard ambassador, visited Scotland, there came in his train a young Piedmontese, David Rizzio by name, “in visage very black”, about twenty-eight years of age, with round, alert eyes and a lively mouth—that of a good singer. (“<i>Particolarmente era buon musico</i>”—He was an especially good musician.) Poets and musicians were always welcome guests at Mary’s court. Both her father and her mother had transmitted to her a passion for the fine arts. Nothing could better relieve the gloom of her environment than the strains of the lute or the violin, as accompaniment of a good voice. It happened, at the moment, that she was short of a basso, and since “Seigneur Davie” (as he came to be called by his intimates at the Scottish court) was not only a competent bass, but a fairly skilled composer, the Queen begged Moreta to allow the “<i>buon musico</i>” to remain behind in her personal service. Moreta had no objection, so Rizzio was appointed, at a salary of sixty-five pounds. In the palace account-books is inscribed “David le Chantre”, but among the domestic staff he was known as “<i>valet de chambre</i>”—groom of the chamber. In those days there was nothing degrading in such a designation for a musician, seeing that down till Beethoven’s time the greatest of musicians were at court accounted as no more than members of the domestic staff. Even Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and the old white-haired Haydn, though famed throughout Europe, never sat at meals among the nobles and princes, but took their food in the servants’ hall.
         </p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394715-00008">Rizzio was not merely a young man with a fine voice. He had a shrewd intelligence, a lively wit and an all-round artistic education. He spoke Latin and French fluently, as well as his native Italian; he wrote a “fair hand” and in a good style; those of his sonnets which have been preserved are tasteful and correct. Soon an opportunity occurred for promoting him from the servile rank. Paulet, Mary’s private secretary, had not proved immune to a malady that was endemic at the Scottish court, namely corruption by English gold. The Queen was forced to dismiss him at short notice. The vacant place in the Queen’s study was promptly filled by David Rizzio, who now rose rapidly at court. Soon he was something more than a secretary—he became Her Majesty’s adviser. No longer did Mary Stuart dictate her letters to the Piedmontese secretary, for the latter drafted the epistles as he thought best. The precise nature of the diplomatic negotiations in which he became engaged under these circumstances, and whether he worked exclusively in the Scottish interest or also had an eye to the advantage of foreign powers, will probably never be known. This much is certain, that he came to play a more and more important part in state affairs. As we have seen, he had a good deal to do with his royal mistress’ marriage to the Catholic prince consort Darnley, and Mary’s stubborn refusal to pardon Moray and the other rebel lords was ascribed by the latter, probably with good reason, to Rizzio’s influence. Suspicion had been rife that the young Piedmontese was a papal agent at the Scottish court. How much truth there may have been in this idea must remain uncertain. Beyond question, even if Rizzio was devoted to the papal and to the Catholic cause, he served Mary Stuart with a devotion and loyalty that had not been shown by any of her Scottish subjects. Now when Mary was faithfully served, she knew how to reward, and she was wont to give freely to anyone with whom she could converse frankly. She made her favour for Rizzio all too plain, giving him costly apparel, entrusting him with the Great Seal of the realm and making him acquainted with state secrets. Before long David Rizzio, the sometime servant, rose to be a great gentleman, sitting down at table with the Queen and her ladies, helping as <i>maître de plaisir </i>like Chastelard before him (an ominous parallel!), organising musical festivals and other court diversions, and becoming more and more the Queen’s close friend instead of merely her servitor. Until far on into the night, envied by the domestic staff, this low-born foreigner was closeted with the Queen in her private apartment. In princely attire, arrogant and offhand, the man who had arrived in Edinburgh as little better than a lackey and with nothing to recommend him but a fine voice now exercised the highest functions in the realm. He had more influence in such matters than Darnley the Queen’s husband, more influence than Moray when prime minister—the “<i>buon musico</i>” who was actual chief of the state. Nothing happened without his knowledge and consent, but this knowledge and this consent were honestly subservient to the Queen’s interests.
         </p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394715-00009">As a second sturdy pillar of her independence, the military power as well as the political was now in trustworthy hands. In the former domain, likewise, she had found someone to serve her faithfully, the Earl of Bothwell, who years before, in early youth, had (though a Protestant) espoused the cause of Mary of Guise against the Lords of the Congregation, and had therefore been driven from Scotland by the enmity of James Stuart. Returning to his country after Moray’s rebellion and downfall, Bothwell put his powers, which were far from inconsiderable, at the Queen’s disposal. A bold soldier, prepared for every hazard, a man of iron nature, passionate both in love and in hatred, Bothwell was devotedly served by the border clansmen, whom he had led in many a guerrilla campaign against the English. His person alone was worth an army. Grateful for his support, Mary confirmed him in the hereditary appointment of Lord Admiral of Scotland.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394715-00010">With these two loyal assistants to rely upon, Mary Stuart, at twenty-three, had at length both the chief implements of power, the political and the military, firmly grasped in her hands. For the first time she could venture to rule alone, and she was never a woman to shrink from risk.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394715-00011">Always, however, in Scotland, when the monarch endeavoured to become an effective ruler, the Scottish lords resisted his will. Nothing could be more distasteful to these insurrectionary-minded nobles than a queen who neither wooed their favour nor was afraid of them. From England, Moray and the other outlaws were clamouring for permission to return. They exploded all possible mines, those of silver and gold as well as the others. The discontent of the nobility was concentrated upon Rizzio, and soon their castles were full of the murmur of scandalous tongues. The Protestants in Holyrood were convinced that the Italian was spinning Machiavellian webs. They suspected rather than knew that Scotland was about to be dragged into the secret schemes of the Counter-Reformation, and it is indeed possible that Mary had given some such pledge to her relatives the Guises who, a few years later, were to found the Catholic League.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394715-00012">Rizzio, having no longer a friend at the Scottish court, was held responsible for these plots. The shrewdest of mortals often act most imprudently. Rizzio made the usual mistake of upstarts. Instead of modestly concealing his power, he boastfully displayed it. He wore splendid attire, bestowed costly gifts, made those with whom he had as a newcomer sat in the servants’ hall feel how high he had risen above them, and he does not seem to have been himself exempt from corruption by presents. What, in any case, could be more insufferable to the Scottish nobles’ pride than that an ex-servant, a strolling musician of dubious origin, should spend hour after hour in the Queen’s private apartments, adjoining her bedchamber, in the most intimate companionship which was denied to them, the bearers of ancient names? Stronger and stronger grew their suspicions that these secret conversations must concern an attempt to make an end of the Protestant power in the country and, to be beforehand with the Queen, a number of the nobles who were devoted to the Reformed religion joined in a conspiracy.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394715-00013">For centuries the Scottish aristocracy had been accustomed to employ one method, and one only, for dealing with their adversaries—murder. Not until the spider which was spinning these secret threads had been crushed, not until the subtle and inscrutable Italian adventurer had been swept out of their path, would the way be opened for rendering Mary Stuart more pliable. The plan for making a violent end of Rizzio must have been conceived some months in advance, at the time when Randolph reported to Elizabeth that the Italian might expect at God’s hand either a speedy end or an intolerable life. It was long, however, before the malcontents could summon up courage to begin a definite rising. The speed and firmness with which Mary had suppressed the last rebellion was still fresh in their memories, and they had little inclination to share the fate of Moray and the other exiles. They also dreaded the iron hand of Bothwell, who loved to strike hard, and whose pride, they knew, would keep him from joining in their plot. They could only murmur among themselves and clench their fists until at length one of them thought of the brilliant but devilish plan of transforming Rizzio’s murder from a rebellious act into a legal and patriotic deed by making Darnley, the titular King of Scotland, head and front and protector of the conspiracy.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394715-00014">At the first glance the notion seems absurd. Involve the king of a country in a conspiracy against his own wife, the king against the queen? But the scheme proved psychologically sound, for in Darnley’s case, as in that of all weaklings, the mainspring of his activities was his measureless vanity. Since the “iron stamp”, the facsimile of the Queen’s signature, had been confided to Rizzio’s charge, the friendship between the two men had been broken, for the right to sign documents in Mary’s name gave Rizzio powers which Darnley coveted on his own account. Was this beggar on horseback to conduct diplomatic negotiations about which Darnley, Henricus Scotiae, was not informed? The secretary was wont to stay in the Queen’s room until one or two in the morning—to spend there the midnight hours when a husband had the right to demand his wife’s company—and the Italian’s power grew from day to day as, in the sight of the whole court, Darnley’s diminished. It must be Rizzio’s fault that the crown matrimonial had been refused him, and that alone would have sufficed to explain the hatred of a man who was no less mean-spirited than mortified. But the Scottish nobles instilled a yet more virulent poison into the open wound of Darnley’s vanity, stimulating him where he was most sensitive, in his virile jealousy. By numberless hints they encouraged his suspicion that Rizzio shared not only the Queen’s board, but also her bed. Though there was no proof of any such misconduct, Darnley was the readier to believe the tale because his wife had of late refused conjugal embraces. It was a hateful thought that Mary’s aloofness must be due to a preference for this black-haired musician. A man whose feelings have been wounded is easy to enrage, and one who does not trust himself is apt to distrust others. Ere long Darnley was convinced “that he had suffered the greatest dishonour which can be inflicted on a man.” The incredible became fact; the King assumed the leadership of the conspiracy against the Queen.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394715-00015">It has never been proved, nor is ever likely to be proved, that this swarthy little musician David Rizzio was really the Queen’s lover. The very fact that Mary showed open favour for her private secretary in face of the whole court speaks against the supposition. Even if we admit that there is but a narrow line separating spiritual intimacy between a man and a woman from carnal relationship—a line which can be crossed in any incautious moment or as the outcome of an unconscious gesture—still, as regards Rizzio, Mary Queen of Scots, a woman with child, showed her royal friendship with such confidence and carelessness as would have never been shown in such circumstances by an adulteress. Had the pair really crossed the aforesaid line to become lovers, Mary’s first and most natural thought would have been to avoid giving tokens of manifest intimacy; she would not have made music or played cards with her lover until the small hours in her private apartment; nor would she have secluded herself with him in her study when diplomatic correspondence was being indited. But as had already been shown in the case of Chastelard, one of her most gracious qualities was a danger to her—her absolute self-confidence when she knew herself to be blameless, her contempt for what “they say”, her sovereign disregard of gossip, her amiable nonchalance. Almost always incaution and courage go together, as virtue and danger, like the obverse and reverse of a coin; it is only cowards and those who are unsure of themselves that dread the semblance of guilt.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394715-00016">But when rumour has once charged a woman with misconduct, however malicious and nonsensical the rumour may be, it continues to spread, being perpetually nourished by malicious curiosity. Forty years later, Henry IV of France was to keep the ball of calumny rolling, for he said mockingly of his fellow sovereign James I (whom, as a babe, Mary was now bearing in her womb) that he well deserved the name of “Solomon” because, like King Solomon of old, he was a son of David. For the second time Mary’s reputation was gravely damaged, not by any fault she had committed, but by her lack of caution.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394715-00017">At the Scottish court, no one took this fable seriously; for afterwards, when the nobles were publicly accusing Mary Stuart of all possible crimes, they simultaneously declared her son James to be the rightful King of Scotland. Hate her though they did, they knew the truth of this matter. Only in Darnley, irritated beyond endurance, his judgement confused by an inferiority complex, did the suspicion take root and grow rankly. Like fire, it coursed through his veins; like a bull, he charged the red cloth waved in front of his eyes, and entered blindly into the plot. Without stopping to reflect, he allowed himself to be entangled in a conspiracy against his own wife, so that within a few days no one thirsted more ragingly than he for the blood of Rizzio, who had been his close friend, who had shared bed and board with him—the insignificant musician from Italy who had helped Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley to a crown.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394715-00018">Among the Scottish nobles of those days, political assassination was a solemn affair. Those who had determined on it did not rush hastily upon their victim in the first blast of anger. The conspirators entered into a formal bargain. Word of honour was not security enough for them, for they knew one another too well. This remarkable scheme of chivalry had to be contracted for with seal and charter, as if it had been a legal undertaking. When the Scots had determined on violence, the details were clearly stipulated on parchment, upon one of the so-called “covenants” or “bonds” in which the princely bandits pledged themselves to abide by one another through weal or woe—for only as a troop, as a clan, did they feel courageous enough to rise against their sovereign lady. This time, as a novelty in Scottish history, the conspirators were honoured by having a king’s signature upon their covenant. Between Darnley and the conspirators two bonds were entered into and duly signed, bonds in which the King who had been cold-shouldered and the lords who had been banished reciprocally pledged themselves to overthrow the authority of Mary Stuart. In the first bond Darnley promised to hold the conspirators “shaithless” (unharmed), and to protect and defend them even in the palace and in the presence of the Queen. He further agreed to recall the banished lords from outlawry and to overlook their “faults”, on condition “that they would procure for him the crown matrimonial of Scotland, and that, in the event of Queen Mary’s death, he should be declared her rightful successor, and his father the next heir after himself; and that the lords would pursue, slay and extirpate all who opposed this resolution.” He also promised to defend the Kirk against any diminution of its rights. In the second bond the conspiring lords pledged themselves to procure for Darn-ley the crown matrimonial, and even (we shall see why this possibility was considered) in the event of the Queen’s premature death to leave Darnley in possession of the royal rights. These words, seemingly plain, implied more than Darn-ley realised. But Randolph, who saw the text of the bonds, understood well enough, reporting to London: “If persuasion to cause the Queen to yield to these matters” (the resignation of the crown) “do no good, they purpose to proceed we know not in what sort.” This is a broad hint of the intention of the conspirators to rid themselves of Mary during the chance medley of which Rizzio’s assassination was the avowed object.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394715-00019">Hardly was the ink dry upon the signatures to this iniquitous bargain, when messengers galloped off to inform Moray, who was at Newcastle awaiting the issue of the plot, that he might make ready for his return to Scotland, while Randolph, who was likewise across the border at Berwick, and was actively participating in the conspiracy, hastened to inform Elizabeth of the bloody surprise which was preparing for her royal sister. On 13th February 1566, several weeks before the murder, he wrote to London:</p> 
         <div class="block extract" id="rw-block-extract_394715-00001">
            <p id="rw-p_394715-00020"><i>I now know for certain that the Queen regrets her marriage, and hates her husband and all his kin. I know also that he believes he will have a partaker in his play and game, and that certain intrigues have been going on between father and son to seize the crown against her will. I know that if these come to fruition, David, with the King’s assent, will have his throat cut within the next ten days.” The spy went on to convey fuller knowledge of that at which he had already hinted. “Even worse things than these have come to my ears, actually proposals for attacking her own person.</i>
            </p>
         </div> 
         <p class="fp" id="rw-p_394715-00021">There can then be no doubt that the conspiracy had more extensive aims than those disclosed to the foolish Darnley; that the blow which was ostensibly directed against Rizzio alone was intended to destroy Mary as well, so that her life was just as much in peril as her secretary’s. Darnley, however, being cruel, as cowards always are when they win power, was blindly longing for vengeance upon the man who had wormed his way into Mary’s confidence, and who signed documents in her name. He insisted, therefore, wishing to debase his wife as much as possible, that the murder must take place in her presence; being moved by the illusion of a weakling, who hopes that “punishment” will make a strong nature pliable, and believing that a brutal exhibition of force would render once more submissive the wife who had come to despise him. Such crude and vengeful natures as his are capable of the last extremity of baseness. The conspirators acceded to the wretched creature’s desire that the slaughter should take place in Mary’s apartment, and in her presence, with child though she was. The 9th of March was chosen for the deed, whose performance was to prove even more abominable than its planning had been.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394715-00022">While Elizabeth and her ministers in London had for weeks been fully informed of the details (though the English Queen had no thought of conveying a friendly warning to her cousin and “good sister”), and while Moray was waiting across the border ready to spring into the saddle and John Knox had already prepared the sermon in which he was to extol the murder as “a deed most worthy of all praise”—Mary Stuart, betrayed on every hand, was utterly without forebodings and void of suspicion. During the last few days Darnley, making treachery more hideous by simulated affection, had been kindlier than usual, so that there was nothing to show, at sunset on the appointed day, what a night of horror was awaiting her with its promise of doom that would overshadow her for years to come. Rizzio had received an anonymous warning, to which he paid no heed, for in the afternoon when Darnley came to ask him to play a game of tennis, the musician cheerfully accepted the invitation of his former comrade.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394715-00023">Now it was dark. Mary, following her usual custom at this period, had commanded that supper be served in the turret chamber adjoining her bedroom on the first storey of the tower. It was a little cabinet, fitted only for the entertainment of a small company—a few nobles and Mary’s half-sister were seated round the heavy oaken table, which was lit by wax candles in silver candelabra. Opposite the Queen sat David Rizzio, dressed as a fine gentleman, his head covered (the French fashion in those days), and wearing a coat trimmed with damask and fur. He was in a cheerful conversational vein, probably expecting that there would be some music after supper, or that in some other way the time would be passed pleasantly. There was no sign of anything unusual—until the tapestry which veiled the Queen’s bedroom was drawn aside and Darnley, the King, the husband, entered. Everyone rose to greet him; place was made for the distinguished guest at the crowded table, beside his wife, round whom he put his arm affectionately, kissing her with a Judas kiss. Lively talk was resumed; plates rattled and glasses clinked; then there was some agreeable music.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394715-00024">But again the hangings were drawn aside. Now all were amazed, angered and startled, for this time the newcomer, looking like a black angel in full armour, naked sword in hand, was one of the conspirators, Patrick, Lord Ruthven, generally dreaded and believed to be a sorcerer. His face was ghastly pale, for he was dangerously ill, in a high fever, and had only left his bed in order to participate in the night’s fell work. His fiery eyes disclosed a fierce determination. The Queen, instantly boding ill—for no one except her husband was entitled to use the private spiral staircase, the “limanga”, leading from Darnley’s ground-floor apartment into her bedroom—asked Ruthven by what right he forced himself unannounced into her presence. Cold-bloodedly and contemptuously he answered: “There is no harm intended to Your Grace, nor to anyone but yonder poltroon, David; it is he with whom I have to speak.”</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394715-00025">Rizzio turned pale beneath his plumed cap, and clasped his hands together beneath the table. He instantly realised what was coming. None but his sovereign, none but Mary, could now protect him, since Darnley made no move to rebuke the presumptuous Ruthven, but sat looking on unconcerned. Now Mary spoke in answer to the intruder:</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394715-00026">“What hath he done?” she enquired.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394715-00027">Ruthven shrugged his shoulders and answered:</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394715-00028">“Ask the King your husband, madam.”</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394715-00029">Mary involuntarily turned to Darnley. But in this decisive hour the weakling, who had for so long been urging others to the deed of murder, lost heart. He had not the courage to take his place by Ruthven’s side. Feigning ignorance he said:</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394715-00030">“I know nothing of the matter.”</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394715-00031">Shiftily he turned his eyes away.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394715-00032">Now more heavy footfalls and the clash of weapons were heard behind the tapestry. One after another, the conspirators mounted the spiral staircase and formed a wall of armed men blocking Rizzio’s retreat. Escape this way being impossible, Mary tried to save her faithful servant by a parley. If David had committed any wrong, she said, “I promise to exhibit him before the lords of parliament, that he may be dealt with according to the usual forms of justice.” Meanwhile let Ruthven and the others withdraw from her apartment. Rebellion, however, does not know the meaning of obedience.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394715-00033">Ruthven had already advanced towards the trembling Rizzio; another of the conspirators threw a noose over the Italian’s shoulders and began to drag him away. Tumult ensued, during which the supper table was upset and the lights were extinguished. Rizzio, unarmed and a weakling, neither warrior nor hero, clung to the Queen’s robe, uttering cries of terror. He had caught Mary’s last word “justice” and screamed: “<i>Madonna, io sono morto, giustizia, giustizia!</i>”—My lady, I am dead, justice, justice! Another of the band pressed the muzzle of a loaded pistol against Mary’s side, and would, as the conspirators had intended, have shot her, had not another pulled back his arm, while Darnley himself intervened, holding his wife fast, partly (beyond question) to protect her, while the murderers hurried the shrieking and resisting Rizzio out of the supper room. As they dragged him through the bedroom, he clung to the bedclothes, still crying to the Queen for help, but the ruthless assassins clubbed his fingers to make him let go, and forced him on into the state apartment, where they flung themselves on him with their swords and daggers. Apparently they had intended only to arrest the Italian, and the next day to hang him in due form in the marketplace; but their excitement and blood lust carried them away. So madly and so carelessly did they stab him, that in their savagery they wounded one another. The floor became a pool of blood. Not until their victim had bled to death from fifty wounds did they desist from their brutality. Then the mutilated body of Mary Stuart’s most loyal friend was flung through the open casement into the courtyard below.
         </p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394715-00034">Crazed with grief, Mary listened to the death shrieks of her devoted servant. Ailing and pregnant as she was, she lacked strength to drag herself from Darnley’s grasp, but with all the energy of her passionate soul she revolted against the humiliation put upon her by these bandits in her own palace. Darn-ley could press her hand, but not her lips, and she railed at him wildly to show her contempt for the coward. She termed him traitor and son of a traitor; she blamed herself for having raised him from being a nonentity to sit upon a throne. What had, up to now, been nothing more than a wife’s dislike for her husband, hardened in this memorable hour to inextinguishable hatred. Vainly did Darnley try to excuse his conduct, reminding her that for some months she had refused to accept his embraces, and that she had long been accustomed to give more time to Rizzio than to himself, her lawful husband. Now Ruthven returned and, exhausted by what he had done, sank into a chair. Mary overwhelmed him with threats and invectives. As a wild beast in a cage will, when infuriated, fling itself against the bars, so did she rage against the pair of them. If Darnley had been able to read the meaning of her looks, he would have shrunk back in horror from the murderous hatred which flamed up against him. Had his mind been more alert, he would have realised the deadly menace of her saying that she no longer regarded herself as his wife, and would never rest “until he had a sorer heart than she had then”. Darnley, who was capable of only brief and petty passion, did not realise that she was unconsciously passing a death sentence upon him. When, worn out by what she had witnessed, she mutely allowed herself to be led to her room, he believed her energy to be broken, and that she would once more become his obedient wife. He was to learn, however, that hatred which knows how to be silent is more dangerous than open threats, and that one who offered a deadly affront to this woman summoned death to touch his own shoulder.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394715-00035">Rizzio’s screams, the clash of arms in the royal apartment, had aroused the palace. Sword in hand, those who were faithful to the Queen, Bothwell above all and Huntly, rushed out of their rooms. The conspirators, however, had guarded against every possibility. Holyrood was surrounded by armed men; the exits were barred, lest the town should send help to the Queen. Bothwell and Huntly, in order to fetch help and save the Queen’s life, had to jump out of the windows. Hearing from them what had happened and was like to happen, the provost of Edinburgh sounded the tocsin. Five hundred burgesses assembled round Holyrood, demanding sight of the Queen and to have speech with her. Instead, however, they were received by Darnley, who falsely declared that nothing serious had happened, only “that the Italian secretary is slain, because he has been detected in an intrigue with the Pope, the King of Spain and other foreign potentates, for the purpose of destroying the true evangile and introducing popery again into Scotland.” The good people had better go home to their beds. Naturally the provost did not venture to doubt a king’s word; the burgesses went home and Mary, who had vainly tried to get word with her subjects, was kept under guard in her apartment. The court ladies and the servants were debarred from entry; a triple guard was posted at the gates and doors of the palace. This night, for the first time in her life, the Queen of Scotland and the Isles became a prisoner. The conspiracy had been completely successful. In the courtyard lay the mangled corpse of her most trusty henchman; at the head of her enemies was her own husband; his were to be the royal rights, while she herself was not even allowed to leave her room. At one blow she had been dragged down from her high position, was powerless, forsaken, without friends or helpers, an object of scorn. In this dreadful night she seemed to have lost everything, but a strong heart is hardened beneath the hammer of destiny. Always when her liberty, her honour, her queenship, were at stake, Mary Stuart found more vitality within herself than in all her assistants or servitors.</p>
