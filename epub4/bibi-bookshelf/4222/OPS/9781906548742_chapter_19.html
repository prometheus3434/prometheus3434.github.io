Mary Stuart’s imprisonment was such a prolonged non-existence, such an empty, starless night. With the decision of the Westminster Conference, the rhythm of her life had been definitively interrupted. Year followed year, as at sea wave follows wave, sometimes more eventful, sometimes more tranquil; never again would she be stirred to the depths in her solitude, whether by unqualified happiness or by unqualified torment. A destiny which had been so moving and so passionate became uneventful, and therefore doubly unsatisfying. Thus in a sort of piaffing trot passed her twenty-eighth, twenty-ninth, thirtieth year. A new decade of her life opened, vacant and chill as the last had been at the close. Followed the thirty-first, the thirty-second, the thirty-third, the thirty-fourth, the thirty-fifth, the thirty-sixth, the thirty-seventh, the thirty-eighth, the thirty-ninth year. Merely to write the numbers is fatiguing. But to understand her cruel fate we have to dwell upon them, to understand the interminable duration of her spiritual agony; for each of these years had hundreds of days; each day had too many hours, and not one of these hours was irradiated by joy. Then came the fortieth year, and she was no longer a young woman, nor yet a strong one, but ageing, weary and out of health. Slowly there dragged themselves out the forty-first, the forty-second and the forty-third year, until at length death had compassion on her when her fellow mortals had none, and relieved her weary spirit from imprisonment.
         </p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394726-00001">There were many changes for her during these years, but only in minor and indifferent matters. Sometimes she was well, sometimes ill; sometimes she was hopeful and a hundred times she was disappointed; sometimes she was more harshly and at other times more clemently treated; occasionally Elizabeth would write her angry letters, to be followed by others that were kindly worded—but in general there was nothing but dull uniformity, a garland of colourless hours which slipped vacantly through her fingers. Outwardly her prison hours changed from time to time. Now she would be detained in Bolton Castle, now at Chatsworth or Sheffield or Tut-bury or Wakefield or Fotheringay. But only the names were different. They all had the same walls of impenetrable stone, and were really the same prison since they all deprived her of freedom. The monotonous procession of the days, the weeks and the months was marked by the circling of the sun, the moon and the stars. Night followed day and day followed night summing up the months and the years. Kingdoms passed and were renewed; kings rose and fell; women grew up, bore children and withered; beyond the coasts and the mountains the world continued in process of unceasing change. Only this one life was perpetually in the shadows, cut off from its roots, no longer bearing either blossom or fruit. Slowly, slowly, as if poisoned by impotent yearning, Mary Stuart watched the withering of her youth, the ticking-out of her life.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394726-00002">Paradoxically enough, the most cruel feature of this endless imprisonment was that, to outward seeming, it was never cruel. A self-reliant person can react against crude violence, can reply to humiliation by bitterness; always the mental stature can be increased by fierce resistance. Nothing but vacancy makes us absolutely impotent. Always the walls of a padded cell, against which the fists of the prisoner cannot even hurt themselves, are more unendurable than the hardest lock-up. No flogging, no abusive language, arouses so hopeless a frame of mind as the violation of freedom under the mask of obsequiousness and with devoted assurances of respect; no kind of scorn is more dreadful than that which assumes the form of politeness. This feigned consideration, not shown to the suffering human being, but to her rank, was the treatment to which Mary Stuart was unceasingly subjected. Always a respectful entourage of guardians, a masked watch, “honourable custody” by those who, hat in hand and with profound obeisances, followed hard upon her heels. Throughout these years never for a minute was Mary Stuart’s queenship forgotten. She was granted all kinds of valueless conveniences and petty freedoms, while the most important thing in life was withheld—true liberty.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394726-00003">Elizabeth, sedulous to maintain her prestige as a humane sovereign, was clever enough to avoid treating her adversary vengefully. She would take great care of her “good sister”! When Mary was out of health, anxious enquiries came from London; Elizabeth would offer the services of her own physician, would express a wish that the prisoner’s food should be prepared by her own domestic staff. No evil tongues should whisper that she was trying to rid herself of an inconvenient rival by poison. No one should complain that she was keeping an anointed queen in a prison cell. All that had happened was that she had urgently begged her Scottish sister to live in some of her fine English country mansions or castles as a permanent guest! Certainly it would have been much more convenient and safer for Elizabeth to keep the unyielding woman in the Tower of London, a much less costly plan than the one she adopted. But, having a wider experience of the world than her ministers of state, who again and again recommended her to take this precaution, Elizabeth persisted in avoiding the odium she would have incurred by sending Mary to the Tower. Her cousin should be treated as a queen, while entangled in a noose of reverence and fettered with golden chains.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394726-00004">Penurious though she was, Elizabeth was able, in this instance, to overcome her avarice, with a grudging heart providing for the maintenance of her uninvited guest no less than fifty-two pounds a week throughout these nineteen years. Since, in addition, Mary received a pension of twelve hundred pounds a year from France, she was well supplied with funds. She could live like a sovereign ruler at whichever castle or manor was her residence for the time. She was allowed to install a royal canopy in her reception room, keeping queenly state, though a prisoner. She had a silver table service; her rooms were lit with costly wax candles in silver sconces; the floors were covered with Turkey carpets—a rare luxury at that time. So abundantly were her apartments furnished, that dozens of wagons drawn by four-horse teams were needed when she was removed from one mansion to another. For her personal service she had a number of ladies-in-waiting, tire women and chambermaids. In the best days there were fifty of them to make up her personal staff. A miniature court with major-domos, priests, physicians, secretaries, paymasters, chamberlains, keepers-of-the-wardrobe, tailors, dressmakers and cooks—whose numbers the frugal Queen of England desperately endeavoured to cut down, while Mary Stuart with no less tenacity defended herself against any invasion of her privileges.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394726-00005">But that no cruelly romantic imprisonment was designed for the Queen who had fallen from power was shown at the outset by the choice of George Talbot, sixth Earl of Shrewsbury, a great nobleman and true gentleman, as her guardian in chief. Down to June 1569, when Elizabeth appointed him to this post, he might reckon himself a fortunate man. He had great possessions in the northern and midland counties, nine castles of his own, so that he had lived quietly on his estates as a minor prince in the by-paths of history, remote from offices and dignities. Untroubled by political ambition, this serious-minded man had been well satisfied with life. His beard was grizzled, and he must have thought that nothing was likely to disturb his rest until Elizabeth unexpectedly forced upon him the distasteful task of keeping watch and ward over her ambitious rival, who had been embittered by ill treatment.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394726-00006">His predecessor, Sir Francis Knollys, drew a breath of relief on being informed that Shrewsbury was to supersede him in the perilous charge, and declared: “As sure as there is a God in heaven, I would rather endure any punishment than continue this occupation.” For it was an unthankful task, this “honourable custody”, whose rights and limits were extremely vague, so that it was one which required immense tact. Mary was at one and the same time a queen and not a queen; in name she was a guest, but in fact she was a prisoner. Thus, as a gentleman, Shrewsbury had to play the part of a polite host, but as a jailer in Elizabeth’s confidence he had to restrict his “guest’s” liberties in various disagreeable ways. He was the controller of her doings, and yet could present himself before her only when making obeisance; he must be strict, but under the mask of subserviency; he must entertain her, and yet perpetually watch her. As if the situation were not already enough complicated, it was further involved by the fact that Lady Shrewsbury had been the notorious Bess of Hardwick. She had buried three husbands. Talbot was her fourth, and she reduced him to despair by her unceasing gossip. She was a weathercock, too, intriguing, now against Elizabeth, now in her behalf, sometimes favourable and sometimes antagonistic to Mary Stuart. Poor Shrewsbury had a difficult time of it among these three women, being the loyal subject of one, married to the second and bound to the third by invisible bonds. For fifteen years he was not really the imprisoned Queen’s guardian but her fellow prisoner and in his person once more was fulfilled the mysterious curse which made her bring misfortune to all whom she encountered upon her tragical path.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394726-00007">What did Mary Stuart do during these vacant and unmeaning years? She seemed to spend her time quietly and comfortably enough. Outwardly regarded, her daily round did not differ from that of other women of rank who lived year after year in a manor house or a castle. When she felt well enough, she would go out riding—hawking or hunting—surrounded by the inevitable “guard of honour”; or she would play pall-mall or some other outdoor game in order to keep herself, as far as possible, in good bodily condition. There was no lack of company. Visitors would come from neighbouring country mansions to pay their reverence to the interesting prisoner; for it must never be forgotten that, however powerless she might be at the moment, she was still the next heir to the English throne, and if anything untoward should happen to Elizabeth, Mary might reign in her stead. That was why far-seeing persons, Shrewsbury not excepted, thought it expedient to remain on good terms with her. Even Elizabeth’s favourite and intimate friends, Sir Christopher Hatton and the Earl of Leicester, wishing to keep a foot in both camps, would, behind their patroness’ back, send letters and greetings to her rival. Who could tell whether it might not be necessary, ere long, to bend the knee before her and to ask for some sinecure. In various ways, therefore, although kept in the wilds, Mary Stuart was continually in receipt of information as to what went on at the English court and in the wider world of Europe. Lady Shrews-bury told her a great deal about Elizabeth which this other Bess would have done better to keep to herself. Then, by various underground channels, news was continually flowing in from Rome. It must not be supposed that Mary Stuart’s exile was that of a prisoner in a dungeon. She was not completely forsaken. On the long winter evenings music could help to pass the time agreeably.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394726-00008">Not now, of course, as in the days of Chastelard, did young poets sing madrigals to her. Banished for ever were the masques of Holyrood, and this impatient heart had no room left any longer for love and passion. The inclination for such adventures was ebbing with her youth. Of her more enthusiastic adherents there only remained with her Willie Douglas, who had helped her to escape from Lochleven, and among all the men who formed her little court (no more Bothwells or Rizzios, alas!) she prized above the rest the physician. For she was often ill, suffering from rheumatism and from an inexplicable pain in the side. Often her legs were so greatly swelled that she could scarcely move, could get relief only in hot springs; while from the lack of exercise the body which had been so slender gradually became flaccid and obese. Seldom now was her will tensed as of old. Gone for ever were the long day’s gallops through the Scottish countryside, when she was journeying merrily from castle to castle.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394726-00009">The longer her seclusion lasted, the more did she take pleasure in domestic occupations. For hours she would sit, dressed in black like a nun, at her broidery frame, stitching with her lovely white hands those remarkable gold embroideries many of which have come down to us. At other times she would read her favourite books. There is no trustworthy record of her having had any love affairs during the nineteen years of her imprisonment—beyond the fugitive scheme for a marriage with the Duke of Norfolk. Since her tenderness could no longer flow out towards a Bothwell, or any other lover, it was directed more gently and with less exuberance to those creatures who never deceive us, domestic pets. Mary imported from France the gentlest and cleverest of all hounds, spaniels; she had an aviary and a dovecot; she personally cared for the flowers in the garden, and saw to it that the women of her suite should not suffer from want of anything; the ordinary cares of a housewife occupied her mind, now that she no longer felt the stirrings of passion. A casual observer, a passing guest who failed to look into the depths, might suppose that the ambition which had once shaken the world had died down in her, that all earthly desires had subsided. Frequently, in her flowing widow’s weeds, the ageing woman went to hear Mass said; she kneeled devoutly on the prie-dieu in her chapel; sometimes, though rarely now, she still wrote verses in her prayer book or upon a loose sheet of paper. No longer did she pen ardent sonnets, but poems breathing piety or resignation, in which she repudiated longing for any other kingdom than the kingdom of heaven, hoped to become reconciled with God and man and with her own fate!</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394726-00010">This, for instance:</p> 
         <div class="block extract" id="rw-block-extract_394726-00001">
            <p class="fp" id="rw-fp_394726-00002"><i>Que suis ie helas et quoy sert ma vie</i>
            </p> 
            <p class="fp" id="rw-fp_394726-00003"><i>len suis fors qun corps priue de coeur</i>
            </p>

            </p>
         </div> 
         <p class="fp" id="rw-p_394726-00011">(What am I, alas, and of what use my life? I am naught but a body without a heart, a vain shadow, a creature of misfortune, whose only future is one of living death.) Always she produced the impression of having abandoned thoughts of worldly power, of being one who quietly awaits the coming of that last grim visitor who can alone bring peace on earth.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394726-00012">Yet this was but semblance. In reality her pride was undiminished, and she had but one thought—that of recovering freedom and sovereignty. Not for a moment did she seriously desire to become reconciled with her lot. Work at the broidery frame, reading, conversation and reverie served only to conceal her real work, which was conspiracy. From the first to the last day of her imprisonment Mary was perpetually plotting, and wherever she went her habitation was a centre of intrigue. Work went on in her apartments feverishly by day and by night. Behind closed doors Mary, with the aid of her two secretaries, composed holograph diplomatic letters to the French and Spanish ambassadors, to the papal legate, to her adherents in Scotland and in the Netherlands. At the same time she sent imploring or tranquillising, humble or proud letters to Elizabeth, who had long ceased to answer them. In a hundred different disguises her messengers made their way to and from Paris and Madrid. Secret signs were agreed upon; ciphers were elaborated, and changed month by month; an overseas correspondence with the enemies of Elizabeth went on day after day. All the members of the little court—as Cecil knew perfectly well, and therefore was continually trying to have its numbers reduced—worked as a general staff aiming to promote her escape. Her fifty servants paid visit after visit to the neighbouring villages, to gather news, for the local population was bribed under cover of alms-giving, and was part of the gossamer organisation which kept Mary in touch with Madrid and Rome. Letters were smuggled in and out with the washing, in books, in hollow sticks, beneath the lids of ornamental boxes or in other ingenious hiding places. New tricks were continually being devised to elude Shrewsbury’s vigilance. For instance, the lining of a shoe would be opened up to hide between the layers a message written in invisible ink; or wigs were worn in which rolls of paper could be concealed. In the books which Mary Stuart received from Paris or from London, letters were underlined in accordance with a code, and important messages could thus be transmitted. The most compromising documents would be stitched beneath the inner sole of his shoe by the confessor. Mary Stuart, who in youth had learnt how to elaborate and to decipher cryptograms, directed the whole diplomatic service; and this exciting amusement of frustrating Elizabeth’s precautions kept her intelligence alert, replacing outdoor sports and other amusements. She flung herself with her usual heedlessness and ardour into this conspiratorial activity, with the result that often enough, when messages and pledges had come by some new route from Paris, from Rome or from Madrid, she could succeed in convincing herself that she was once more in possession of real power, could regard herself as a centre of European interest. The thought that Elizabeth knew her to be dangerous and yet could not bend her will, that despite the vigilance of those who kept watch over her she could conduct a campaign from her prison and modify the destinies of the world was, perhaps, the only pleasure which diverted and refreshed her mind during those long and vacant years.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394726-00013">Marvellous indeed was her energy, the vigour she continued to show though in chains; but it was tragical, likewise, through its futility. For Mary never had any luck in her undertakings. The conspiracies she was continually instigating were foredoomed to failure. The game was too unequal. The individual is always weak in face of an effective organisation. Mary Stuart was alone, whereas Elizabeth was the head of a great state, was in command of ministers, police, soldiers and spies; and besides, one can fight better from a government office than from a prison. Cecil had ample resources at his disposal; he could spend freely and, watching with a thousand eyes, could easily checkmate the attempts of this lonely and inexperienced woman. At that time the population of England was about three million. A large number, no doubt; but the authorities kept close watch on suspects; every foreigner who landed on the English coast was under strict observation; there were spies in the taverns, in the prisons, upon the ships that crossed the Channel. When these means failed to elicit the desired information, there was no hesitation in employing a stronger instrument—the rack.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394726-00014">The superiority of collective force over individual force was soon manifest. One after another of Mary’s self-sacrificing friends was, in the course of her years of imprisonment, dragged into the vaults of the Tower and tortured into avowing the schemes and the names of his confederates. One plot after another was crushed by this brutal method. Even when, now and again, Mary Stuart was able, by way of the embassies, to smuggle her correspondence abroad, it took weeks before her letters could reach Rome or Madrid; and many weeks more before her correspondents in the foreign capitals made up their minds to answer these dangerous dispatches; and many weeks more before the answer could get back to her. How supine then was the help which was offered; how intolerably lukewarm did it seem to the impatient woman who was always waiting for armies and armadas to be sent to set her free. The prisoner, the solitary, thinking day and night of his own sad fate, is always inclined to believe that those who live in the free and active world must be thinking as much about him as he thinks about himself. Of course, it is not so.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394726-00015">Vainly, therefore, did Mary Stuart continue to represent her liberation as the most important step towards the Counter-Reformation, as the first and most noteworthy thing the Catholic Church could do to safeguard its position. Those to whom she addressed these instigations were calculators and procrastinators, and were not agreed among themselves. The armada was not equipped; its main promoter, Philip II of Spain, prayed much, but ventured little. He was not inclined, on behalf of the imprisoned Scottish Queen, to declare a war whose outcome no one could foresee. Now and again he or the Pope would send money, to help her to bribe conspirators. But the plots were poor things, badly planned and promptly ferreted out by Walsingham’s spies! Only a few mutilated corpses on Tower Hill served, from time to time, to remind the populace that at some castle in the north there lived a royal prisoner who obstinately persisted in her claim to be the rightful Queen of England; to show the multitude that there were still fools and heroes ready to throw away their lives on behalf of this woman’s alleged rights.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394726-00016">It was plain to all intelligent persons that Mary’s incessant plotting would in the end drag her down to destruction; that she was leading a forlorn hope when, from her prison, she declared war against one of the mightiest monarchs of that day. As early as 1572, after the failure of the Ridolfi conspiracy, her brotherin-law Charles IX angrily declared: “The poor foolish woman will not desist until she loses her head. She will certainly bring about her own execution. If she does so, it will be her own fault, for I can do nothing to hinder her.” These were harsh words from a man whose own heroism sufficed only to make him, during the Massacre of St Bartholomew, fire upon unarmed fugitives from a safe window in the Louvre.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394726-00017">From the outlook of chill reason, Mary behaved foolishly in preferring the hopeless part of conspiracy to making a convenient but cowardly capitulation. It is probable that a timely renunciation of her royal pretensions would have unlocked the doors of her prison house, and if so, during all these years she had the key in her own hands. She need merely humble herself, solemnly abandon her claim alike to the Scottish and to the English throne, and England would have set her at liberty. England would have been glad to do so. Several times Elizabeth—not from magnanimity but from fear, because the accusing presence of this dangerous prisoner was a nightmare to her—endeavoured to build a golden bridge for Mary; again and again she was ready to negotiate with her “dear sister”, and offer an easy compromise. But Mary would rather remain a crowned prisoner than be a queen without a throne; and Knollys had rightly judged her when, during the first days of her imprisonment, he said of her that she had courage to hold out so long as there was left no more than a span of hope. She was keen-witted enough to understand that, if set free as a queen who had abdicated, she could enjoy nothing more than a pitiful freedom; that all that could then await her would be a shameful existence in some out-of-the-way corner; and that it was her present abasement which would give her a great position in history. Stronger than the bars of her prison house were the barriers imposed by her formal declaration that she would never abdicate, and that the last words she uttered on earth would be those of a Queen of Scotland.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394726-00018">Very narrow are the limits between folly and foolhardiness, for the most heroic actions can always be regarded as foolish. In concrete affairs Sancho Panza is shrewder than Don Quixote, and from the standpoint of a “reasonable” man Thersites is more reasonable than Achilles; but Hamlet’s words, “Rightly to be great is not to stir without great argument, but greatly to find quarrel in a straw when honour’s at the stake,” will remain the acid test of a heroic nature. Beyond question Mary Stuart’s resistance was almost hopeless against such overwhelming superiority of force; yet we should do wrong to call it absurd because it was in the end unsuccessful. Throughout these years, and more effectively as year followed year, this seemingly powerless and lonely woman, by her defiance, incorporated an immense power; and, for the very reason that she shook her chains, again and again she made England quake and Elizabeth’s heart tremble. We regard historical happenings in a false perspective when we look upon them only from the convenient standpoint of posterity, which sees effects as well as causes. When the hurly-burly’s done, when the battle’s lost or won, it is easy to stigmatise him who has been vanquished as a fool because he ventured a dangerous combat.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394726-00019">For nigh on twenty years the decision of the struggle between these two women hung in the balance. Many of the conspiracies instigated to restore Mary Stuart to the throne of Scotland or to establish her on that of England might, with better luck and more adroitness, have proved fatal to Elizabeth. Twice or thrice, the Tudor Queen escaped only by a hair’s breadth. First of all the Duke of Northumberland rebelled at the head of the Catholic nobles. The whole of the north was in an uproar, and Elizabeth found it hard work to remain mistress of the situation. Then, yet more dangerous, came the Duke of Norfolk’s intrigue. The flower of the English nobility, and among them some of Elizabeth’s closest friends, such as the Earl of Leicester, supported his scheme for marrying the Scottish Queen, who, lest he should be a laggard in love (what would she not do to promote her triumph?), wrote him the most affectionate letters. Through the intermediation of Ridolfi, the Florentine, Spanish and French troops were ready to land on English soil. Had not Norfolk (as shown by his before-mentioned repudiation of his marital scheme) been a weakling and a coward, had not chance, wind and storm, the sea and betrayal, wrought against the enterprise, the page would have been turned, roles exchanged. Mary Stuart would have gone to live at Westminster while Elizabeth Tudor would have languished in the Tower or have been in her coffin.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394726-00020">The execution of Norfolk, the fate of Northumberland and of all the others who, during these years, had laid down their lives for Mary’s sake, did not deter her last suitor. Another wooer appeared upon the scene, Don John of Austria, illegitimate son of Charles V and half-brother of Philip II, the victor of Lepanto, exemplar of chivalry, the first warrior of Christendom. Excluded from the Spanish succession by his bastardy, he had attempted to found a kingdom for himself in Tunis. Then there offered a chance of mounting the Scottish throne by a marriage to the imprisoned Queen. His army was being equipped in the Netherlands, and a plan had been made for the deliverance of Mary when Don John was struck down by the fate that awaited all her helpers. He died prematurely …</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394726-00021">It was luck that failed, rather than cunning. If we look clearly into the matter of this prolonged struggle between Elizabeth and Mary, luck always favoured the former, whereas disaster invariably dogged the latter’s courses. Force against force, personality against personality, the women were fairly matched. Not so their respective stars. Once luck had definitely turned against Mary, once she had been dethroned and imprisoned, all her attempts miscarried. The fleets sent against England were scattered by storms; her messengers lost their way; her suitors died or were slain; her friends lacked vigour in the decisive hour; and whoever tried to help her was working for his own destruction.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394726-00022">Profoundly moving, therefore, was what Norfolk said upon the scaffold: “Nothing that was begun by her or for her has ever turned out well.” Evil had pursued her from the time when Bothwell had become her lover. It was equally fatal to love her or to be loved by her. Whoever wished her well did her harm; whoever served her invited death to tap him on the shoulder. As the loadstone mountain in the Arabian tale attracted ships to their wreck because of the iron they had on board, so did she tend to involve all who came near her in her own unhappy fate. That is why her name has become invested with the sinister magic of death. The more hopeless her cause, the more fiercely did she fight. Her long and melancholy imprisonment, instead of breaking her pride, stiffened her to renewed defiance. Of her own free will, though aware that what she did was futile, she challenged the final award of destiny.</p>
