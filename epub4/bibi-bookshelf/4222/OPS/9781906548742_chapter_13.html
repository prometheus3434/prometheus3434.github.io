         <p class="fp" id="rw-fp_394720-00001"><span class="dropcap">P</span><span class="sc">ASSION CAN WORK WONDERS</span>. It can awaken superhuman energy. By its irresistible pressure it can evoke titanic forces from a previously tranquil soul and can drive a hitherto well-regulated and law-abiding person to crime. The nature of passion is, however, such that, after intense ebullitions and wild outbreaks, a phase of exhaustion ensues. That is what distinguishes one who becomes a criminal through passion from a born, or a habitual criminal. The casual and passionate criminal is, as a rule, only equal to the occasion as regards the commission of the crime, but proves unable to deal with its consequences. Acting under stress of impulse, with his mind concentrated on the deed that is to be done, his energies are tensed upon this one and only aim. Thereafter, as soon as the deed is done, his impetus fails, his resolution subsides, at the very time when a cool and calculating criminal devotes himself to a purposive struggle against the representatives of law and morality. The energies of the habitual criminal are held in store for dealing with what will come after the crime.
         </p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394720-00001">Mary Stuart (and we think the better of her for this) was unfitted to cope with the situation into which her thraldom to Both-well had brought her. Though she was a criminal, she had only become one through irresponsible passion, under the promptings of another will than her own. She had lacked the strength to forbid her husband’s murder, and after it she was in a state of collapse. Two possibilities were open to her. She might break off all relations with Bothwell, who had done more than, at the bottom of her soul, she had desired. Or, on the other hand, she might help to conceal the crime, feigning sorrow in order to avert suspicion from him and from herself. Instead, Mary did the stupidest thing anyone in so suspicious a situation could possibly do. She did nothing. She betrayed herself through dull inaction. Like a mechanical toy, having been wound up by the influence of a stronger nature than her own, she had, as if in a trance, automatically done whatever Bothwell wanted. She had gone to Glasgow, beguiled Darnley, brought him back with her to Kirk o’ Field. Now the clockwork mechanism had run down, and she made no further move. At the very time when skilful play-acting was needed to convince the world of her own and her lover’s innocence, she dropped the mask. As if petrified, she displayed a horrible rigidity and nonchalance which could not fail to concentrate suspicion upon her.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394720-00002">Such spiritual numbness, such passivity and indifference, at the very time when active misrepresentation, vigorous defensive, and extreme presence of mind are essential, are by no means uncommon. Inertia of this sort is a reaction from excess of tension, the outcome of a revenge taken by nature on those who have unreasonably overtaxed their forces. On the evening after Waterloo, Napoleon’s demonic energy of will was in abeyance. He was mute and passive, could give no instructions to anyone, although in that hour of catastrophe it was essential for him to take active measures to avert the crowning disaster. Strength seemed to have run out of him as wine runs out of a barrel when the spigot has been removed. In like manner, Oscar Wilde collapsed in the hours before his arrest. Friends had warned him; there was still time for him to escape; he had funds, could have taken train to Dover and crossed the Channel. But, frozen stiff, he sat in his room waiting and waiting—as if for a miracle or for annihilation. Only by such analogies, which could be multiplied a thousandfold by students of history and biography, can we explain Mary Stuart’s foolish passivity, which concentrated suspicion upon her during the weeks following her husband’s murder. Before the murder, no one had suspected her intimacy with Bothwell, and her visit to Darnley at Glasgow might easily have been supposed to be the outcome of a desire for reconciliation. After the crime, however, the widow became the centre of interest. It was incumbent upon her to make her innocence plain by brilliant misrepresentation. Yet the unhappy woman would appear to have been seized with loathing at the thought of such hypocrisy. Instead of doing her best to avert natural suspicion, she made herself seem more culpable than she actually was by manifesting the most callous indifference to her husband’s death. Like a woman who has determined to drown herself, she closed her eyes while flinging herself into the water, that she might see nothing more, feel nothing more, hoping only for the oblivion of non-existence. Criminology can hardly find a more signal example of the person who has become a criminal through passion, and in whom, after the crime, complete paralysis ensues. <i>Quos deus perdere vult</i> … Whom the gods would destroy, they first make mad.
         </p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394720-00003">What would an innocent, an honest, a loving woman, be she queen or commoner, do when, at dead of night, tidings are brought that her husband has been murdered by unknown miscreants? Would she not rage and storm? Would she not scream for the immediate arrest of the guilty? If a queen, she would instantly cast into prison those upon whom a glimmer of suspicion rested. She would appeal to her subjects to help her; she would ask neighbouring sovereigns to seize any that attempted to cross her frontiers. As in France, when her boy-husband Francis II had died, she would have gone into seclusion, showing no inclination for social amusements until weeks, months or years had elapsed and, above all, never resting until every participant in the crime had been brought to justice.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394720-00004">Such would have been the behaviour, in these circumstances, of an affectionate widow, innocent of her husband’s murder. Logically, therefore, such also should have been the behaviour of a guilty widow. From calculation she would have played the innocent, for what can safeguard a criminal better than to act as if he had neither part nor lot in the crime? Instead, after Darnley’s murder, Mary Stuart displayed a callousness that could not fail to arouse dark suspicions in the minds even of her well-wishers. She showed neither the gloomy wrath she had shown after the assassination of Rizzio, nor yet the seemly melancholy prescribed for her by French court etiquette after the premature death of Francis II. She had penned a touching elegy on Francis, but she did not consecrate her poetic talent to enshrining the memory of Darnley. Instead, during the first hours after the crime, she calmly signed lengthy and confused dispatches to the courts of Europe—an account of the murder so worded as to avert suspicion from herself. In this remarkable tale the facts were so distorted as to imply that the crime had not been primarily directed against the King but against herself. According to the official version of the story, the conspirators had intended the nocturnal explosion at Kirk o’ Field to destroy both the wedded pair, and nothing but the chance that she had left the house in order to participate in the wedding festival at Holy-rood had saved the Queen from perishing with the King. Her hand did not tremble as she signed the following statement: “The matter is horrible and strange, as we believe the like was never heard in any country … By whom it was done, or in what manner, appears not yet. We doubt not but, according to the diligence which our Council has begun already to use, the certainty of all shall be known shortly and the same discovered, which we wot God will never suffer to lie hid; we hope to punish the same with such rigour as shall serve as an example … for all ages to come.”</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394720-00005">This distortion of the facts was, of course, too great to mislead public opinion. For in reality, as all Edinburgh knew, the Queen had left Kirk o’ Field at eleven pm, attended by a great train and numerous torch-bearers, while Darnley remained in the lonely house. Everyone in the capital was aware that she was not spending the night with her husband, and therefore the murderers, hiding in the darkness, could not possibly have had any designs upon her life when, three hours later, they blew up the house. Besides, the explosion was nothing more than a smokescreen, intended to hide the fact that Darnley was strangled or smothered (probably before the explosion). Thus the stupidity of the official account served only to intensify the conviction of Mary’s complicity.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394720-00006">Strangely enough, little hubbub was raised about the matter in Scotland, and the indifference of her subjects, as well as Mary’s own, served during these days to intensify the animus of the foreign world. For this much is true in the above-mentioned report, that the affair was horrible and strange, so that the like had never been recorded in the bloodstained annals of history. The King of Scotland had been murdered in his own capital; his house had been blown up. What happened? Did the town quiver with excitement and indignation? Did the Scottish lords hurry from their castles to Edinburgh in order to defend the Queen, who was also declared to have been endangered by the plot? Did priests denounce the crime from their pulpits? Did the law courts do their utmost to discover and condemn the criminals? Were the gates of the city closed? Were hundreds of suspects arrested and racked? Was the border guarded? Were the ports watched? Was the corpse of the slain King carried through the streets, attended by a mournful procession of the nobles of the land? Was a catafalque erected in one of the public squares, surrounded by guards and torchbearers, so that the deceased King could lie in state? Was parliament summoned, to be informed about the crime and to take the necessary steps to avenge it? Did the Scottish lords, the defenders of the throne, solemnly swear to punish the assassins?</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394720-00007">Nothing of the kind happened. Nothing happened. An incomprehensible silence followed the thunderclap. The Queen secluded herself in her apartment instead of making a public utterance. The Scottish lords were silent. Neither Moray nor Lethington raised a finger, not one of those who had bowed the knee before their King. They neither blamed the deed nor extolled it. With dour quietude they waited upon events. It was plain that open discussion of the King’s murder would be inconvenient, since nearly all of them had been accessories before the fact. The burghers, in their turn, stayed quietly at home, not venturing to do more than mutter their suspicions. They knew it was inexpedient for such as they to meddle in the affairs of the great.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394720-00008">To begin with, therefore, what happened was precisely what the assassins had hoped. No one seemed to look upon the murder as anything more than a petty and undesirable incident. Perhaps there has been no other occasion in European history when a court, a nobility, the population of a capital, has made so little stir about the killing of a king. Even the most obvious and simple measures for the elucidation of the crime were conspicuously neglected. There was no official or legal inquiry at the site of the murder. No report was called for. No proclamation was issued. Everything, as if designedly, was left shrouded in darkness. No post-mortem examination was made by such experts as then existed. Even today we do not know whether Darnley was strangled, smothered, stabbed or poisoned before the house was blown up in order to hide the traces of the crime. This much only is certain, that his corpse, with a blackened face, was found at some distance from the house. By Bothwell’s orders, the body was interred with unseemly haste, lest too many people should have a chance of examining it. Let the earth quickly cover the remains of Henry Darnley. Let the dark affair be speedily shuffled out of sight, before it stank to heaven.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394720-00009">The world became convinced, therefore, that persons of high standing must have been responsible for the murder. Such was the reason why Henry Darnley, King of Scotland, had not been vouchsafed a burial worthy of a king. Not with pomp and circumstance was the coffin borne through the streets of the city, followed by a mournful widow, by earls and other persons of rank and station. No royal salutes were fired nor were the bells tolled in the church towers. Secretly, and by night, the entombment in the chapel took place. Dishonourably and hastily was the body of Henry Darnley, King of Scotland, lowered into the grave, as if he himself had been a murderer, instead of the victim of hate and greed. Read one Mass over him, and that will suffice! His tormented soul will no longer disturb the peace of Scotland! … <i>Quos deus perdere vult</i> …
         </p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394720-00010">Mary Stuart, Bothwell, and the other Scottish lords hoped that, with the nailing-on of the coffin lid, the whole matter would be hushed up. Lest, however, inquisitive folk should make trouble, lest Queen Elizabeth should complain that nothing had been done to throw light upon the crime, it was decided to show a semblance of activity. To obviate a serious inquiry, Bothwell commanded a spurious one. A bogus search was to be made for the “unknown assassins”. True, the whole city knew their names. Too many confederates had been needed to surround the house, to buy large quantities of gunpowder and to store it in sacks at the site of the explosion for them to pass unobserved. The sentries at the gates knew only too well who had made their way back into Edinburgh that night after the explosion. Since, however, the Queen’s council was now practically reduced to Bothwell and Lethington, the prime actor and the chief confederate, who needed only to look in the mirror to see the guilty parties, the council sedulously maintained the pretence that the crime had been the work of “unknown miscreants”, and issued a proclamation offering a reward of two thousand pounds Scots to anyone who would put the authorities upon the track of the guilty. Two thousand pounds Scots, equivalent to one hundred and sixty five English pounds, was a respectable sum in those days, and a fortune for any poor citizen of Edinburgh, but everyone knew that if he should blab he would be more likely to have a dirk between his ribs than the two thousand pounds in his pouch. Bothwell established a military dictatorship. His retainers, the borderers, masterfully patrolled the streets, armed to the teeth, a plain menace to whosoever might think of trying to earn the reward by indiscreet revelations.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394720-00011">When attempts are made to repress truth by force, it seeks an outlet by cunning. What could not be said in the open and by day could be posted on the walls during the night. The morning after the issue of the proclamation, placards were pasted up in the marketplace and even on the gates of the royal palace at Holyrood. These placards denounced as the murderers Bothwell, his accomplice Sir James Balfour, together with the Queen’s servants Bastien and Joseph Rizzio. Other names were mentioned in other lists. Two names, however, were found in them all, Bothwell and Balfour, Balfour and Bothwell.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394720-00012">Had she not been, as it were, under a spell, had not her reason been completely overmastered by passion, had not her will been in thrall, there is one thing which Mary Stuart would certainly have now decided upon, when the popular voice was speaking so plainly; she would have broken off all connection with Bothwell. Had even a gleam of reasonableness persisted in her darkened mind, she would have had nothing more to do with him. At any rate she would have avoided converse with him until, by some clever scheming, she had secured “official” proof of his innocence. Meanwhile, under one pretext or another, she would have dismissed him from the court. The one thing which she should have avoided was allowing this man, whom current talk declared to have been the murderer of her husband the King of Scotland, to continue to hold sway in the late King’s house. Above all, since public opinion unanimously regarded him as the chief of the assassins, she should have avoided making him chief of the inquiry which ostensibly aimed at the discovery of the “unknown miscreants”.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394720-00013">But this was not the limit of her folly. On the illicit proclamations, besides Bothwell and Balfour, her two servants Bastien and Joseph Rizzio had been denounced as confederates. What, then, should Mary have instantly done? Common sense demanded that she should hand over this pair of understrappers to the court for trial. Instead of doing so, committing a blunder which was tantamount to self-incrimination, she privately dismissed the two men from her service. They were furnished with passports and hastily smuggled across the border. It was the very opposite of what she should have done to safeguard her own honour. Even crazier was her conduct in another respect. Prudence demanded that she should mourn more conspicuously for her assassinated spouse than she had mourned for Francis II. Instead, after a bare week in retreat, she left Holyrood to visit Lord Seton in his castle. She could not even bring herself to make the requisite gesture of court mourning, and as if to flaunt her folly in the face of the world, she received as visitor at Seton House—whom? James Bothwell, the man whose portrait was being hawked in the streets of Edinburgh with the legend: “This is the King’s murderer.”</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394720-00014">But Scotland is not the world. Although the conscience-stricken lords and the intimidated burgesses held their peace, making as if, with the King’s interment, all interest in his murder had come to an end—at the courts of London, Paris and Madrid the dreadful deed was by no means regarded with the same equanimity. For Scotland, Darnley had been nothing more than a tiresome foreigner, of whom the world could be rid in the usual way as soon as he became too much of a nuisance. For the courts of Europe, Darnley was a crowned and anointed King, scion of an illustrious family, a man of the highest rank; his cause was theirs. It need hardly be said that no one believed the official report for a moment. From the first, throughout Europe, it was universally held that Bothwell had been the murderer-in-chief and that Mary had been his confidante. Even the Pope and the papal legate denounced the unhappy woman in the strongest terms. But what chiefly disturbed the minds of foreign princes was not so much the murder itself. The sixteenth century was not greatly troubled about moral questions, or likely to be squeamish about a bagatelle such as a political assassination. It was but a couple of generations since Machiavelli had published <i>The Prince</i>, and ever since (as indeed before!) murder for “reasons of state” had been regarded as a trifling matter, or at most a venial sin. There was scarcely a royal house in Europe without some such skeleton in its cupboard. Henry VIII had made no bones about the execution of wives he wanted to get rid of. Philip II would not have liked to be pressed with questions about the murder of his son Don Carlos. The Borgias (Pope Alexander III and his son Cesare) have an evil reputation as poisoners. Still, there is a distinction to be drawn. The aforesaid princes did their dark deeds by proxy, and liked to keep their own hands “clean”. What her fellow sovereigns expected from Mary Stuart was a strenuous and personable attempt at self-exculpation, and what they took amiss was her ostentatious indifference. Coldly at first, and then with rising indignation, they watched their imprudent sister, who did nothing to avert suspicion, who refrained from having a few commoners hanged and quartered, who went on amusing herself by playing pall-mall and had as her chosen companion the man who was unquestionably the chief instigator of the murder. With honest anger Mary’s trusty ambassador in Paris reported that her impassivity was making a very bad impression. “You yourself have become the object of calumny here, being regarded as having planned and commanded this crime.” With a frankness which will for ever redound to the credit of this churchman, he told the Queen that, unless she atoned for the murder in the most explicit and uncompromising manner, it would be better for her to have lost her life and her all.
         </p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394720-00015">Here were plain words from a friend. Had there been a spark of reason left in her mind, had she still possessed any will of her own, this exhortation would have stirred her. Queen Elizabeth’s letters of condolence convey an even plainer message. For, by a remarkable coincidence, no one in the world was better fitted to understand Mary Stuart in this terrible crisis than the woman who, throughout life, was her harshest adversary. Elizabeth, contemplating Mary’s crime, seemed to be watching herself in a mirror; for Mary was in the same situation, exposed to universal and probably justified suspicion, as Elizabeth herself had been in the days of her most ardent passion for Robert Dudley. Just as in Mary’s case an unwanted husband, so in Elizabeth’s case an inconvenient wife, had to be swept out of the path to clear the way to a fresh marriage. With or without Elizabeth’s knowledge (the mystery of that matter will never be solved), murder had been committed when, one morning, Amy Robsart, Robert Dudley’s wife, had been slain by “unknown miscreants”. As, now, all glances were suspiciously directed at Mary Stuart, so, then, they had been directed at Elizabeth Tudor. Why, Mary Stuart herself, at that time still Queen of France, had made mock of the cousin who, wishing to marry her Master of the Horse, had connived at his making an end of his own wife. With the same confidence as now the world regarded Bothwell as the murderer, so then it had regarded Dudley as a murderer and the Queen of England as his confederate. Thus the memory of her own former troubles made Elizabeth the best, the most trusty adviser, of her sister in misfortune. With much shrewdness and force of character, Elizabeth had saved her honour by promptly commanding an inquiry—fruitless, of course, but nevertheless an inquiry. In the end she had stilled gossip and scandal by renouncing her dearest wish, that of marrying the gravely compromised Leicester. This renunciation made the world believe that the Queen of England could have had no part in the murder. Elizabeth wanted a like renunciation on the part of the Queen of Scotland.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394720-00016">Elizabeth’s letter under the date of 24th February 1567 is further remarkable in its sincerity as a missive from one human being to another. It really has the human touch. “Madam,” she writes, in genuine concern,</p> 
         <div class="block extract" id="rw-block-extract_394720-00001">
            <p id="rw-p_394720-00017"><i>my ears have been so much shocked, by my distress, and my heart appalled, at hearing the horrible report of the abominable murder of your husband, my slaughtered cousin, that I have scarcely as yet spirit to write about it—but although nature constrains me to lament his death, so near to me in blood as he was, I must tell you boldly that I am far more concerned for you than I am for him. Oh, madam! I should neither perform the office of a faithful nor that of an affectionate friend, if I studied rather to please your ears than to preserve your honour—therefore I will not conceal from you that people, for the most part, say “that you will look through your fingers at this deed, instead of revenging it”, and that you have not cared to touch those who have done you this pleasure, as if the deed had not been without the murderers having had that assurance. I implore you to believe me that I myself would not for all the gold in the world cherish such a thought in my heart. I would never allow so evil a guest to harbour in my heart by having so bad an opinion of any sovereign, and still less of one to whom I wish as much good as my heart can conceive or as you yourself could desire. Therefore I exhort you, counsel you and implore you to take this affair so much to heart that you will not be afraid to wreak vengeance even on him who stands nearest to you, should he be guilty; and that no consideration whatever will withhold you from giving the world a proof that you are as noble a ruler as you are a righteous woman.</i>
            </p>
         </div> 
         <p class="fp" id="rw-fp_394720-00002">Elizabeth, apt to be so double-faced, probably never wrote a more sincere or kindly epistle than this. To Queen Mary, despite her numbed senses, it must have come like a pistol shot, and at length awakened her to realities. Here was another accusing finger directed against Bothwell. Again she was assured that any consideration for him would be taken as evidence of complicity in her husband’s murder. But, let me reiterate, Mary Stuart’s condition during these weeks was one of complete enslavement. She was so “shamefully enamoured”, wrote one of Elizabeth’s spies in his report to London, “that she had been heard to say she would go with him to the world’s end in a white petticoat, leaving all rather than forsake him.” Appeals were uttered to deaf ears; reason could make no headway against the stir in her blood. Because she had forgotten herself, she believed that the world would forget her and her crime.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394720-00018">For a while, throughout the month of March 1567, Mary might well believe that her passivity was having the right effect. Scotland was silent, the legal authorities were blind and deaf, and Bothwell (strangely enough!) with the best will in the world, was unable to lay his hands upon the “unknown miscreants”—although the name of the murderer-in-chief was being whispered in every house. All knew who was the guilty man, but all were afraid to claim the promised reward and utter the dreaded name out loud. At length a voice was raised in denunciation. The murdered King’s father, the Earl of Lennox, was in high repute among the Scottish nobles, and the authorities had to pay heed to him when he complained that weeks had elapsed without bringing the murderers of his son to justice. Mary Stuart, since the leader of the assassins was her paramour, and since Lethington, who had been a confederate, guided her with his counsels, gave an evasive answer, saying that she would do her best and would bring the affair before parliament. But Lennox knew that these words meant nothing, and reiterated his demands. It was essential, he said, to arrest forthwith those whose names had been anonymously placarded in Edinburgh.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394720-00019">So specific a demand was not easy to elude. Again, however, Mary shuffled. She would be glad to do what Lennox asked, but so many names had been placarded, most of them of persons who obviously had nothing to do with the murder. Let her father-in-law himself declare the names of those whom he regarded as guilty. She hoped, doubtless, that fear of Bothwell, the dictator, would prevent Lennox from mentioning the latter’s name. Meanwhile, however, Lennox took steps to secure his own safety and to strengthen his position. He got into touch with Elizabeth and placed himself under her protection. Meticulously, therefore, he named the persons against whom he demanded an investigation. First came Both-well, then Balfour, then David Chalmers and some of Mary Stuart’s and Bothwell’s serving men, who had long since been spirited across the border lest their tongues should be loosened by the rack. Now, to her consternation, Mary began to realise that the comedy of “looking through her fingers” had come to an end. Lennox’s persistence, she felt, must be backed up by the energy and authority of Queen Elizabeth. By this time too Catherine de’ Medici had plainly intimated that she regarded Mary Stuart as “dishonoured”, and that Scotland need expect no friendship from France so long as the murder had not been properly investigated in the law courts. There was a swift change of scene, replacing the contention that inquiry was “futile” by another comedy, that of a public legal inquiry. Mary was compelled to agree that Bothwell (small folk would be dealt with later) should defend himself before a court of his peers. On 28th March 1567, a summons was sent to the Earl of Lennox, commanding him to appear in Edinburgh on 12th April and formulate his charges against Bothwell.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394720-00020">Bothwell was by no means the man to present himself in a penitent’s robe and humbly bow before his judges. If he was ready for a trial by his peers, it was only because he was determined that there should be a “cleansing”—not a sentence, but an acquittal. He made his preparations with his customary energy. First of all he induced the Queen to put him in command of all the fortresses in Scotland, thus gaining control of the available weapons and ammunition throughout the country. He knew that might was right, so he summoned his borderers to Edinburgh and equipped them as if for battle. Shamelessly, with the audacity and lawlessness characteristic of the man, he established a reign of terror in Edinburgh. He publicly announced that, if he could discover by whom the “treasonable painted tickets” were designed and posted, he would wash his hands in their blood—this threat being intended as a warning to Lennox. He swaggered about with his hand on his sword hilt, while his followers had their dirks ready, openly declaring that they had no mind to allow the lord of their clan to be arrested as a criminal. Let Lennox dare to come and accuse him! Let the judges try to condemn the dictator of Scotland!</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394720-00021">Such preparations were too unambiguous to leave a doubt in Lennox’s mind as to what awaited him. He might go to Edinburgh to accuse Bothwell, but there was little chance that Bothwell would allow him to leave the city alive. Once more he turned to his patroness Elizabeth, who thereupon sent an urgent letter to Mary warning her for the last time that any open breach of the peace would expose her to suspicion of complicity.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394720-00022">“Madam,” wrote the English Queen to the Scottish,</p> 
         <div class="block extract" id="rw-block-extract_394720-00002">
            <p id="rw-p_394720-00023"><i>I should not be so unfeeling as to trouble you with this letter were it not that we are commanded to love the afflicted and that the cry of the unfortunate impels me. I learn, madam, that you have issued a proclamation to the effect that the judicial proceedings against those suspected of participation in the murder of your late husband and my deceased cousin will take place on the twelfth of the present month. It is of extreme importance that matters should not be obscured, as they very well might be, by secrecy or cunning. The father and the friends of the deceased have humbly begged me to ask you to postpone the inquiry, because they have noticed that these scoundrelly persons are trying to achieve by force what they cannot achieve by law. In my love for you, therefore, I cannot act otherwise than I now do, since you are the person most concerned, and I wish to tranquillise those who are innocent of so unspeakable a crime. Were you yourself not guiltless, this would be reason enough to rob you of your dignity as a princess and to expose you to the contempt of the multitude. Rather than such a thing should happen to you, I should wish for you an honourable tomb instead of a dishonourable life.</i>

         <p class="fp" id="rw-p_394720-00024">This new appeal to Mary’s conscience could not fail to arouse her benumbed senses. We cannot be certain, however, that the exhortation reached the Queen of Scotland in time. Bothwell was on guard, fearing neither death nor the devil, and least of all the English Queen. The special messenger to whom the letter had been entrusted for delivery was detained at the gates of the palace by Bothwell’s underlings. He was told that the Queen was asleep and could not receive him.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394720-00025">The special messenger, bearing a missive from one queen to another, wandered disconsolately about the streets. At length he obtained audience of Bothwell, who impudently opened the letter directed to Mary Stuart, read it, and thrust it into his pocket. We do not know whether he ever showed it to Mary, nor is the matter of importance. She was his bondslave, who dared to do nothing opposed to his will. It is even recorded that she was foolish enough to wave her hand to him from the window when, surrounded by his riders, he set forth to the Tolbooth. Thus she wished success to the notorious murderer on his way to participate in the comedy of justice.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394720-00026">Even if Mary Stuart never received Elizabeth’s last warning, she was none the less warned. Three days before, her half-brother Moray took leave of her. He was, he told her, seized with a desire to travel through France to Italy, for he wanted “to see Venice and Milan.” Mary had had ample experience to show her that the sudden disappearance of Moray from the political theatre foreboded stormy weather, and that his determination to be absent from the comedy of justice was intended to signify disapproval. On this occasion, indeed, Moray was plain-spoken enough, and did not conceal the true reason for his journey. He told everyone who cared to listen to him that he had tried to arrest Sir James Balfour as one of the chief participants in the murder, and that Bothwell, wishing to protect a confederate, had prevented his doing so. A week later, in London, he candidly informed the Spanish ambassador de Silva that he felt it would be dishonourable to stay any longer in the Scottish kingdom while so strange and terrible a crime remained unpunished. We may assume then that James spoke candidly to his sister before taking leave. We know for a fact that Mary was in tears when he quitted her apartment. But she could not restrain him from going. Her energy had departed since she had become Bothwell’s slave. She could only let things take the course prescribed by a stronger will than hers. The Queen in her was subjugated, and she was nothing but an amorous woman.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394720-00027">On 12th April the comedy of justice, which began challengingly, ended in like manner. Bothwell rode to the Tolbooth, sword strapped to his side, dagger in his belt, surrounded by a train of armed followers, in the spirit of a warrior setting forth to storm a fortress. The number of the clansmen has perhaps been exaggerated, but according to current reports it was four thousand. Lennox, on the strength of an ancient edict, had been forbidden to bring more than six men with him if he entered the city. Lennox felt in no mind to face “justice” thus backed by overwhelming force. He knew that Elizabeth’s letter asking for a postponement of the proceedings had been sent to Mary, and that moral force was on his side. He was content, therefore, to send one of his feudatories to the Tolbooth, to read a written protest. The chief accuser being absent, the judges, some of whom had been intimidated, and others bribed by lands or money or titles, found it convenient to avoid exhaustive inquiry. They were freed from a burden. After deliberating among themselves upon a matter which had been decided beforehand, they unanimously exonerated Bothwell from “any art and part of the said slauchter of the King” on the ground that “no accusation had been brought against him”. This exculpation might have seemed insufficient to a man of honour, but Bothwell held it as a triumph. Harness clinking, he rode through the city, brandishing his drawn sword, and publicly challenging to a duel anyone who might venture to declare him guilty or in part guilty of the late King’s murder.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394720-00028">The burgesses, however, murmured among themselves that the law had been brought into contempt. Mary’s friends looked askance, with “sore hearts”. “It was pitiful,” writes Melville, her most loyal friend, “to watch this excellent princess hastening to destruction without anyone calling her attention to the danger she was running.” But Mary refused to listen and would accept no warning. A morbid delight in preposterous hazards drove her further and further. Circumspection became impossible to her; she would not ask and would not hearken, but could only rush to her doom, the slave of her feelings. The day after Bothwell flaunted his freedom in the streets of Edinburgh, she inflicted a humiliation on the whole country by conferring upon this notorious criminal the highest honour Scotland could offer. At the opening of parliament Bothwell bore the insignia of the nation, the crown and the sceptre. Who could doubt that this man who now carried the crown in his hands would tomorrow be wearing it? Bothwell, indeed, was not a man to hide his light under a bushel, and his boldness was one of his least unamiable characteristics. Impudently, energetically and frankly, he demanded his reward. Without shame, “for his great and manifold gud service”, he asked for the gift of the strongest castle in the country, Dunbar. Then, since the Scottish lords complied with his will, he determined to force from them their consent to his marriage with Mary Stuart. On the evening when the sittings of parliament closed, as dictator he invited the whole company of them to supper in Ainslie’s Taverne. The wine flowed freely, and when most of those present were already half-seas-over (we recall the famous scene in <i>Wallenstein</i>), he laid before the lords a bond which not only made them pledge themselves to defend him against every calumniator but also to approve him, “noble puissant lord”, as a worthy husband for the Queen. The bond ran as follows:
         </p> 
         <div class="block extract" id="rw-block-extract_394720-00003">
            <p id="rw-p_394720-00029"><i>That James Earl of Bothwell, Lord of Hailes, Crichton and Liddesdale, Great Admiral of Scotland and Lieutenant of all the Marches, being calumniated by malicious report and divers placards, privily affixed on the Kirk of Edinburgh and other places, by evil-willers and privy enemies, as art and part in the heinous murder of the King, late husband to the Queen’s Majesty, and also by special letters sent to her Highness by the Earl of Lennox accused of the said crime, had submitted to an assize, and been found innocent of the same by certain noblemen his peers, and other barons of good reputation; the undersigned united to defend and bear him harmless against his privy or public calumniators bypast or to come.</i>

         <p class="fp" id="rw-p_394720-00030">The signatories to this instrument, including eight earls, among whom were the Earls of Morton, Huntly and Argyll (Justice General), Glencairn, Cassilis and Rothes, together with eleven barons, peers of parliament, united to declare that they considered Bothwell a proper person to recommend the widowed Queen to accept as husband, pledging themselves “on their honour and fidelity … to further, advance and set forward such marriage betwixt her Highness and the said noble lord.”</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394720-00031">In pursuit thereof they would “spend and bestow” their “lives and goods, against all that live or die”, as they might “answer to God” upon their own “fidelities and conscience”.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394720-00032">Only one of the company, the Earl of Eglinton, misliking the bond, slipped away from the tavern before it was signed. The others obediently subscribed their names, for Bothwell’s stalwarts surrounded the houses—though many of the signatories were perhaps determined, when occasion offered, to break their pledged word. They knew that what is written in ink can be washed out with blood. Anyhow, no one entered a protest against signing. After this formality the company went on carousing gaily, and the merriest among them may well have been Bothwell, for now he had gained his ends. A few weeks later and the Queen of Scotland and the Isles would wed the murderer of her husband as heedlessly as did Hamlet’s mother wed Claudius. <i>Quos deus perdere vult</i> …
