         <p class="fp" id="rw-fp_394729-00001"><span class="dropcap">E</span><span class="sc">LIZABETH’S MINISTERS OF STATE</span> thus achieved their end. Mary Stuart innocently entered the trap, gave her “consent”, made herself “guilty”. Without stirring a finger, Elizabeth could let matters take their course, so that a legal decision would sweep her dangerous rival out of her path for ever. The struggle which had lasted for a quarter of a century was over. Elizabeth was victorious, and could rejoice as merrily as her subjects who, in the streets of London and elsewhere, were noisily celebrating the rescue of their sovereign and the triumph of the Protestant cause. But in every fulfilment, bitter is mingled with sweet in the cup. Now, when Elizabeth could strike, she hesitated. It had been far, far easier to entice a heedless prisoner into the snare than it was to slay her when the trap had closed on her. If Elizabeth had wanted to rid herself of the inconvenient captive by force, she had had ample opportunities ere this. Fifteen years earlier, parliament had requested that Queen Mary should be dealt with by the axe. In 1570, John Knox wrote to Cecil warning him “that, if he thrust not at the root, the branches, which appeared to be broken, would bud more quickly than men could believe, and with greater force than would be wished,” adding emphatically “God grant you wisdom” and signing “John Knox, with his one foot in the grave”.
         </p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394729-00001">Always when thus urged to take sharp measures, Elizabeth answered: “I cannot slay the dove which, pursued by a falcon, has flown to me for help.” Now, however, what choice was left her, when the Babington conspiracy (Walsingham’s plot!) convinced her that the choice lay between her own life or Mary’s? Nevertheless, Elizabeth continued to shrink from a decision, for she knew what immense possibilities, moving in ever-widening circles, were involved. It is hard for us of a later day to understand how newfangled, how revolutionary, was the thought of executing Mary Queen of Scotland and the Isles—a notion at which the hierarchy of the western world shuddered. To send an anointed queen to the scaffold was a plain demonstration to the hitherto servile people of Europe that even a monarch was subject to doom at the hands of the executioner, and could not be regarded as sacrosanct. Thus Elizabeth’s decision implied, not merely the doom of a fellow creature, but the doom of an idea. For centuries the slaughtering of this idea would work havoc among the kings of this world. The execution of Queen Mary would be a precedent for the execution of King Charles I, her grandson; and the execution of King Charles, in its turn, would be a precedent for the execution of Louis XVI and of Marie Antoinette. Thus does destiny work. Elizabeth, taking long views, and having a strong sense of responsibility, perceived the far-reaching implications of her decision. She hesitated, vacillated and procrastinated. Once more there became active in her, perhaps more active than ever, the struggle between reason and feeling, the war of Elizabeth against Elizabeth. It is always a moving spectacle when we contemplate a fellow human being wrestling with conscience.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394729-00002">Oppressed by this bipolarity of purpose, Elizabeth tried to evade the inevitable. Again and again she refused to decide; again and again decision was forced upon her. Thus, once more, at the last moment, she tried to shuffle responsibility off upon Mary. She wrote the latter a letter (indubitably penned, though it has not come down to us) in which she asked Mary to make her a confidential communication, as from one queen to another. Mary was to avow participation in the conspiracy, and submit to Elizabeth’s personal judgement, instead of being tried in open court.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394729-00003">This proposal was the only way out of the difficulty, short of public trial and execution. It would spare Mary the humiliations that were otherwise unavoidable. From Elizabeth’s standpoint, it would provide an infallible safeguard if this dangerous pretender to her throne consented to make an avowal in her own handwriting. It would give Elizabeth a firm moral hold on Mary. Thenceforward Mary, disarmed by her concession, could go on living quietly in obscurity, and Elizabeth would be tranquil in the fierce light that beats upon a throne. Each member of the pair would be assigned a separate role. No longer would Elizabeth Tudor and Mary Stuart stand as foes and equals on the stage of history, for Mary would have become a penitent on her knees before one who had graciously pardoned her and granted her her life.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394729-00004">But Mary no longer wished to be saved. The strongest of her instincts was pride, and she would rather kneel to lay her head on the block than kneel before a protectress, would rather tell a preposterous falsehood than make a plain confession, would rather perish than humble herself. She was therefore deaf to this offer, which implied debasement as well as salvation. She knew that as a sovereign ruler she had played and lost. Only one power was left to her on earth, that of putting her adversary Elizabeth in the wrong. Since she could no longer do her enemy direct harm, she would use the sole weapon that remained to her, would relentlessly manifest Elizabeth’s culpability to the world by dying a glorious death.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394729-00005">Mary rejected the proffered hand. Elizabeth, egged on by Cecil and Walsingham, was forced to adopt a course she loathed. To give the proposed trial a legal justification, the crown lawyers were summoned, and crown lawyers are wont to find good legal grounds for whatever the wearer of the crown wishes to do. Busily they sought for precedents, showing that, ere this, kings and queens had been tried before the courts; that the accusation of Mary was not a manifest breach with tradition, not an entirely new thing in the world. The examples they were able to discover were not very impressive: Cajetanus, an obscure tetrarch, who had been put to death fifteen hundred years before; Licinius, Constantine’s brother-in-law, equally unknown; finally Conradin of Hohenstaufen and Joanna of Naples—these were the only sovereigns who could be shown to have lost their lives through a decision of a law court. In their servility, the crown lawyers went so far as to declare that the court of nobles Elizabeth proposed to appoint was superfluous. They held it would suffice, since Mary Stuart’s crime had been committed in Staffordshire, to bring her before a common jury of that county. This democratic suggestion did not suit Elizabeth at all. She wanted to observe the forms. One who was the leading living descendant of the House of Stuart and (herself apart) also of the House of Tudor was to be done away with in right royal fashion, with pomp and circumstance, with the respect and the reverence due to a woman who had been a reigning sovereign. She must not be shuffled out of the way by the verdict of a few farmers and burgesses. Elizabeth angrily declared: “That would be a strange sort of procedure to take against a princess. I deem it right to avoid such absurdities, and to entrust the examination of so important a matter to a sufficient number of the noblest persons and judges in this land. For we princesses stand on the world’s stage in full sight of the world.” A royal trial, a royal execution, a royal burial were Mary Stuart’s right, and therefore Elizabeth selected forty-six commissioners from among the noblest and most distinguished in her realm.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394729-00006">Mary Stuart, however, had no inclination to allow herself to be examined or sentenced by even the most blue-blooded subjects of her sister queen. When, on 11th October 1586, Mary being ill in bed at the time, Paulet introduced Sir Walter Mildmay and Barker, the notary, into her bedchamber, to deliver Queen Elizabeth’s letter, which announced the decision to bring her to trial before the commissioners, Mary burst forth indignantly: “Doth not your mistress know that I am a queen by birth? Or thinketh she that I will so far prejudice my rank and station, the blood whereof I am descended, the son who is to succeed me, and the majesty of other princes, as to yield obedience to her commands? My mind is not yet so far dejected, neither will sink nor faint under this mine adversity.”</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394729-00007">But, by an eternal law, character is destiny, and neither good fortune nor bad can wholly change it. Mary’s merits and defects remained the same throughout life. Always, in moments of grave peril, she could react with outstanding dignity; but always, in the end, she would show herself too indifferent, too inert, to defend herself resolutely and persistently against prolonged pressure. Just as, at the time of the York Conference, she had abandoned the strong position of her claim to inviolable sovereignty, and had thus dropped the only weapon Elizabeth feared, so was it now. Early on the morning of 14th October, Mary declared her willingness to appear before the commissioners—she thereby admitted the jurisdiction of Queen Elizabeth’s court.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394729-00008">On this fourteenth day of October 1586, a great spectacle was staged in the hall of Fotheringay Castle. At one end of the big room had been set up a dais, with a canopy and a chair of state surmounted with the arms of England, after the manner of a throne, to symbolise the invisible presence of England’s Queen, as supreme authority. To right and to left were ranged in order of precedence the various commissioners; before them was a table for the use of the prosecuting counsel, the presiding judge, other lawyers and minute-takers. Mary Stuart entered, supported on one side by her physician, Bourgoigne, and on the other by Andrew Melville, her master of the household. As usual throughout the years of her imprisonment, she was dressed in black. On entering, she looked contemptuously round the assembly and said, with scorn: “How many lawyers are here assembled, and not one of them to represent me.” Then she made her way to the chair that had been placed for her, not beneath the royal canopy, but a few steps from the empty throne. The “overlordship” the suzerainty of England over Scotland, which the northern land had persistently repudiated, was symbolised here by the loftier position of Elizabeth’s throne. Mary would not let this pass without protest. “I am a queen by birth, and have been the consort of a king of France. My place should be there,” she said, glancing at the vacant seat beneath the canopy.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394729-00009">The proceedings were formally opened. Just as at York and at Westminster, so now, the most primitive legal considerations were disregarded. As at the conferences, many years before, the principal witnesses, Bothwell’s servants, had been executed with suspicious haste, so on this occasion had Babington and his associates been jostled out of the world before Mary’s trial began. Nothing but their alleged confessions, extorted under fear of imminent death, were laid before the court. By a further amazing breach of justice, even the incriminating letters upon which so much stress was laid, the missives from Mary Stuart to Babington and from Babington to Mary Stuart, were not read aloud from the reputed originals, but from transcripts. Mary Stuart protested against this use of Phelippes’s decipherments. “Nay,” she said, “bring me my own handwrit; anything to suit a purpose may be put in what you do call copies. Also, it is an easy matter to counterfeit ciphers and characters, if others have got the alphabet used for such correspondence.” Then she went on to hint at Walsingham’s plan for her destruction and that of her son.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394729-00010">Legally, the Queen of Scots had ground for a vigorous defence along the line here indicated, and had she been represented by counsel, much stress would have been laid upon the matter. But Mary stood alone before the judges, ignorant of English law, unaware of what incriminating material could be produced against her and, to her disaster, she made the mistake she had made at York and Westminster. She did not confine herself to protests against certain suspicious circumstances in the accusation, but denied the charges against her in block, thus trying to refute much that was irrefutable. She began by denying all knowledge of Babington, but was compelled, on the second day of the trial, under stress of the proofs put in, to admit that she was acquainted with him by correspondence. This mistaken repudiation, which she was forced to withdraw, weakened her moral position, and it was too late to try a return to the old standpoint, to demand “as a queen” the right of being believed on the strength of her royal word. It was of no avail for her to exclaim: “I came to this land relying upon the friendship and the pledges of the Queen of England, who had sent me a ring in token that I could so rely.” For Mary’s judges were not trying her that right, which is eternal and inviolable, should prevail, but simply that they might secure peace at long last for their own Queen and their own country. The verdict had been settled before the hearing; and when, on the twenty-fifth of the month, the commissioners reassembled in the Star Chamber at Westminster, only one of them, Lord zouche, was bold enough to declare himself unsatisfied that the Scottish Queen “had compassed, practised or imagined” the death of Elizabeth. Thus the verdict was robbed of the charm of unanimity, but all the other commissioners subserviently decided as they had been told. Promptly a scrivener set to work, writing fair on parchment the court’s decision that “the aforesaid Mary Stuart, a pretender to the crown of this kingdom of England, had approved and devised various plans for the purpose of injuring, destroying or slaying the royal person of our sovereign lady the Queen of England.” Parliament had already decreed that punishment for such plots against Elizabeth’s life was to be death.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394729-00011">It had been incumbent on the assembled nobles to utter the verdict and pass sentence. The verdict had been “guilty”, and the sentence one of death. Elizabeth, however, the Queen of England, was the incorporation of the highest powers in the realm, and could exercise the humane, the generous right of clemency. With her it ultimately rested whether the death sentence should be carried out or should be annulled. Once more a choice she hated was forced upon her. What would she do? Again Elizabeth was marshalled against Elizabeth. As in the tragedies of the ancient Greek playwrights the chorus was ranged to right and to left of a conscience-stricken principal, uttering strophe and antistrophe, so now did Elizabeth hear voices both within and without, some urging her to be inflexible, and others imploring her to be forgiving. Above them all looked down unseen the supreme judge of human actions, History, whose voice is silent while the actors still live, and who utters the verdict only when the curtain has fallen on them for ever. The right wing of the chorus was loud and inexorable in clamouring<i>—</i>“Death, death, death.” The Lord High Treasurer, the Privy Council, Elizabeth’s closest friends (such as Leicester), the lords and the commons—one and all considered that the execution of Mary Stuart was the only way of securing tranquillity for the realm and peace of mind and safety for its Queen. Both Houses of Parliament adopted an address to the Queen’s most Gracious Majesty praying that sentence of death be executed forthwith against Mary. “We cannot find that there is any possible means to provide for Your Majesty’s safety but by the just and speedy execution of the said Queen, the neglecting whereof may procure the heavy displeasure and punishment of Almighty God.”
         </p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394729-00012">To Elizabeth this insistence was welcome. She wanted the world at large to know that she personally had no desire to make an end of Mary Stuart, but that the English nation urged upon her the necessity of carrying out the sentence. The louder, the plainer the condemnatory voices, the better. Then she would be given a chance of performing a great aria of clemency and humaneness upon the world stage and, ever a play-actress, she made the most of her opportunity. She fervently acknowledged receipt of the exhortation of parliament, humbly thanking Almighty God that by His will she had been delivered from deadly peril. Thereafter, speaking in louder tones, she addressed the wider world and the tribunal of history, wishing to disclaim responsibility for Mary Stuart’s fate.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394729-00013">“Although mine own life hath been in such deadly peril, I avow that nothing hath distressed me more than that one of mine own sex, of equal rank and birth, and so nearly akin to me by blood, should have been guilty of so great a crime. So far am I from being moved by malice that, immediately after the disclosure of certain traitorous proceedings against myself, I wrote to her privately to the effect that if she would make avowal of her guilt to me in a private letter everything could be settled quietly. I did not write to her this-wise in order to lure her into a trap, since I already was fully informed as to anything she could admit to me. But now, when matters have gone so far, even now, if she would openly admit her penitence, and if no one any longer were in her name to push her cause against me, I would willingly pardon her, were no more at stake than my own life, and not the safety and welfare of my realm. It is for your sake and that of my people that I wish to go on living.” Then comes a frank admission that her hesitation is determined by her dread of the verdict of history. “For we princes stand, as it were, upon a stage, exposed to the prying glances of the world. The slightest speck upon our raiment is noticed, any weakness of ours is quickly recorded, so that we must be sedulous more than others that our actions shall always be just and honourable.” For this reason she begged parliament to excuse her for not coming to an immediate decision, seeing that “it is my wont, even in matters of far less moment, to deliberate long before coming to a final decision.”</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394729-00014">Was this rigmarole truth or falsehood? Both; for, to repeat, Elizabeth was bipolar. She wanted to be freed from her adversary, but at the same time desired to pose before the world as magnanimous and clement. Twelve days later she sent to Cecil to enquire whether it would not be possible to spare Mary Stuart’s life while safeguarding her own. Once more the Privy Council and parliament assured Queen Elizabeth that there was no other way out of the difficulty than Queen Mary’s execution. Now let us hear Elizabeth once more. This time her words have the unmistakable ring of truth. “I am this day more in conflict with myself than ever before in my life, as to whether I shall speak or be silent. Were I to speak and to complain, I should play the hypocrite; were I to remain silent, all your pains would have been lost. It may seem strange to you that I should complain, but I must avow it hath always been my innermost wish to find some other way of achieving your safety and mine own welfare than the one that is proposed … Since, however, it hath now been determined that my safety cannot be secured in any other way than by her death, I am profoundly mournful that I, who have pardoned so many rebels and have passed over so many acts of treason in silence, should be compelled to show cruelty towards so highly placed a princess.” Reading between the lines, we can see that she is only asking to be over-persuaded. But, ambiguous as ever, she cannot utter a clear Yes or a plain No, for she concludes with the words: “I beg you to content yourselves for the nonce with an answer which is no answer. I do not withstand your opinion, I understand your reason and I beg you to accept my gratitude, to excuse my inward doubts and not to take it amiss that I send you an answer which is no answer.”</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394729-00015">The voices on the right have spoken. They have clamoured Death, Death, Death. But the voices on the left, the voices accordant with the best promptings of her heart, were also speaking loudly. The King of France sent a special envoy to talk of the common interests of monarchs. He reminded Elizabeth that by defending Mary’s inviolability she would be defending her own; he exhorted her not to forget that the first rule for one who wished to reign well and happily must be to avoid bloodshed. He reminded her that the right of hospitality was sacred among all nations. Elizabeth must not sin against God by touching the head of an anointed queen. Since Elizabeth, playing the game of shilly-shally as usual, would reply only with half-assurances and ambiguous utterances, the tone of the foreign envoys grew louder. What had at first been no more than request became imperious warnings, and then open threats. Elizabeth, however, trained by nearly three decades on the throne in the intricacies of political life, had fine hearing. When addressed in this emotional way, she listened for only one thing, to learn whether, in the folds of their togas, the diplomatists had hidden commissions to break off relations and declare war. She was quick to perceive that behind the loud and blustering words there was no clash of arms, that neither Henry III nor Philip II was prepared to draw the sword and to let slip the dogs of war as soon as the axe fell upon Mary Stuart’s neck.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394729-00016">Thus she was content to shrug her shoulders at the diplomatic stage thunder of France and Spain. She had, doubtless, to show more caution in thrusting aside another objection, that of Scotland. For if any one on earth should regard it as a sacred duty to prevent the execution of a queen of Scotland in a strange land, it was James VI, since the blood which was to be shed ran in his own veins, since the woman whose life was to be taken was she who had given him life, his mother. Not that James was likely to be stirred by filial affection. Having become Elizabeth’s pensioner and ally, it seemed to him that the mother who denied his royal title, who had invoked maledictions upon him, and had tried to sell his heritage to foreign monarchs was nothing but an obstacle in his path. Directly he heard of the discovery of the Babington conspiracy, he sent congratulations to Queen Elizabeth; and when the French ambassador, seeking him out engaged in his favourite occupation of the chase, begged him to use his influence on his mother’s behalf, young James replied angrily “<i>qu’il fallait qu’elle but la boisson qu’elle avait brassée</i>”—that she must drink the potion she had brewed. He declared that he recked little “how closely she might be imprisoned, and whether all her base servants were hanged.” The best thing would be that in future she should confine her attention to praying to God. It was no affair of his, and, in actual fact, the hard-hearted son refused for some time even to send an embassy to London. Not until his mother had been condemned to death, and nationalist feeling blazed up over Scotland because the Queen of a foreign land was about to slay their own anointed monarch, did the young man realise how poor a figure he would cut if he remained inactive. For form’s sake, at least, he must do something. He would not, indeed, go so far as the Scottish parliament demanded, and declare his intention to make war on England should the execution take place. Still, he sat down at his writing desk, penned energetic, menacing dispatches to Walsingham and sent an embassy to London.
         </p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394729-00017">Of course Elizabeth had expected this protest. Here, likewise, she did not take it at its face value, but listened for the fundamental tone. The deputies of James VI consisted of two groups. The official ones, those who stood in the public eye, made reiterated and loud demands for the annulment of the death sentence. They rattled their swords, breathed threatenings and slaughter, and those among them who were Scottish nobles displayed the fervour of genuine patriotism. They did not suspect that, while they were voicing these menaces in the royal reception room, behind the scenes another agent, a confidential representative of James VI, had been admitted to Queen Elizabeth’s private apartments, to negotiate with her, on the quiet, about a very different matter, which was far more important to the King of Scotland than his mother’s life, namely his recognition as heir to the English throne. We learn from the French ambassador, who was well informed as to what was going on, that this secret envoy of James VI had been commissioned to tell Elizabeth that, if James was uttering loud threats, this was done only “for his honour and reputation”. Elizabeth should not take his violence “in ill part”. Thus Elizabeth was plainly told what was probably no news to her, namely that James VI, far from being outraged at the prospect of his mother’s execution, was prepared “to digest it” if only there were held out to him the enticement of a pledge or a half-pledge of his succession to the throne. The negotiations that now went on were of a most unsavoury character. Mary Stuart’s chief enemy and her only son drew near together, being both moved by the same dark purpose, for both secretly wished Mary Stuart to be swept out of their path, provided only that the world should not know with what feelings they were animated. They wanted her dead, but had, before the public eye, to behave as if their most heartfelt wish were to protect her. In reality Elizabeth was not trying to preserve her “sister’s” life, nor James VI his mother’s, each of them being only concerned to keep up a good appearance “on the world stage”. James had long since shown plainly enough that he would make no difficulties for Elizabeth though the worst should happen, thus giving her a free hand for the execution of his mother. Before Elizabeth sent Mary to her death, Mary’s son had sacrificed her.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394729-00018">Elizabeth now knew that neither France nor Spain nor Scotland, nor anyone else in the wide world, would trouble her in earnest should she decide that “the matter must come to an end.” There was only one person who, perhaps, might still save Mary Stuart—Mary Stuart herself. She need merely sue for pardon, and it is probable that Elizabeth would have been satisfied with this triumph. At the bottom of her heart she was waiting for such an appeal, which would salve her sore conscience. Everything possible was done during these last weeks to break Mary’s pride. As soon as sentence had been passed, Elizabeth told Sir Amyas Paulet to inform the prisoner of what had happened, whereupon this arid and sober-minded official, who was all the more repulsive for his impeccability, took the opportunity of affronting the condemned, who for him was nothing more, now, than “<i>une femme morte sans nulle dignité</i>”—a dead woman without any dignity. He clapped his hat on his head and sat down in her presence, showing the stupid malevolence of one who takes delight in another’s misfortune; he ordered his servants to tear down her canopy of state which was decorated with the arms of Scotland. Her attendants refused to obey the jailer’s orders, and when Paulet made his own menials do the dirty work, Mary hung up a crucifix where the arms of Scotland had been, in order to show that a higher power than Scotland was watching over her. To every dictatorial affront she was ready to reply with a moving gesture. “They threatened to slay me if I do not ask for pardon,” she wrote to her friends, “but I reply that if they have already determined upon my death, they may consummate their injustice when they please.” Let Elizabeth murder her; so much the worse for Elizabeth! Better a death which would humble her adversary before the tribunal of history, than acceptance of a feigned clemency which would invest Elizabeth with the halo of magnanimity. Instead of protesting against the death sentence or begging for grace, as a sincere Christian she meekly thanked God for all His mercies. But to Elizabeth she replied proudly as one queen to another:

         <p class="fp" id="rw-p_394729-00024">Strangely, and contrary to all expectations, were the roles reversed during the last days of this long-enduring struggle. After Mary Stuart was informed of the death sentence, her self-confidence returned. Her heart pulsed unperturbed; but Elizabeth’s hand trembled when she signed the death warrant. Mary Stuart was less afraid to die than Elizabeth Tudor was to kill. Mary had long been tired of her earthly pilgrimage, and yearned for eternal rest. She spent her hours in serious preparation for the end. She made her will, dividing her worldly goods among her domestic staff; she wrote letters to her colleagues, or those who had been her colleagues when she was still on the throne; no longer to incite them into sending armies and equipping for war, but in order to assure them that she was ready to die in the Catholic faith and for the Catholic faith. This restless heart had at length found peace. Fear and hope, “the worst enemies of man”, as Goethe calls them, could no longer trouble her spirit. Like her sister in misfortune, Marie Antoinette, it was under the shadow of imminent death that Mary Queen of Scotland and the Isles realised her true task. The sense of historical responsibility completely dispelled her previous indifference. She gave no thought to the possibilities of pardon, but wanted only to die an impressive death, to triumph in the last moment. She knew that nothing but a dramatic and heroic end could make the world forgive the tragic errors of her life, and that nothing more could be vouchsafed to her than a worthy exit.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394729-00025">An extraordinary contrast to the dignity and composure of the doomed woman in Fotheringay Castle was shown by the uncertainty, the tantrums, the perplexity, the wrathful outbursts of Elizabeth in London. Mary Stuart’s mind was composed and tranquil, whereas Elizabeth Tudor was still wrestling for a decision. Never had the Queen of England suffered so much at the hands of her rival the Queen of Scotland as when the latter defencelessly awaited an unjust doom. Elizabeth was unable to sleep; she passed day after day in gloomy silence; her spirit was obsessed with the intolerable problem as to whether she should have the death sentence carried out. She tried to thrust aside the thought as Sisyphus rolled his stone uphill, but always it rolled back again to crush her. Vainly did her ministers of state address her; she could listen only to the voice of her own conscience. Rejecting one proposal after another, she was continually asking for new ones. Cecil found her “as changeable as the weather”; at one time she was for death, at another for pardon; again and again she asked her friends whether there was not some alternative, although at the bottom of her heart she knew there could be no such thing. If only what was to happen could happen without her knowledge, without her express order, be done for her instead of by her! She feverishly struggled to evade responsibility, perpetually weighing and reweighing the advantages and disadvantages of so conspicuous a deed. To the despair of her advisers, she put off her decision with ambiguous, irritable, nervous and unintelligible phrases, always noncommittal. “With weariness to talk, Her Majesty left off all till a time I know not when,” complained Cecil, who, cold and reasonable, could not understand the distress of Elizabeth’s tortured soul. Though she had put a harsh jailer in charge of Mary Stuart, she was herself in thrall to a yet harsher one, the most cruel on earth, her conscience. This struggle of Elizabeth against Elizabeth, this inability to decide whether she should listen to the voice of reason or to the voice of humanity, went on for three months, four months, five months, nearly half a year. Her nerves being thus overwrought, it was but natural that the final decision, when it came, should take the form of an explosion.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394729-00026">On Wednesday, 1st February 1587, William Davison, Queen Elizabeth’s private secretary (Walsingham, by luck or cunning, was indisposed during, these days), in the gardens at Greenwich, was unexpectedly informed by Admiral Howard that Her Majesty needed his services on the instant, and that he was to bring her Mary Stuart’s death warrant for signature. Davison procured the document, which Cecil had written with his own hand, and conveyed it with a number of other papers to the Queen. But, strangely enough, Elizabeth, the great play-actress, now seemed in no hurry to sign. She counterfeited indifference, talked to Davison about other matters, looked out of the window and remarked what a bright and beautiful winter morning it was. Then she asked the secretary casually (had she really forgotten she had sent for him to bring the death warrant?) what those papers were on the table. Davison replied, “Instruments for Your Majesty’s signature,” and among them one which Lord Howard had specially charged him to bring. Elizabeth picked them up and signed them in rapid succession without looking at them, including, of course, Mary Stuart’s death warrant. This was according to plan, so that she could pretend, afterwards, that she had signed the fatal deed unsuspectingly among other papers of minor importance. But then came one of her weathercock changes. Her next remark showed that she knew perfectly well what she had been about, for she assured Davison that she had delayed so long in signing the warrant only in order to show clearly that her assent was most unwilling. Still, now it had been signed, he must take it to Cecil, that the Great Seal might be put to it. “Do it secretly,” she added, “for it may prove dangerous to me were it to be known before the execution actually takes place.” When the warrant had been sealed, it was to be carried into effect by the proper parties. The orders were clear, leaving Davison in no doubt that Her Majesty’s mind was made up. The fact that the Queen had long thought the affair over in all its details was shown by her further instructions to Davison. The execution was to take place in the great hall of Fotheringay Castle, for neither the front court nor the inner court was suitable. She reiterated her demand for secrecy as to the signing of the warrant. But having been able to make up her mind at last seemed to have relieved the strain. This put her in a merry mood. She chuckled as she told Davison that, when Walsingham learnt what she had done, “the grief thereof will go near to kill him outright.”</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394729-00027">Davison believed, as well he might, that his instructions were ended. He bowed and made for the door. Elizabeth, however, could never decide unhesitatingly, and those who thought she had done so were apt to find themselves mistaken. She called Davison back from the door, her merriment having passed, and her real or feigned resolution having been dissipated. Uneasily the Queen paced up and down the room. Was there not another way? After all, the “Members of the Association” had sworn to kill anyone who should attempt her assassination. Since Sir Amyas Paulet and his companion Sir Drue Drury at Fotheringay were members of the “Association”, was it not their unquestioned duty to do the deed, and to relieve her, the Queen, from the odium of a public execution? Let Walsingham write to the pair of them in that sense.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394729-00028">The worthy Davison became uneasy. It was plain to him the Queen wished the deed done without herself having part or lot in it. One may well suppose that the secretary regretted having had no witnesses to this important conversation. Still, what could he do? His orders were plain. He therefore went first to Cecil; the Great Seal was affixed to the warrant; then he went on to Walsingham, who forthwith composed a letter to Sir Amyas Paulet in the sense desired. Her Majesty, said Walsingham, “doth note in you both a lack of that care and zeal of her service that she looketh for at your hands … In that you have not in all this time of yourselves (without other provocation) found out some way to shorten the life of that Queen, considering the great peril she is subject unto hourly, so long as the said Queen shall live.” Especially the recipients of the letter should bear in mind that they had “good warrant and ground” for the satisfaction of their consciences towards God and the discharge of their credit and reputation towards the world, “in the oath of association which you both have so solemnly taken and vowed, especially the matter wherewith she stands in charge being so clearly and manifestly proved against her.” The letter went on to say that Elizabeth “taketh it most unkindly towards her, that men professing that love towards her that you do, should in any kind of thought, for lack of the discharge of your duties, cast the burthen upon her, knowing as you do her indisposition to shed blood, especially of one of that sex and quality, and so near to her in blood as the said Queen is.”</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394729-00029">This letter can hardly have reached Sir Amyas Paulet, and certainly the answer from Fotheringay could not have got back to London, when a change of wind set in at Greenwich. Next morning, Thursday, a messenger knocked at Davison’s door with a note from the Queen. “If the secretary has not yet taken the warrant to the chancellor for the affixing of the Great Seal, let him wait until Her Majesty has had a further talk with him.” Davison hastened to the Queen and told her that, as ordered, he had already had the death warrant sealed. Elizabeth made her discontent plain, showing this by the expression of her countenance, but did not blame Davison in so many words and, above all, refrained from ordering him to bring back the signed and sealed death warrant. She complained once more of the fresh burdens that were continually being laid upon her shoulders. Restlessly she wandered up and down the room. Davison stood to his guns, humbly waiting for decisive orders. Suddenly Elizabeth quitted the room, without saying another word.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394729-00030">It was a Shakespearian scene that Elizabeth was playing before an audience of one. We cannot but think of Richard III complaining that his adversary Buckingham is alive without giving clear orders for the murder. The same injured look of King Richard III, when his vassals understand him and yet pretend not to understand, had been flashed by Elizabeth at the unhappy Davison. He felt that he was on slippery ground and tried to find securer footing. He did not wish to stand alone in a position of such overwhelming responsibility. Seeking out Sir Christopher Hatton, a close friend of the Queen who had been one of the commissioners at Fotheringay, Davison explained that he, the secretary, was in a ticklish position. Elizabeth had commanded him to have the Great Seal affixed to the death warrant, after she had signed it, but her demeanour that morning made it obvious that she was in a mood to repudiate her orders. Hatton knew Elizabeth’s whimsies too well not to understand, but he, likewise, was disinclined to speak in candid terms to poor Davison. The comedy of trying to shift responsibility was carried a stage further. Elizabeth had thrown the ball to Davison; Davison passed it on to Hatton; Hatton, in his turn, brought Cecil into the game. The Lord High Treasurer was no less disinclined than the others had been to shoulder full responsibility, but he summoned a meeting of the Privy Council for the next day. All Elizabeth’s intimates and closest confidants were present, Leicester, Hatton and ten other men of rank who had had ample experience of the Queen’s untrustworthiness. At the council, for the first time the matter was discussed in plain English. They were agreed that Queen Elizabeth, for the sake of her moral prestige, wished to avoid any appearance of having commanded the execution of Mary Stuart. She wanted to present herself before the world as “astonished” by an accomplished fact. It was, therefore, the duty of her loyal lieges to play up to her and, in apparent defiance of the Queen’s will, do what she really wanted and would not expressly command. Of course this was to take an enormous responsibility, and <i>j </i>therefore the weight of her genuine or simulated anger must not fall upon one individual. Cecil’s proposal was that they should jointly order the execution and jointly accept responsibility for it. Lord Kent and Lord Shrewsbury were instructed to see to the carrying out of the death sentence, and Beale, clerk of the Council, was sent with the necessary orders to Fotheringay. Thus the possible blame would fall upon all the members of the Privy Council who had been present at this meeting, and by their transgression of the limits of their powers—a transgression which Elizabeth secretly desired—they would remove the “burthen” from the Queen.
         </p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394729-00031">One of Elizabeth’s most conspicuous characteristics was her curiosity. She always wanted to know, and to know forthwith, everything that was going on in her palace and throughout her realm. Yet on this occasion, strangely enough, she asked neither Davison nor Cecil nor anyone else what had been done with the death warrant she had signed. For three whole days she seemed to have utterly forgotten a matter upon which her mind had been concentrated for months past. She did not ask once more whether the document had been sealed, and in whose hands it then was. As if she had drunk of the waters of Lethe, this momentous affair seemed to have vanished from her memory. When next morning, Sunday, Sir Amyas Paulet’s answer to her proposal that he and Drury should murder Mary arrived, she never enquired where the signed and sealed death warrant might be. Paulet’s answer was by no means to the Queen’s taste. He instantly perceived how ungrateful a task was being assigned to him. He was to make an end of Mary Stuart, and for what reward? The Queen would then have him accused of the murder and hand him over to justice. Sir Amyas Paulet did not expect gratitude from any member of the House of Tudor, and had no inclination to be made a scapegoat of. Lest he might seem disobedient, the shrewd puritan appealed to a yet higher authority than the Queen’s, namely to God. He wrapped his refusal in the cloak of morality. His reply was, of course, to Sir Francis Walsingham, and not to Queen Elizabeth direct.</p>

         </div> 
         <p class="fp" id="rw-p_394729-00033">But Elizabeth was by no means inclined to take in good part this dutiful answer of her trusty Paulet, whom shortly before she had so enthusiastically praised on account of his “spotless actions, wise orders and safe regards.” Angrily she tramped up and down the room, shouting that she could not stomach those “dainty and precise fellows” who would promise everything and perform nothing. Paulet was a perjurer. He had signed the Bond of Association undertaking to serve the Queen at risk of his own life. “But I can do without him,” she screamed. “I have Wingfield, who will not draw back.” With real or pretended wrath she stormed at the unhappy Davison (Walsingham was better advised in being laid up at the moment!), who, with lamentable simplicity, assured her that the legal method was best. “Wiser men than you,” said Elizabeth contemptuously, “hold different opinions.” It was time that the matter was settled once for all, and a scandal to everyone concerned that she had not been freed from the “burthen” of responsibility.</p> 
         <p id="rw-p_394729-00034">Davison held his tongue. He might have replied to his royal mistress that steps to make an end to the matter once for all had already been taken. He knew, however, that nothing he could say would be more distasteful to the Queen than an honest assurance of what she already knew and pretended not to know—that the messenger carrying the signed and sealed death warrant was on his way to Fotheringay, accompanied by a thickset and burly man who was to translate words into blood, commands into performance—the London executioner.</p>
