<h1 class="para-ct">Ordinary Time</h1>
<p class="para-pf stickupcaps char-dropcap-DC cso_18-DC sans-dc" style="text-indent: 0;">E<span class="char-first cso_10"><span class="smallcaps">ASTER HAS POURED ITSELF OUT, </span></span>and now we members of the church are stumbling through what the church calendar calls “Ordinary Time,” the second installment of the phase traditionally beginning with Epiphany in early January and ending with Ash Wednesday. Ordinary Time picks up again after the mysteries of Easter and Jesus’ ascension into heaven have passed, and stretches<a id="GBS.0095.02"/> out to swallow the rest of the year. It is the space between. It is a time for baptisms and weddings, teaching and preaching without the highs and lows of Jesus’ cosmic interventions. Church attendance flags. There is no birth at the manger or death on the cross, just the ponderous pace of people singing, praying, and keeping their kids quiet during the sermon. The magic fades and reveals the church<a id="GBS.0095.03"/> for what it is: a plain people in a boring building who meet until kickoff.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page142" title="142"/>
<p class="para-p">Time is looped. Start treatment, manage the side effects, recover, start treatment. My weekly rituals revolve around Wednesdays, when I fly to Atlanta for chemotherapy. I wake up at 4:00 <span class="smallcaps char-sc">A.M.</span> and drive to the airport listening to a radio program about the wonders of the periodic table of elements, and I find myself telling<a id="GBS.0095.04"/> Toban later: “Next week it’s boron!” By 6:00 <span class="smallcaps char-sc">A.M</span>. I have parked, gone through airport security, answered most of my emails, and boarded the plane to Atlanta. The same plane that will bring me back at midnight, always to the soundtrack of people coughing and a nearby baby screaming herself unconscious.</p>
<p class="para-p">There are some interruptions to this ritual. Once I got into a lively discussion with airport<a id="GBS.0095.05"/> security about whether their slogan should be “The customer is always wrong!” Another time a pair of crutches fell from the overhead luggage bin onto my head and, in the dark of the plane, I spent an inappropriately long time trying to figure out if I was bleeding. But normally, the day is a blur of Atlanta traffic, needles, waiting rooms, and chemo chairs, with intermittent chatter. Determined<a id="GBS.0096.01"/> to charm the intake nurses, the blood-work nurses, and the enormous entourage of highly trained doctors who are working on this clinical trial, I wear myself out. I am starring in my own reality show about a young woman who gets cancer and is extremely cheerful about it. Except that no one is watching. By the time I crawl into bed at 1:00 <span class="smallcaps char-sc">A.M</span>., I am hollow. There is nothing left, except the budding<a id="GBS.0096.02"/> dread of knowing that next Wednesday I will do it all again.</p>

<p class="para-sp"><span class="char-first cso_10">I<span class="smallcaps"> AM STUCK IN </span></span>present tense. With a scan around every corner, I have lost the ability to make extended plans, to reach into the future and speak its language. I have lost the rhythm of anticipating the seasons. In the fall, my mom and I like to celebrate the first snow on the ground with homemade donuts, crispy apple fritters puffed<a id="GBS.0096.03"/> up with oil and sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar. In the winter, we drive out to see Grandpa at his retirement facility in a Mennonite town a few hours away and let all the children chase each other like puppies while the adults pretend to be indifferent about losing at Ping-Pong. The spring is about grading papers near the duck ponds in Duke Gardens. The summer is a liturgy of picnics and water<a id="GBS.0096.04"/> skiing on Ontario lakes, watching Toban’s annual reminder to himself that he is eerily graceful skating across the surface of the water, and seeing him grin like the boy I met at summer camp. But the year ahead is floating away, too far to see, and I must keep myself sewn into the present with its pills, needles, and white blood cell counts.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page144" title="144"/>
<p class="para-p">Sometimes this ability to live in the moment feels<a id="GBS.0096.05"/> like a gift. My pain feels connected to the pain of others somehow. I notice the look of exhaustion on the young mom’s face at the grocery store and help her with her cart. I stop to talk to the homeless man sitting on the corner. I give money away more freely, less begrudgingly. I can see now how hard people work to keep it together, but the walls that keep their lives from falling apart are brittle.<a id="GBS.0097.01"/> </p>
<p class="para-p">And I have two months to live. Again.</p>
<p class="para-p">I sit in a chemo chair with sixteen thousand dollars’ worth of immunotherapy drugs efficiently pumping into my body through a port in my chest. These are the kinds of numbers I can’t afford without insurance, and even if I could, I wouldn’t be able to get the drug. The clinical trial has special access to these restricted drugs, and millions of dollars<a id="GBS.0097.02"/> of pharmaceutical hopes and dreams are hanging on the news of how well they are performing in round after round of experimentation on people like me. The expectations are clear. Every sixty days I lie in a whirling CT machine, dye coursing through my veins, and the doctors measure whether the four plump tumors in my liver are growing. And if they are not, the doctors smile and agree to move on to<a id="GBS.0097.03"/> the next sixty days of treatment. I live for two months, take a deep breath, and hope to start over again.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page145" title="145"/>
<p class="para-p">In those moments before I can hear the oncologist pull the chart with my results from the holder on the wall outside, his hand on the door handle of the office, my mind goes back to the bridge.</p>
<p class="para-p"><em class="char-i">God, I am walking to the edge of a cliff. Build me a bridge. I need to get to the other side.</em></p>
<p class="para-p"><a id="GBS.0097.04"/>There are no new studies to assure me that anything will cure me or even keep me stable for long stretches of time. I am stepping out into the great void on the edge of what science can tell me. I just need sixty more days.</p>
<p class="para-p">It has been ten months since my diagnosis, and at a recent appointment, my oncologist drew a little chart on a scrap of paper.</p>
<p class="para-p">“This”—he drew a line—“is what we know so far<a id="GBS.0097.05"/> about people like you on immunotherapy drugs.”</p>
<p class="para-p">The line surged up and then went flat.</p>
<p class="para-p">“This”—he draws another—“is most people on chemotherapy with your condition.” The line curved up and then swooped down. He draws a couple more squiggles: people who do better, people who are average, and people who do worse. He points at a spot that represents where I am that day on the graph with an average<a id="GBS.0098.01"/> response to immunotherapy. I see it.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page146" title="146"/>
<p class="para-p">“So, if I weren’t on immunotherapy, now is when I would have begun to die.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Yes,” he says simply.</p>
<p class="para-p">This would be my last summer. This would be my last birthday. This would be the last month that Toban shoves his step counter in my face, kisses his biceps, and insists that he is getting fit faster than anyone in the history of step counters. This would be<a id="GBS.0098.02"/> the last time I sit on the floor in Zach’s room and swap out his clothes for the bigger box of sleepers and T-shirts. I would never see the house I grew up in again. This would begin the Great Goodbye.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Okay,” I said, “I understand.”</p>
<p class="para-p">I have tried, really tried, to make others understand. When the trial first started, yes, we had hoped that the tumors would shrivel up and disappear, and that<a id="GBS.0098.03"/> I would simply maintain my progress with a regimen of immunotherapies. That is how I made sense of the word <em class="char-i">incurable.</em> But in the intervening months, the tumors have stopped shrinking and our expectations for a full recovery have dried up. We hope instead that the tumors will not grow faster than the immunotherapies can shrink them. I need to make clear to my friends and family that I pray for<a id="GBS.0098.04"/> reduced cancer, but that I must be grateful for what I have. I have two more months of life. <em class="char-i">Hallelujah.</em></p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page147" title="147"/>
<p class="para-p">I try to put it in a little Facebook post, that mix of sun and cloud. I am trying to clear the emotional hurdles of using the words that show up on my chart. <em class="char-i">Palliative. Noncurative.</em> Or, we are hoping for a “manageable illness” in the face of no cure, but the comments section is a blurry mess<a id="GBS.0098.05"/> of “Don’t give up!” and “God bless you in your preparations.” It feels impossible to translate the kernel of truth: <em class="char-i">I’m not dying</em>. I am not terminal. <em class="char-i">I am keeping vigil in the place of almost death</em>. I stand in the in-between where everyone must pass, but so few can remain.</p>
<p class="para-p">I keep thinking that if my grandmother were still alive she would understand. When she was seventeen, she was diagnosed with<a id="GBS.0099.01"/> tuberculosis, wildly contagious and incurable back then, which wormed its way into her lungs and devoured her life whole. She had been at the top of her class and preparing to be the first person in her family to turn a razor wit into a college education. Instead, she breathed in an errant bacterial strain, so her parents packed her things in a trunk and sent her away to a tall stone sanitarium<a id="GBS.0099.02"/> so imposing that it earned the nickname Fort San. </p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page148" title="148"/>
<p class="para-p">I have seen pictures of where she was shuttered, and I imagine her, in the bloom of youth, watching from one of its windows as her life withered away. She could not have known that the young man who used to take her on his rounds driving the ice truck would not forget her. She could not have anticipated that a doctor would pioneer a way of cutting<a id="GBS.0099.03"/> deep into the tissues of her lungs to successfully carve out the infection. And she never would have imagined that the young man with the ice truck would make Fort San his first stop on his way home from the war, scoop her up, and take her to a little bungalow he’d built only for her. She could not have predicted that her world wouldn’t end in a locked white room.</p>
<p class="para-p">She had had many recurring episodes<a id="GBS.0099.04"/> in the hospital after her cure, times when her two baby boys were parceled out to relatives and friends for years while she was too sick to care for them and my grandfather traveled to keep the family afloat. These memories would press her into periods of intermittent sorrow, and her boys remembered these, and how she’d go into her room and turn the key. I still wear her ring, a blossom of<a id="GBS.0099.05"/> diamond flecks, which she meant for me. If she were here, she would understand the cost of living in the in-between.</p>

<p class="para-sp"><span class="char-first cso_10">I<span class="smallcaps"> KEEP RECEIVING LETTERS </span></span>from strangers about the cost of a life that goes on.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Forgive me, Kate,” they write, “but I have the opposite problem. I can’t justify my still being alive.” They are growing old, gathering years, but they do not feel they are amounting to something.<a id="GBS.0100.01"/> “It has become obvious to me that all this life is more than I deserve.”</p>
<p class="para-p">An old college professor writes from the deep of retirement. “I have seen <em class="char-i">good, good</em> people die young while I, who have not been a particularly good person, go on.” His losses are more than his gains. “At sixty-three,” says another, “I find myself so afraid of death. I am ashamed to admit how much I want more time, but I<a id="GBS.0100.02"/> have accomplished so little with what I’ve been given.” And then they turn to me. “You, my dear, deserve to have taken some of my wasted years.” A Buddhist promises to take on a special practice that will absorb my suffering and loan me his goodness. The world is a balance sheet. Subtract from one column, add to another, as if we could all agree to share pieces of this too-short, too-long life.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page150" title="150"/><a id="GBS.0100.03"/>
<p class="para-p">Instead, we plod along.</p>
<p class="para-p">People in my position, I suppose, think about the ultimate future, the life everlasting.</p>
<p class="para-p">But the first question I allowed myself to ask in the hours after being diagnosed was to my friend Frank, as Lutheran as a hot tuna dish.</p>
<p class="para-p">“You know how God’s time is different than ours…He sees everything, past and future, like it’s in the same moment? I mean, we believe that the<a id="GBS.0100.04"/> three members of the Trinity—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—always existed even though we think Jesus was born at a moment in time. But he always existed in another sense?” I was rambling, tumbling over my sentences trying to get to the point. I tried again.</p>
<p class="para-p">“But do you think that means that, when I die, I will see things from God’s perspective?” <em class="char-i">Say it. Just say it.</em></p>
<p class="para-p">“Do you think that when I<a id="GBS.0100.05"/> die…I won’t have to feel…apart?”</p>
<p class="para-p">At this point it wasn’t a question anymore. If I died, my son would never remember me, and so nothing in heaven held any interest for me. My eternal reward would have been that I missed it all. Frank folded his hands around mine and said something that, I’m sure, was both theologically rich and sound. But all I can remember now is that an old man who once lost<a id="GBS.0101.01"/> his boy understood what I needed time to be—a connective thread that wraps us all together for eternity.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page151" title="151"/>
<p class="para-p">In moments like this, my prosperity friends from all my years of research know me best. If poked and prodded, they would probably agree with me that, while heaven is great, it is even better when it is enjoyed here on earth. Technically, this is all heresy. It’s called an “overrealized eschatology,”<a id="GBS.0101.02"/> an exaggerated sense of what earth can reveal about the Kingdom of God. The famous Reverend Ike, pioneer of black televangelism, used to say it with a cheeky smile: “Don’t wait for your pie in the sky by and by; have it now with ice cream and a cherry on top!” But I don’t want ice cream, I want a world where there is no need for pediatric oncology, UNICEF, military budgets, or suicide rails<a id="GBS.0101.03"/> on the top floors of tall buildings. The world would drip with mercy. <em class="char-i">Thy kingdom come,</em> I pray, and my heart aches. And my tongue trips over the rest. <em class="char-i">Thy will be done.</em></p>
<p class="para-p">And maybe it’s one big disappointment. Before I got sick, I visited an actual enactment of what heaven would be like, sponsored by Jan and Paul Crouch, the omnipresent faces of Christian televangelism. This prosperity-preaching<a id="GBS.0101.04"/> duo owned the Trinity Broadcasting Network and, among other things, had purchased the Holy Land Experience, a sweet and gaudy biblical theme park devoted to retelling the life of Jesus—if Jesus had lived in Orlando, Florida. I ate a snack at Esther’s Banquet Hall and purchased the autobiography of Paul Crouch at the Gold, Frankincense and Myrrh gift shop. In their recent renovations, they had added<a id="GBS.0101.05"/> a few flourishes, including a dozen cardboard cutouts of Jan Crouch, a tiny, grinning woman supporting her trademark purple beehive, pointing guests to various destinations: this way to the Sermon on the Mount at 10:45 <span class="smallcaps char-sc">A.M</span>.; don’t miss the Crucifixion at 3:00 <span class="smallcaps char-sc">P.M</span>.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page152" title="152"/>
<p class="para-p">The death of Jesus was a giant bloodbath but touchingly portrayed by a man with very soulful eyes, and I did not once question why<a id="GBS.0102.01"/> everyone around me was crying. But when the resurrection sequence began at 4:00 <span class="smallcaps char-sc">P.M</span>., and cherubim and seraphim danced around the stage and solemn angels arrived to let the trumpets sound, I started to feel disappointed in the prospect of heaven. The actor playing Jesus appeared to enormous applause in a white robe with a long purple cape and a heavy gold crown, and paced the stage a few times,<a id="GBS.0102.02"/> but then the music swelled and Jesus walked through wall-to-wall mirrors misted with the thick white plumes of a fog machine, and I realized that heaven could just be a fog machine in Orlando.</p>
<p class="para-p">The future can seem awfully like the present. I remember standing on a windy hilltop in northern Israel with an elderly woman named Beverly, her shock of dyed red hair as fierce as the way she whispered<a id="GBS.0102.03"/> the name of the ancient site.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page153" title="153"/>
<p class="para-p">“Megiddo,” she said. “This is everything.”</p>
<p class="para-p">She spoke at a frantic pace as her eyes scanned the panoramic view, describing how the end-times armies would do battle below for the future of humankind. She gestured widely at the valleys at our feet.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Megiddo,” she said again. In Greek, the mountain went by its more common name, Armageddon, a byword for the end of time.<a id="GBS.0102.04"/> But every time the celebrity pastor we were traveling with uttered a prophecy, telling our assembly in conspiratorial tones that 2025 would bring Jesus back to earth to destroy the wicked and reward the righteous, Beverly tallied it to her life with painful specificity. It was too late. She would not live to see the world undone and remade.</p>
<p class="para-p">“And people didn’t even want to make the climb.” She<a id="GBS.0102.05"/> said it like she wanted to spit. Almost everyone was sitting comfortably in the tour buses below while she and I had made the trek up the mountain alone, her wobbly legs almost buckling by the final steps. Most of <em class="char-i">them</em> were going to live to see the day, and they didn’t even care. At the time I had thought: <em class="char-i">What an odd duck. Traveling all this way to stand on an apocalyptic mountaintop</em>.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page154" title="154"/>
<p class="para-p">Now I<a id="GBS.0103.01"/> understand that she needed the view, her eyes casting beyond her horizon. For a minute there, she needed to live in that beautiful, terrible someday.</p>

<p class="para-sp-alt"><span class="char-first cso_10">W<span class="smallcaps">HEN </span>I<span class="smallcaps"> WAS IN COLLEGE,</span></span> I took a class in the philosophy of religion from a wonderful old scholar, long past retirement age, who had spent his life working on a lovely translation of the Bhagavad Gita, an ancient Sanskrit text that lays out many of the fundamental precepts of Hinduism. But mostly he gave us book after<a id="GBS.0103.03"/> book about Hinduism’s understanding of reincarnation, perpetual rebirth into new lives and bodies, and how it had probably already been proven by scientists. But mostly I remembered him because he lost his wife of fifty-plus years that semester, not from disease or old age, but because she was hit by a car crossing the road near our campus. He was so stooped by sadness that he had to stop teaching<a id="GBS.0103.04"/> us, but in his last class I remember him saying that he couldn’t breathe when he found her things around the house.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page155" title="155"/>

<p class="para-p">He had believed that her life would go on and on, but she had gone on without him.<a id="GBS.0103.05"/> And he was here, stuck in her past.</p>
<p class="para-p">Beverly lived in the apocalyptic future, and the scholar lived in the past.

How could we improve our lives? What should we do next? As we walked through the tall Carolina oaks on a fall trail dusted with Technicolor leaves, my mind hummed with possible futures. Always. If I were to invent a sin to describe what that was—for how I lived—I would not say it was simply<a id="GBS.0104.02"/> that I didn’t stop to smell the roses. It was the sin of arrogance, of becoming impervious to life itself. I failed to love what was present and decided to love what was possible instead.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page156" title="156"/>

<p class="para-p">My treatment has been like a journey swinging on three vines. Two of these vines are chemotherapy drugs and one is the immunotherapy drug.

<p class="para-p">“I’d go to work,” he says, and I realize the weight of what he is saying. His office is plain and sensible, which confirms something I already know about him five minutes into our conversation. He has suffered and is there to work.</p>
<p class="para-p">In what were the worst moments of his life, he put one foot in front of the other. He tasked himself with a series of responsibilities that ultimately gave<a id="GBS.0106.01"/> me back this year. And maybe many more. But what I loved more than anything was that he did it without knowing it would matter. He marched forward because it was the best he could do.</p>
<p class="para-p">“We’re all terminal,” he says simply, and it answers my unspoken question. How do you stop? You just stop. You come to the end of yourself. And then you take a deep breath. And say a prayer. And get back to work.</p><a id="GBS.0106.02"/>
<p class="para-p">I have had cancer for a full year now. I called my mom before the surgery, one year ago today.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Frank told me the secret,” I said to her. But the more my mom pressed for details, the more it was obvious that I was on a lot of exciting painkillers. And that I had forgotten the secret entirely.</p>
<p class="para-p">I had asked him about heaven. He knew what I was asking because he always knows. Will I be connected?<a id="GBS.0106.03"/> Will I miss everything? Will I see my son sprout up and learn the rules of Canadian football? Can I see him graduate and be launched into the world? How many times can I sit beside his bed and watch his eyes squeeze tight as we thank God for tractors and the sticks we throw into the stream near our house. These are the plans I have made. These are the hopes that are being ground into dust.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page160" title="160"/>
<p class="para-p">And<a id="GBS.0106.04"/> then one day, out of the blue, I remembered what he said next.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Don’t skip to the end,” he said, gently. “Don’t skip to the end.”</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp"><span class="char-first cso_10"><span class="smallcaps">“</span>W<span class="smallcaps">HAT DO YOU THINK </span></span>I meant by that?” Frank said to me last week, sitting in my office. He can’t remember saying it because that day was such a blur. We are marveling at a whole year gone by, a whole year that the doctors said I had a 30 percent chance of surviving.</p><a id="GBS.0106.05"/>
<p class="para-p">“I think you meant that we just can’t know. And that our brains fill in all the details, for good or for ill. We want to tell ourselves a story—any story—so we can get back to certainty,” I reply. “You know me! I am so desperate to know what’s going to happen. At least so I can prepare.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“I sound really deep,” he says.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page161" title="161"/>
<p class="para-p">“I just need to make it to fifty. I need to make sure that kid is launched.<a id="GBS.0107.01"/> I need to get most of my life <em class="char-i">done</em>. I need to lock it down.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“But it comes undone. There are so many times in life when we think we have it locked down,” he says. We are quiet again.</p>
<p class="para-p">Plans are made. Plans come apart. New delights or tragedies pop up in their place. And nothing human or divine will map out this life, this life that has been more painful than I could have imagined. More beautiful<a id="GBS.0107.02"/> than I could have imagined.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Right. That’s the secret—don’t skip to the end,” I remind myself, sheepishly wiping my face on the sleeve of my sweater.</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp"><span class="char-first cso_10">M<span class="smallcaps">Y FRIEND </span>K<span class="smallcaps">ORI, DAYTIME </span></span>pastor and nighttime comedian, has bought a subscription to an online life-enrichment course for way too much money. It seemed like such a great idea—let’s get focused!—but now it sits unused in her iPhone downloads to<a id="GBS.0107.03"/> the tune of six hundred dollars.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Want to do my life-changing, goal-oriented online course with me?” asks Kori. She is the kind of person who owns her own portable photo booth with buckets of props so that every time she appears—<em class="char-i">poof</em>—it’s a party.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page162" title="162"/>
<p class="para-p">“But I am the worst at this stuff now! I can’t make plans, and, geez, my life is already too meaningful,” I protest.</p>
<p class="para-p">“But think of all the fun we’ll<a id="GBS.0107.04"/> have creating our time management diaries and logging our hours spent watching <em class="char-i">American Ninja Warrior</em>.” She’s right. We watch an Olympic amount of reality television. And at first the course assignments are not too bad. I give up a time-consuming game on my phone and agree to read more at night. But soon the daily tasks get down to the bones of my life, telling me to make concrete plans to improve<a id="GBS.0107.05"/> my health this year, and then make a plan for five years from now.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Five years?!” I text Kori. “I don’t know…I guess my big goal is NOT TO DIE.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“What about your horrible spinach drink?” she asks.</p>
<p class="para-p">“I can drink the horrible spinach drink.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Great! And take your vitamins!” she chirps.</p>
<p class="para-p">“The course keeps asking me to define my life philosophy and I’m not sure what to say. I want to communicate<a id="GBS.0108.01"/> in my actions and my words that I’m living but I’m aware of the reality of death.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Hmmmm…”</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page163" title="163"/>
<p class="para-p">“I think it’s something like ‘Living Well, Grieving Well,’ ” I say uncertainly.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Oh, absolutely not,” she said. “That all sounds very serious and proper when you say it like that.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Fine. ‘No Living Well, Grieving Well.’ ”</p>
<p class="para-p">“How about your motto should be ‘Balls Out Living. Balls Out Grieving’?” she<a id="GBS.0108.02"/> ventures.</p>
<p class="para-p">When she says it, I love her more. She never treats me as if I’m rearranging deck chairs on the <em class="char-i">Titanic,</em> or tacitly suggests I could save myself with my new juicing machine. She helps me walk the line between total passivity and supercharged heroic effort, but mostly she understands that the best thing she can do is order Canadian props for my patriotic Canadian Thanksgiving party and<a id="GBS.0108.03"/> pray for me like a champion.</p>
<p class="para-p">As we plug along with this life course, the assignments get harder.</p>
<p class="para-p">“What are the goals for your primary relationships?” it asks. “What qualities do you want to foster in them? What thing do you want them to know with all their hearts?”</p>
<p class="para-p">I write Toban’s and Zach’s names down on a blank sheet in my notebook and find myself circling their names with endless hearts.<a id="GBS.0108.04"/> How can I have goals for these relationships in a future that might never come? Exhausted, I stuff the notebook into the bottom of my bag.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page164" title="164"/>
<p class="para-p">But the questions are sticking to me. On long walks, in hospital waiting rooms, in moments before sleep. <em class="char-i">What do I want to give them?</em> I have taken the notebook back out and scribbled a couple of words.</p>
<p class="para-p"><em class="char-i">Compassion.</em></p>
<p class="para-p">That one is for Zach. I have always wanted<a id="GBS.0108.05"/> to raise a boy who loves the underdog, who stops for snails, who wants to know why the man outside the car window says he will work for food. I want to raise a tough softy. He will know the pain of the world but all will be better for it. He will be brave in the face of heartbreak.</p>
<p class="para-p">For Toban, I write a word and then I shake my head. It is impossible: <em class="char-i">joy</em>.</p>
<p class="para-p">How can I ask a man who might lose his<a id="GBS.0109.01"/> wife, the mother of his son, and his best friend since middle school to feel something close to joy? Sometimes we play a game called What Don’t I Know About You? and the answer is always so specific that no one else can play. I recently learned that he had played the bass clarinet in grade seven, and I shrieked: <em class="char-i">“How did I not know this? Who are you?”</em> I know everything. He knows everything. How<a id="GBS.0109.02"/> can anything good live in the space that death would make?</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page165" title="165"/>
<p class="para-p">As the question turns in my mind, my hand begins to scribble. The page is filling with words, ideas, little tidbits of something I wasn’t sure I knew how to do anymore. I am making plans. I am living in Ordinary Time.</p>
<p class="para-p">I can take care of Zach on a Saturday so Toban can take his dirt bike out on the back roads. I can buy him chocolates<a id="GBS.0109.03"/> at every weird stop where my research takes me and put them by his desk. I can lay his arm on my knee while we watch television and trace tickly lines from his wrist to his elbow. I can run my hands through his hair and tell him that he is growing more inappropriately beautiful year by year and remind him of the time that he looked identical to an advertisement for sunglasses. I can tell his family<a id="GBS.0109.04"/> and friends, quietly, that in case I don’t survive, I want them to know the greatest truth about us is that I need him to be happy, remake his life, marry if he likes, and, as soon as possible, surprise himself by how hard he can laugh.</p>
<p class="para-p">I buy him a huge sign that reads <span class="smallcaps char-sc">YOU ARE MY BUCKET LIST</span> and hang it in our living room.</p>
<p class="para-p">My little plans are crumbs scattered on the ground. This is all I have<a id="GBS.0109.05"/> learned about living here, plodding along, and finding God. My well-laid plans are no longer my foundation. I can only hope that my dreams, my actions, my hopes are leaving a trail for Zach and Toban, so, whichever way the path turns, all they will find is Love.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page166" title="166"/>
<p class="para-p">Zach is beside me in our big bed as I write these words, rolling around like a polar bear cub. After we take him out of his crib in<a id="GBS.0110.01"/> the morning he loves to come “up up” to our loft bedroom and loll around like only two-year-olds can. It’s another beautiful morning, and it’s time to yell with the pitch of the coffee grinder and make him French toast. I will die, yes, but not today.</p></div><div style="display:none;"><a id="GBS.0110.02"/></div></body></html>
