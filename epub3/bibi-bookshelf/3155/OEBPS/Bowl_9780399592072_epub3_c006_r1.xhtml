<p class="para-pf stickupcaps char-dropcap-DC cso_18-DC sans-dc" style="text-indent: 0;">T<span class="char-first cso_10"><span class="smallcaps">HE LONG DAWN OF </span>A<span class="smallcaps">DVENT </span></span>will soon begin, and now we are all learning to wait. Christmas is coming and the baby Jesus will be born, but for now we must sit in the darkness.</p>
<p class="para-p">I come from a Christmas home. I’m sure other people will say that they are Christmas enthusiasts, but—I say this with all sincerity—they are deceived. When I was growing up, we ate, breathed, and slept<a id="GBS.0063.02"/> December 25. If there was a song to sing, it was a Christmas carol. If there was an inflatable member of the nativity scene that could be added to our front yard, it was waving in the wind. And if there was a pause on a long car ride on a hot July afternoon, it was because my dad was trying to come up with another way to ask: “Who is your favorite wise man?” Years ago, my dad started writing<a id="GBS.0063.03"/> Christmas trivia quizzes for parties, and these grew into a number of historical books about Santa Claus and Christmas controversies, as well as a global encyclopedia of the holiday; these cost him ten years and roughly six hundred Christmas ornaments bought for “academic reasons.” There is nothing my family loves more than our white Canadian Christmases in our crappy bungalow surrounded by blow-up<a id="GBS.0063.04"/> Christmas figures that belong outside a car dealership.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page89" title="89"/>
<p class="para-p">This year I need Christmas, but not Christmas as usual. I need a miracle somewhat smaller than God becoming a baby and somewhat bigger than the promises of the Duke doctor who keeps using the word <em class="char-i">palliative</em>.</p>
<p class="para-p">Then at one of our appointments Dr. Palliative mentions that there are a few variables that might change the course of my treatment.<a id="GBS.0063.05"/> Ninety percent of people with advanced colon cancer will receive chemotherapy and get their limited chance at life beyond five years. But there are two other options: I might be among the 7 percent of people who have a disorder in which cancer cells multiply beyond control so quickly that there is no treatment at all. It is an automatic death sentence. Or I might be among the remaining 3 percent<a id="GBS.0064.01"/> who have a variation on that disorder that opens them up to possible new treatments. They’ll give me a call in a couple of weeks and let me know.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page90" title="90"/>
<p class="para-p">“So, I either <em class="char-i">maybe</em> live, die almost immediately, or have some kind of magic cancer that gets special treatments?” I ask.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Pretty much,” he says.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Okay,” I say. They have already drawn blood, and now I just have to wait for the results. As it turns<a id="GBS.0064.02"/> out, the results come back in a couple of days, but I am too preoccupied to check my voice mail like a normal person. I get the news a week later, sitting outside, wrapped in blankets, fiddling with my phone.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Hi, this is a call from the cancer clinic. We got your results back. The doctor said to tell you that you have the magic cancer, and that you’d know what that meant.” I freeze. And then<a id="GBS.0064.03"/> I play it again. And then one more time. I start to yell.</p>
<p class="para-p"><em class="char-i">“I have the magic cancer! I have the magic cancer!”</em></p>
<p class="para-p">Toban comes running out of the house, and I sink into his arms, crying. We are both trying to smile with that weary look of people overwhelmed by the prospect of hope.</p>
<p class="para-p">“I might have a chance,” I manage to say between sobs. “I might have a chance.” He hugs me tightly, resting his chin<a id="GBS.0064.04"/> on my head. And then he releases me to let me sing “Eye of the Tiger” and do a lot of punching the air, because it is in my nature to do so.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page91" title="91"/>
<p class="para-p">The magic cancer, as it turns out, is a complicated gene mismatch repair disorder that I only partially understand. It is my ticket into clinical trials testing drugs not yet on the market. There is a trial opening up in the next few weeks seven hours away<a id="GBS.0064.05"/> in Atlanta, at Emory University, and Dr. Now-Not-Saying-Palliative has sent my files there to start the application process. Before I can find out whether I’ll make it into the trial, however, I need to get my medical insurance to cover it.</p>
<p class="para-p">About an hour after I hear the news I begin to work the phones, slowly making my way through all the customer service representatives in the Emory and Duke<a id="GBS.0065.01"/> insurance systems. Each university has a chain of people accustomed to saying no or, as I am beginning to suspect, they are evil robots masquerading as humans programmed to decline your every reasonable request. I try everything. My premium insurance will not cover anything outside of the Duke hospital system. I’m too poor to pay for it myself, but I don’t qualify for charity care because I am not<a id="GBS.0065.02"/> American. No matter how I parse it, paying as I go until I can get new insurance in January, just two months away, will cost me upward of $100,000. I know because I have had them price out the treatment down to every needle and scan.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page92" title="92"/>
<p class="para-p">By midafternoon, there is no one left to call, and the trial is not going to consider me without promise of payment. Either I have to come up with an impossible<a id="GBS.0065.03"/> sum of money in the next few weeks or I will never get into the trial, and all my hopes built on magic cancer disappear into the ether. I slam down the phone at the end of the last call, blood boiling. I turn toward my parents. They have been staying with me since the surgery, trying to entertain Zach, keep the refrigerator full, and take me to my hospital visits.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Don’t worry,” says my dad,<a id="GBS.0065.04"/> putting down his book. “Your mother and I have $140,000 in liquid assets.” I will only find out later that my family have all appraised their homes and savings plans—every last one of them—to see what they can cobble together to save my life. My best shot at survival will bankrupt my family. But my father keeps that impassive face and neutral voice that he always uses when everything is splitting<a id="GBS.0065.05"/> at the seams. He has put his retirement and savings on the table to wager on a chance, any chance, for his daughter. But all I can see is cancer turning everyone upside down and shaking the pennies out of their pockets. Cancer wants to take it all.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page93" title="93"/>
<p class="para-p"><em class="char-i">“I am not a normal person!”</em> I yell. It’s a non sequitur. I don’t know what it means, but I flush with rage and embarrassment when I realize that I’m<a id="GBS.0066.01"/> shouting at the man who has spent most of his life working jobs beneath him to pay for my school, to buy my books, and to get me those juice boxes I like. I storm out of the house.</p>
<p class="para-p">I pace through the backyard in the cooling air, weighing the math. I can’t pay for this myself. Nothing plus nothing keeps equaling nothing.</p>
<p class="para-p">I sit down on a bench and curl my knees into my chest. I have a terrible<a id="GBS.0066.02"/> premonition that at the end of this—once every stone is upturned and every drug tried—my family will have nothing left. I feel like an anvil dropped, crushing everything on its way down. I know it like I know the weight of my son’s sleeping body in my arms. I will be the reason for the tall paper stacks of bills on the desk in the study, the second mortgage on my parents’ aging home, the slope of<a id="GBS.0066.03"/> their backs as they walk a little more heavily. They will carry my death in their checkbooks, vacations deferred, sleepless nights, and the silence of Sunday morning prayers when there is no daughter left to pray for. I am the death of their daughter. I am the death of his wife. I am the end of his mother. I am the life interrupted. Amen.</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page94" title="94"/>
<p class="para-sp"><span class="char-first cso_10">T<span class="smallcaps">HIS WILL BE MY </span></span>first Christmas away from Canada, away<a id="GBS.0066.04"/> from my church on the one night when all the wanderers who no longer attend return to hug one another and sing carols like only Mennonites can, in growly German and perfect four-part harmony. I have always loved the darkness and the candles during “Silent Night.” Mostly I love the feeling of homecoming I get when I see Liz, who designed my prom dress in a shiny lavender poly-satin, and Ferd, who<a id="GBS.0066.05"/> quietly nailed the cross back together after my friend and I accidentally broke it in an ill-advised reenactment of the crucifixion on a youth group overnight. I never told my parents and, God bless him, neither did Ferd. I look forward to getting a fierce hug from Charlotte, my mom’s best friend, and my old Sunday school teacher Carol, who helped me get into my sheep costume for the Christmas<a id="GBS.0067.01"/> pageant year after year.</p>
<p class="para-p">A couple of Christmases ago, I saw Carol over one of the pews and reached out to give her a hug, remembering only at the last second that she had recently been diagnosed with cancer. I couldn’t figure out what to say when we pulled away and I found I was just staring into her smiling face, stammering something about how sorry I was. She looked back at me with such calm<a id="GBS.0067.02"/> and said something I had never heard anyone say.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page95" title="95"/>
<p class="para-p">“I have known Christ in so many good times,” she said, sincerely and directly. “And now I will know Him better in His sufferings.”</p>
<p class="para-p">She meant it. And I could not imagine a world in which I could mean it. It was Christmas, and I was busy with presents, coffee dates, and rushing between family gatherings. It was only partway through the service that<a id="GBS.0067.03"/> I began to hope that that Christmas feeling would sink in as the night gathered and the music slowed. The angels were singing and the Wise Men were on their way and all the church was ready for Jesus to be born, but I hardly noticed. I wasn’t asking God for anything in particular. Carol surely wanted healing and more years with her husband and an escape from the creeping death that is multiplying<a id="GBS.0067.04"/> cells and the fading powers of chemotherapy drugs. And yet she prayed for more than to be saved. She prayed in the long night of Advent that her waiting would end with a better angle of vision on the baby born to die.</p>
<p class="para-p">Toban encouraged me to put up the Christmas tree in October, and we trimmed the house with toasted pinecones, bushy evergreen branches, and golden baubles. First thing in the morning,<a id="GBS.0067.05"/> Zach loves to sprint from his room, his chubby arms pumping, to make sure he is there when I flick on the lights to the tree. He laughs maniacally every time, tossing his head back with an evil “Ha! Ha! Ha!” like Vincent Price. I taught him how to do that, and I have never regretted it. Then he pulls a thick blanket over to where I am sitting and tucks us both into it. He looks up at me and<a id="GBS.0068.01"/> smiles broadly.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page96" title="96"/>
<p class="para-p"><em class="char-i">God, I don’t want to just know you better. I want to save my family.</em></p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp"><span class="char-first cso_10">S<span class="smallcaps">TILL SITTING ON THE </span></span>outdoor bench with my phone, I shoot off an email to the only two professors I know with some connections to the hospital. I tell them that I’ve been turned down by insurance, and that I am at the end of what I can do. My mind is circling around the same obsessive thought: <em class="char-i">I am ruining<a id="GBS.0068.02"/> everything for everyone I love.</em> Both professors write back immediately with just a few words. “I’m on it.” “Let me see what I can do.”</p>
<p class="para-p">The thing I love most about my friends is summed up by their reaction to my ridiculous request. Later, one of them will tell me exactly what he had said to himself: “Thank God! Something I can do!” Their love has arms and legs and momentum. Their love has reach.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page97" title="97"/><a id="GBS.0068.03"/>
<p class="para-p">As it turns out, they will shake the bushes for me. They will email everyone they know and, after my useless efforts to get anyone to even talk to me, I watch with equally helpless shock as the emails start to pour in, emails from famous people with Wikipedia pages and their names on buildings. These two professors pull the right levers and know whom to ask; they have pleaded for me at every level<a id="GBS.0068.04"/> of these institutions, and within twenty-four hours I have multiple assurances from what feels like the queen on down to the janitor that I will see only green lights from now on. My family will be spared; I might be saved. I have squeezed through the cracks in the system and found my way back into the sun even though, really, I have done nothing at all. It has all been done for me.</p>
<p class="para-p">The prosperity<a id="GBS.0068.05"/> gospel has a word for that feeling that God is on your side. It’s called “favor” in a very particular sense. When a man stands up in a church service to testify that his boss gave him the company car and free gas to go visit his ailing father, shouts of “Favor! Favor!” erupt from the congregation. When a woman tells a friend that her bid for a house she would like to buy has been accepted, despite<a id="GBS.0069.01"/> heavy competition, her friend whoops with a cry of “Favor!” The wind is at your back. It’s what insiders claim is the protection of God at every turn but outsiders might simply call luck. “I’m not a normal person,” one of them might say.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page98" title="98"/>
<p class="para-p">With the insurance obstacles clearing, the clinical trial folks ask me to come down for a preliminary screening or, as I start to call it, my tryout. They want<a id="GBS.0069.02"/> to take my blood, run some tests, and see if I qualify as a desirable candidate in their selective study. Now I am just worried that I might be disqualified because I am still bleeding from my surgery incisions. I am trying to keep that to myself, but at one point even I have to admit I am not doing terribly well, and Toban drives me to the emergency room late at night. A kindly doctor lets me<a id="GBS.0069.03"/> skip the hours-long wait and leads us into what amounts to a spare closet with a flickering fluorescent light, a single chair, and no supplies. He is doing me a favor, seeing me with no notice, and has to scrounge for what he needs before he asks me to lift my shirt and show him what we are dealing with. It’s gross because it is infected, and we all know it, but I am determined to make small talk<a id="GBS.0069.04"/> to show my appreciation for his efforts and not to make a peep about the treatment. The treatment, as it turns out, hurts so much that it makes my eyes water. It looks a lot like someone trying to squeeze wine out of grapes by hand and sounds a lot like MASH MASH MASH MASH MASH, which makes Toban gag as I am trying to look around pleasantly and comment on the state of world news. When the doctor steps<a id="GBS.0069.05"/> back, it looks like a murder scene. But for some reason, the whole thing is so funny to me that, once Toban stops retching into his cupped hands, I resolve to stow it away in the memory bank as “Fun in Retrospect.”</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page99" title="99"/>
<p class="para-p">My nerves are on edge on the morning of my departure. I wake up and pack the wounds as quietly as possible before I go downstairs to lift my tiny human out of his crib. I grind the<a id="GBS.0070.01"/> coffee beans while Zach and I yell at the top of our lungs to match the pitch of the grinder. We do it every day, and I’d like to think we’re getting better at it. I hate to leave him for these few days of testing, as everything still feels too precious and this love makes me clingy and tender. But my dad and I pack our things and say our goodbyes, promising that we will stop at every oversize landmark<a id="GBS.0070.02"/> and text everyone with any bit of news.</p>
<p class="para-p">Cancer clinics try to be places of encouragement, and for that we can offer them a slow hand clap. But mostly they are encounters with death set to the tune of a young volunteer on the lobby’s baby grand piano and the muffled sounds of someone yelling, <em class="char-i">“Mr. Smith! It’s your turn for blood work!”</em> When I heard a harp player in the foyer, I immediately turned<a id="GBS.0070.03"/> to my dad and said: “Is it really <em class="char-i">that</em> bad?”</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page100" title="100"/>
<p class="para-p">Pale and puffy, the patients lean their heads on the hard edges of the seats beside them or sink onto the bony shoulders of their companions. Everyone looks up when a name is called, momentarily revived. There are wheelchairs everywhere and bald, wrinkled women in bright kerchiefs and someone coughing blood beside a mural that reads: <span class="smallcaps char-sc">LAUGHTER IS THE<a id="GBS.0070.04"/> BEST MEDICINE</span>! Lord, I hope not.</p>
<p class="para-p">Everyone I meet is kind and efficient, and I try to accept what is happening like it’s my first day of work. The bruising needle marks will go away, I tell myself, and the scan was not so bad because I made Sam, the technician, tell me his life story. “Start at the beginning,” I said as he injected the dye. “Leave nothing out.” He took that so seriously that by<a id="GBS.0070.05"/> the time I had left the room, he had just been born.</p>
<p class="para-p">Then there is nothing left to do. The doctors will review the charts and let me know if I qualify. As we walk past the sign for the cancer clinic, I stop my dad and hand him my phone.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page101" title="101"/>
<p class="para-p">“Take a picture, Dad. When I get in the trial, people are going to want to see me in this moment.”</p>
<p class="para-p">I raise my clasped hands in the air in a gesture of salute<a id="GBS.0071.01"/> and plaster a huge smile on my face. It is getting colder out, even in Atlanta, and it occurs to me that it is autumn and I might not get another summer. I grit my teeth into a bigger smile. He takes a few pictures, and we walk to the car quietly before my dad breaks the silence to ask me something I love about Christmas. But I can already feel the shape of a question looming in my mind: <em class="char-i">Who takes<a id="GBS.0071.02"/> a picture of something she is begging God for?</em></p>
<p class="para-p">In the darkness of the car ride home to my family and the baby asleep in his bed, I can’t help but think about the person in the photo, who pretended she wasn’t on the edge of dying. Her cheerfulness. Her sunny-side-up Facebook posts brimming with positivity and gently ironic updates. Is that really me?</p>
<p class="para-p"><em class="char-i">“I am not a normal person!”</em> I had shouted,<a id="GBS.0071.03"/> to myself and to my father and to God. Even though I did not solve my own insurance debacle or create the biology to have “magic cancer,” I have still, somehow, clung to the idea that I am able to save myself. To my friends and family, I sugarcoat the truth with spiritual-sounding assurances and good cheer.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page102" title="102"/>
<p class="para-p">There is an inchoate sadness in the pit of my stomach, hard to express. I try to focus<a id="GBS.0071.04"/> on the more superficial things that are out of my control. I feel sick when I look at the crisscrossing scars on my stomach. I hate running my fingers through my hair because I can feel the light tearing of my scalp and see the little tufts of hair that come off in my hands. I walk past a gym and watch the women work out as if I’m an alien who crash-landed on a planet of the carefree and healthy.<a id="GBS.0071.05"/> I know I am going to be getting chemotherapy no matter what, but when it was announced that I would be wearing a giant sack filled with chemotherapy fluid in a bag around my waist, attached to a giant needle that goes into the port beside my heart, I am just <em class="char-i">thrilled</em> to be bringing fanny packs back into style. And since I always need to wear my backpack to carry my medical equipment, I am essentially<a id="GBS.0072.01"/> wearing bags on bags on bags.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Some women BeDazzle it,” says an older nurse, helpfully.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Yes, this certainly needs a heck of a lot more rhinestones,” I say, looking it over. “Something that says ‘<span class="smallcaps char-sc">BLESSED</span>!’…or something.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Or something,” says the nurse, and we silently agreed that it is hideous in all its forms.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page103" title="103"/>
<p class="para-p">When I started chemotherapy, I tried to hide all its varieties of ugliness. I posted<a id="GBS.0072.02"/> pretty self-portraits on Facebook and named my portable chemo pack Jimmy after I saw former president Jimmy Carter at the cancer center twice and announced to everyone that we would develop a lifelong friendship. Everyone knew that Kate had cancer and that for her it was basically a special pass to understand the life and times of Jimmy Carter. People had something to ask about and to point<a id="GBS.0072.03"/> to that was sweet and funny. No one had to lead with “Soooo…you have cancer.” Instead, it was always “So, how’s Jimmy?” I couldn’t stand that people might see through me—that they might know I was only another tired cancer patient with a creeping sense of hopelessness and the glorious delusion that sheer willpower would make the difference.</p>
<p class="para-p">In the storefront prosperity church I studied for years,<a id="GBS.0072.04"/> the congregation managed the spectacle of pain with ceaseless positivity. A singer’s congested voice can’t hit the high notes, and other women begin to shout encouragement. A woman slumps into her seat, and the people around her start to sing about how far she’s come, to the tune of “Look What the Lord Has Done.” An elder once preached his Sunday school message on this determined joy by imitating<a id="GBS.0072.05"/> a limping man still shouting with delight that he was already healed. He could limp his way, by utter determination, into God’s favor.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page104" title="104"/>
<p class="para-p">When I think about where sheer grit has gotten me, I can’t help but remember standing in the parking lot outside my pregnancy education class, seven months pregnant, having a panic attack. Somehow the reality of my already massive baby making a massive exit sent<a id="GBS.0073.01"/> me completely over the edge, and I ran out of the room, trying not to lose it in front of a gaggle of overly fashionable soon-to-be moms. But then Toban gave me the greatest speech ever given, which, looking back, I realize sounded a lot like the battle cry from Shakespeare’s <em class="char-i">Henry V</em> (“We few! We happy few!”) but ended with <em class="char-i">“Look at them!”</em> (He pointed dramatically through the window at the women<a id="GBS.0073.02"/> taking the class.) “Do any of <em class="char-i">them</em> look like they can crank out an enormous baby? <em class="char-i">Those</em> little wimps? One lady just asked for filtered water, Kate. <em class="char-i">Filtered water!</em>” I started to laugh, which meant I had started to breathe again. “You are going to go. back. in. there. and learn how to <em class="char-i">have. this. baby</em>!” And then we marched back in there with Toban quietly percussing the theme song to <em class="char-i">Chariots of<a id="GBS.0073.03"/> Fire</em>.</p>
<p class="para-p">I have been all kinds of cheery. But positivity has become a burden. And it’s a burden I assumed when I decided that, in the darkness of Advent, I would save myself.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page105" title="105"/>
<p class="para-p">At the end of the week I get a phone call from Emory saying that I have qualified for the study. My parents shout and dance, and Toban picks Zach up and twirls him around like a carousel horse.</p>
<p class="para-p">“See?” I say to my dad. “I’m<a id="GBS.0073.04"/> not a normal person.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“No,” he says softly, reaching out to pull me to him. “You’re a superhero. But I wish you didn’t have to be.”</p></div><div style="display:none;"><a id="GBS.0073.05"/></div></body></html>
