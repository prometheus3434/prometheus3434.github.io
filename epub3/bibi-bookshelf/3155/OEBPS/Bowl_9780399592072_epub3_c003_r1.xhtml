<h1 class="para-cn-chap-pg sans">CHAPTER 3</h1>
<h1 class="para-ct">Magic Tricks</h1>
<p class="para-pf stickupcaps char-dropcap-DC cso_18-DC sans-dc" style="text-indent: 0;">M<span class="char-first cso_10"><span class="smallcaps">Y FRIEND </span>B<span class="smallcaps">LAIR ONCE INVITED </span></span>me to a “Magical Extravaganza” at the local performing arts center. When we arrived, two facts became immediately apparent: The first was that it was almost impossible to see any of the actual magic tricks from the second balcony. They looked like a blur of gloved-hand gestures coupled with music that suggested we were missing a lot of mesmerizing<a id="GBS.0027.02"/> eye contact. The other was that magic shows need something approximating magic. In the opening act, a tent rose from the stage surrounded by a flutter of dancers. They twirled and waved their arms toward center stage for what felt like forever, but as the music crescendoed and the dancers in their final poses began to tremble, we realized that something had gone very wrong. Some kind of hidden<a id="GBS.0027.03"/> trap had clearly malfunctioned, preventing the magicians from appearing suddenly, before our very eyes. Instead, nothing happened. Nothing except that the curtain descended to the muffled sound of two women laugh-crying into their sleeves from the second balcony.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page30" title="30"/>
<p class="para-p">But I have seen a different kind of magic up close. I have seen parents of an autistic child buy special earphones promised to “clear<a id="GBS.0027.04"/> out” his ear canals and let him finally understand their adoring reassurances. I have heard accounts of parents buying their dying child a pair of shoes so that he or she might get up and walk. I have browsed through advertisements from preachers who mail out wallets with the promise that they will multiply the bills inside. I thought of them all as I handed forty dollars to my chiropractor for<a id="GBS.0027.05"/> the special magnets that were supposed to restore strength to my arms, and then a little more money for the detoxifying footbath that was meant to pull the impurities out of my contaminated body. At some point, I started to wear a special bracelet my friend gave me that had been advertised as a conduit for positive ions, or something scientific sounding, which I wore because it made both of us feel<a id="GBS.0028.01"/> better. I was trying everything and caring less about whether it made any sense. I just needed it to <em class="char-i">work</em>.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page31" title="31"/>
<p class="para-p">In the study of religion, we use the word <em class="char-i">magic</em> sparingly because, so often, it is employed as a cheap way of describing faiths whose supernatural forces we simply don’t credit. No, that dance did not make it rain. No, that buried statue in the yard did not help you sell the house. No, that<a id="GBS.0028.02"/> special prayer did not heal your leg. The causality seems simultaneously too direct (this action yields this exact result) and too vague, like you’re pulling on a thread with nothing at the end.</p>
<p class="para-p">By then the hundred or so times that I’d sat across from a doctor, with a pen in hand and an exasperated expression, had become a blur. All I wanted was a name for what I had, a shorthand for why I still<a id="GBS.0028.03"/> found myself unable to type, chop vegetables for dinner, or at least fake a cartwheel on the beach. My goodness, I was beginning to feel like an insecure girlfriend: <em class="char-i">Just tell me what’s wrong with me. Is it me? It’s me, isn’t it?</em></p>
<p class="para-p">I was a month away from getting surgery to remove two of my ribs when I got a recommendation from a childhood friend who knew me when I was a cellist. Over the years<a id="GBS.0028.04"/> I had seen a lot of great musicians suffer from different kinds of arm pain, and backstage the unmistakable smell of Tiger Balm always lingered in the air. My friend is a drummer, and he mentioned that there were distinctive schools of physical therapy designed for musicians and dancers to address their particular injuries. Within a few hours I had found the name of a local physical therapist who<a id="GBS.0028.05"/> seemed to know something about what was happening to me.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page32" title="32"/>
<p class="para-p">Our first meeting was a barrage of humiliations. She looked me up and down, her head shaking no, and asked me to walk for her. Touch the wall and come back. I touched the wall and came back.</p>
<p class="para-p">“You walk like a gorilla,” she said to me on my return. “No, seriously. Knuckles forward. Slightly hunched. That’s all gorilla.”</p>
<p class="para-p">I laughed. I am<a id="GBS.0029.01"/> an exceedingly loud eater and a consummate mouth breather, so this really completed the picture.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Now lie on this bench and breathe into this blue balloon,” she said abruptly, not because she was socially awkward but because there were a <em class="char-i">lot</em> of completely random things she needed me to do. After I was done breathing into a balloon, she taught me a lot of weird reaching exercises, tested my vision<a id="GBS.0029.02"/> through various geriatric lenses, and manually “reset” my ribs because “ribs are like the chassis of a car.”</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page33" title="33"/>
<p class="para-p">It was, by far, the weirdest appointment I had ever had, but, even so, I heard myself saying: “Do you think you can fix me?”</p>
<p class="para-p">And I believed her when she replied, in no uncertain terms: “Yes.”</p>
<p class="para-p">She diagnosed my problem easily. I had been born with overly loose joints and, with all the<a id="GBS.0029.03"/> sitting and typing for my dissertation, my natural asymmetry had become especially exaggerated. My body responded to this assault by seizing up around my joints, trapping nerves, and shutting down my arms. Even though she called me a gorilla, this was the woman who restored the use of my arms with a little-known school of bodywork called Postural Restoration. <em class="char-i">Presto!</em> Just like that, a dark chapter<a id="GBS.0029.04"/> of my life closed.</p>
<p class="para-p">It was the beginning of a series of gains for me, ladders that were my escape out of the Nowhere I’d been living. I landed my dream job at a major university seminary teaching the big survey of American religion to do-gooders of all kinds. I secured a contract for my first book. The publisher even let me do my own reading for the audiobook version. This is despite the fact<a id="GBS.0029.05"/> that, five minutes into the recording, the sound technician piped his voice into the sound booth where I was sitting, marveling at my own prose.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page34" title="34"/>
<p class="para-p">“Is it all…um…going to be like this?” he asked, knowing that we had weeks together of recording each chapter.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Yes?” I replied, realizing too slowly that he wasn’t offering me a compliment.</p>
<p class="para-p">Despite being aggressively boring, I was doing splendidly.<a id="GBS.0030.01"/> Things were, in fact, going so well that the members of the storefront prosperity church I was studying started to take notice. Two of my favorite churchwomen raised it with me.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Well, my dear, things are going really well. <em class="char-i">And</em> you’re hearing these great faith messages,” she said, raising one eyebrow to evoke an answer. Her name is Linda, and not only is she the most devoted woman of prayer I<a id="GBS.0030.02"/> know, but she always smells like sweet cedarwood when she wraps me in a hug.</p>
<p class="para-p">“It works, honey,” said Valerie, a polished businesswoman and an endlessly patient answerer of questions about all things prosperity. “It really works! Just look at yourself!”</p>
<p class="para-p">I broke into a wide smile. I was studying the prosperity gospel, but that day I <em class="char-i">was</em> the prosperity gospel. I had become living proof, at last.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page35" title="35"/><a id="GBS.0030.03"/>
<p class="para-p">We have words to evaluate how likely it is that our attempts to harness the supernatural are of any use. Black cats and ladders and spilling the salt are put in a box dubbed superstition, and failed prophecies are classified as fantasies or delusions. But the prosperity gospel asks you to set aside your doubts and bet it all on God’s supernatural power to reach down and remake the world according<a id="GBS.0030.04"/> to your prayer. When everything in your body says believe, believe, believe. When you find yourself turning to your neighbor and saying: “You can’t imagine what I just saw.” You are not just an observer anymore, you are a witness. So then the question is always, Will it work?</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp"><span class="char-first cso_10">A<span class="smallcaps"> PROSPERITY-MINDED FRIEND OF </span></span>mine once had a loved one die so young that he couldn’t conceive of it, this flowering<a id="GBS.0030.05"/> life snipped off at the stem. He and this friend had recently been teenagers together. One day they’d been running shoulder to shoulder down a dirt road talking about their next lacrosse game, and the next his parents were choosing among glossy woods for a coffin that would keep him in the ground. And so my friend called in all those closest and dearest to gather around the boy’s coffin before burial<a id="GBS.0031.01"/> and pray. They prayed all night, all day, and then the next, forgetting to eat or to sleep, buoyed by a confidence that he would be resurrected.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page36" title="36"/>
<p class="para-p">“We just couldn’t believe that God wouldn’t resurrect him,” he told me, shaking his head in exhaustion. “We couldn’t believe it. We were so certain that it couldn’t be the end.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Only magic, only a miracle, could start their friend’s heart. And as the<a id="GBS.0031.02"/> hours passed in prayer, their furious love dissolved into fury at the God who’d left him cold. Didn’t Jesus bring Lazarus back from the grave? Couldn’t God do the same with the chilling body of a well-loved boy?</p>
<p class="para-p">They longed for a moment of suspended reality, their Lazarus moment. The worst would be undone in the span of a prayer, their dying dreams for this boy snapping back to life. <em class="char-i">For you,<a id="GBS.0031.03"/> God, wouldn’t it be so easy? </em>They would see the young man’s face pinking and his hand reaching out for theirs. They would hear his voice calling through the satin and wood, asking them to help him up again, and they would slap him on the back with the gentle violence of men awkwardly trying to express their love.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page37" title="37"/>
<p class="para-p">“You had us scared there for a minute, buddy. We thought we’d lost you,” they would<a id="GBS.0031.04"/> say, tears spilling over their cheeks. And he might reply, hugging them a little longer than he should: “I don’t know what you did, but I’m so glad it worked.”</p></div><div style="display:none;"><a id="GBS.0031.05"/></div></body></html>
