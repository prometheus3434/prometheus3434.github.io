Not poor like sweet church mice. Poor like people who worried we would get scurvy because we couldn’t afford to buy oranges and then got in the habit of talking about it using pirate voices. For a long time we lived in a one-room apartment that the landlord<a id="GBS.0032.02"/> generously called an “efficiency.” Toban and I could reach into the kitchen from the living room couch, which was also the bed. And the desk. We would sit on our couch-bed-desk and watch late-night televangelism and movies we found in the student center and plan our next five-dollar date. We didn’t mind deferring our dreams for a while, but then the demands of school and a twenty-thousand-dollar<a id="GBS.0032.03"/> annual income started to make those decisions for us. We got in the habit of putting our child-rearing plans on hold for another day, a day when we would have a little house with a baby room and a decent cable package instead of an antenna. But by the time we could afford our own bungalow, we realized that getting pregnant was going to be harder than we imagined. A year went by. And then another,<a id="GBS.0032.04"/> and we thought it might be too late.</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page39" title="39"/>
<p class="para-sp"><span class="char-first cso_10">I<span class="smallcaps"> MADE AN APPOINTMENT </span></span>for us to meet with a fertility doctor, and immediately resented every bit of paperwork leading up to our first appointment. I would read the question aloud to Toban and then exclaim: “This is none of their business!”</p>
<p class="para-p">“It is literally their business,” he replied.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Well…it <em class="char-i">shouldn’t</em> be,” I huffed. I tried to resign myself to the indecency<a id="GBS.0032.05"/> of it all, and I missed feeling like there were details of my life that medicine’s expert ears would not hear. But I could not afford any privacy. We went to the doctor and it was as I had expected: poking and prodding and waiting.</p>
<p class="para-p">After a few appointments, Toban and I were dawdling in the car outside the fertility center one day, counting babies.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page40" title="40"/>
<p class="para-p">“I see absolutely <em class="char-i">zero</em> babies,” I said after<a id="GBS.0033.01"/> counting the first dozen or so women going in and out. “This must be a terrible repository for babies.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“It’s not a repository for babies,” Toban said, laughing. “This is for potentially <em class="char-i">making</em> babies. In the least sexy way possible.”</p>
<p class="para-p">I looked down at our hands, entwined on my knee.</p>
<p class="para-p">Our doctor, Dr. Gandhi, was exhaustingly clinical, but as he started to rattle off our treatment options, he<a id="GBS.0033.02"/> reminded me of my high school friend Ankita’s dad, who used to look down at us through his spectacles and quiz us about trouble we might be up to as if it were 1965.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Have you been joyriding, girls? Have you been necking with boys at the drive-in pictures?” The trick was to look at his glasses and not in his eyes so you didn’t burst out laughing.</p>
<p class="para-p">Dr. Gandhi was looking at me, a little disappointed,<a id="GBS.0033.03"/> but I wasn’t sure why. I didn’t think the charts he gave us were particularly definitive about the problem, and the solutions were a hazy mix of needles and pills and indefinite periods of waiting. He recommended delaying any treatment and suggested that we keep an eye on hormone levels for a few months to further diagnose the problem. But the waiting was pulling me down and backward into<a id="GBS.0033.04"/> those feelings, familiar from months of trying to solve the mystery of my arms, of exhausted unknowing. I was already tired of doctors. I was tired of waiting, I was tired of keeping my dreams on a tight leash.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page41" title="41"/>
<p class="para-p">For the next few months I managed the disappointment of no result with prayer and cookie dough and long periods of lying silently in the crook of Toban’s arm. He’d wrap his arms around<a id="GBS.0033.05"/> me and we’d stare at the botched drywall experiment that became the ceiling in the bungalow we rebuilt with our love and our religious determination that all construction work should be done by family members.</p>
<p class="para-p">I had never noticed how much prosperity churches talk about waiting until I began this long season of maternal deferment. I had never noticed how many women were pushing strollers and jostling<a id="GBS.0034.01"/> babies with smooshy cheeks until I had to regularly stand up and sing a Sunday favorite by Juanita Bynum:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="para-extvf fb_2em">I don’t mind waiting,</p>
<p class="para-extv fb_2em">I don’t mind wa-it-ing.</p>
<p class="para-extvl fb_2em">I don’t mind waiting, on You, Lord.</p></blockquote><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page42" title="42"/>
<p class="para-pcon">She draws out the word like she has forever to wait, forever to sit with a merciful God, forever to hear God finally say: <em class="char-i">It’s time. It’s time.</em></p>
<p class="para-p">Waiting is the language of Ecclesiastes: “To everything there<a id="GBS.0034.02"/> is a season and a time to every purpose under heaven.” Except that the prosperity gospel usually makes believers into farmers with “seed faith” sown in the ground, sitting in church, waiting for the rain and the harvest.</p>
<p class="para-p">One Sunday I watched a woman grow so impatient that she called down the rain. It was the First Lady of the little prosperity church I studied, a slight woman who always sat in<a id="GBS.0034.03"/> the front row, impassively fanning herself as her husband stirred up a fiery sermon. Then, one Sunday, she suddenly stood up and turned toward the congregation.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Our faith requires action!” she declared with surprising strength. “We must see disease, poverty, and unanswered prayers for what they are—Satan’s work. Now stand up! Stand up!” The small room shuffled to stand up, murmuring with excitement.</p><a id="GBS.0034.04"/>
<p class="para-p">“Now, after I say, ‘Money, cometh unto me,’ you call out to God for what you are entitled to. God’s blessings are already poured out for you. Now you must claim them. Claim them! Are you ready?”</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page43" title="43"/>
<p class="para-p">“Yes!”</p>
<p class="para-p"><em class="char-i">“Money!”</em> she shouted. “Now say it with me! <em class="char-i">Money!</em> Cometh unto me…<em class="char-i">now</em>!” And with that, the First Lady began to dance. She kicked her high heels under a chair and bounced in place, reaching her<a id="GBS.0034.05"/> arms higher and higher as she plucked invisible dollar bills from the sky. The room erupted into dance as some eighty believers, young and old, shook off their nerves and slowly joined her. It started as a murmur, as people began to speak their true hearts, and grew as their legs pumped in place and people began to shout.</p>
<p class="para-p">“A car!”</p>
<p class="para-p">“The green house.”</p>
<p class="para-p">They reached out for blessings visible only<a id="GBS.0035.01"/> to them. Young mothers jostled their babies as they jumped, while elderly women waved their arms to catch what fell. Tears streamed down people’s faces as they dug up their deepest desires and the losses they hoped to replace.</p>
<p class="para-p">A husband and wife who had lost all of their children simply clutched each other with one arm each and with the other reached up to the sky.</p>
<p class="para-p">“A baby,” I said quietly,<a id="GBS.0035.02"/> as the shouting faded and people slumped back into their seats, exhausted. A baby.</p>

<p class="para-sp"><span class="char-first cso_10">I<span class="smallcaps">N THIS SEASON OF </span></span>endless postponement, Chelsea and I were so happy for other people that we were exhausted. We were so happy for Amanda that her husband made so. much. money. in whiskey sales that she could stay at home or find the most flattering angle for her selfies whenever she was sunning herself on tropical<a id="GBS.0035.03"/> vacations. We were thrilled for Joanna that her family planning went off without a hitch and she gave birth to little Cade on exactly the day she wanted. We couldn’t get enough of hearing Christine talk about the pounds flying off as she really put her mind to it. “Self-discipline, girls,” she said, and we sucked our stomachs in a little more.</p>
<p class="para-p">In fact, we were getting so good at being happy for<a id="GBS.0035.04"/> people that we started to develop a special tone of voice, which sounded a little like a Valley Girl on helium, for people who couldn’t stop telling us how easily they had found their place in the sun. Whenever I found myself saying something like “And then you went backstage with the band <em class="char-i">again</em>?” I reminded myself to pull out the statement “I’m sooooooooo happy for you.” It was deliciously insincere,<a id="GBS.0035.05"/> but only Chelsea knew that, and it was a balm to my soul. I was surrounded by the world’s luckiest people in a culture that doesn’t believe in luck.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page45" title="45"/>
<p class="para-p">Oprah Winfrey is a one-woman crusade against “luck.” “Nothing about my life is lucky,” she has argued. “Nothing. A lot of grace, a lot of blessings, a lot of divine order, but I don’t believe in luck. For me, luck is preparation meeting the moment<a id="GBS.0036.01"/> of opportunity.” Luck implies that there might have been a moment when, God forbid, good fortune might have gone next door. Luck might mean we cannot say, unbowed, with the poet William Ernest Henley: “I am the master of my fate. / I am the captain of my soul.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Nothing in me wanted to take anything away from the people I loved. But I was becoming more and more like Solomon in Ecclesiastes, pulling<a id="GBS.0036.02"/> at dark threads. There is a time to get, and a time to lose. A time to rend, and a time to sew. But at baby showers and dinners for job promotions, I listened to the tradition anew. There is a time to speak and a time to shut your piehole.</p>

<p class="para-sp-alt"><span class="char-first cso_10">I<span class="smallcaps"> BELIEVED IN MAGIC ONCE.</span></span></p>
<p class="para-p">I was playing bingo with my friends in the monstrous bingo hall of an equally monstrous casino, its tall domes studded with artificial<a id="GBS.0036.03"/> lights, making night and day indistinguishable. There were hundreds of players in little terraces that spread down to the floor, where a man plucked numbered balls out of what looked like a giant popcorn machine. My friends and I were high rollers, each armed with a pink dabber to blot out the numbers and a three-dollar bingo card on which a single person could play not one but six whole<a id="GBS.0036.04"/> games.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page46" title="46"/>
<p class="para-p">We played the first game, then the second, slowly gaining confidence in the pace and the rules. The winner of the first game was the first person to play a horizontal line. The winner of the second game was the first one to fill the square around the central numbers. And so on. But then the grand finale—blackout. The first person to blot out the entire card would win thirteen hundred dollars,<a id="GBS.0036.05"/> the biggest cash prize of the night.</p>
<p class="para-p">I was roughly three numbers away from winning when I began silently to pray a completely absurd prayer.</p>
<p class="para-p"><em class="char-i">Dear Jesus,</em> I thought, totally embarrassed. <em class="char-i">I know you don’t normally do this kind of thing, and that it would be dumb if you did. But we are really broke right now and I would love to win that money. So, if you wouldn’t mind, could you help me win at…</em></p>
<p class="para-p"><em class="char-i"><a id="GBS.0037.01"/>“Bingo!”</em></p>
<p class="para-p">I shouted it so loudly that I startled the woman next to me.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page47" title="47"/>
<p class="para-p"><em class="char-i">“Bingo!”</em> I yelled again, but then, seeing everyone’s heads slowly turn toward me, I had a moment of doubt. <em class="char-i">“But I could be wrong!”</em></p>
<p class="para-p">But I was right. The officiant came over with great fanfare, carrying hundred-dollar bills that he arranged in a flat pyramid in front of me and my friends, who cried with laughter after I recounted<a id="GBS.0037.02"/> my prayer. I had prayed to God like He was a candy dispenser, and it had worked. We were converted.</p>
<p class="para-p">I used the same words a few months later when I was locked in the bathroom holding a pregnancy test. I still hadn’t had any fertility treatments, but even so, my body seemed to be working. I took one, two, then three positive pregnancy tests. Then I shouted through the door, unable to look at Toban<a id="GBS.0037.03"/> and see the expectation in his eyes.</p>
<p class="para-p"><em class="char-i">“I’m pregnant!”</em> I yelled, trying to keep my voice as flat as possible.</p>
<p class="para-p">Silence.</p>
<p class="para-p"><em class="char-i">“But I could be wrong!”</em> I could hear him laughing through the door.</p>
<p class="para-p">“How can you be wrong, hon? Are those tests not very accurate?” he asked reasonably. “And what are you still doing in there?”</p>
<p class="para-p">I was lying on the floor, effectively barricading myself in with my feet against<a id="GBS.0037.04"/> the door. I couldn’t face it. I couldn’t face him. I felt like the moment I saw him everything would be real. Thank God the phone was in there with me. I dialed Chelsea’s number, choked up by the impossible news. If magic was about formulas and saying the right words, I knew this wasn’t magic. It was something else.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page48" title="48"/>
<p class="para-p">“Chelsea, you wouldn’t believe it, but I think I finally got lucky.”</p>
<p class="para-p">I thought<a id="GBS.0037.05"/> about what I had said a second too late. And we laughed so hard we had to put our phones down for a minute to retie our ponytails.</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp"><span class="char-first cso_10">M<span class="smallcaps">Y BODY, AS IT </span></span>turned out, was not nearly as eager to bear a child as my mind was. Pregnancy hormones were loosening me up at every joint, already lax from the same condition that had caused me to feel heaviness and numbness in my arms. I was a jellyfish. As the<a id="GBS.0038.01"/> pregnancy progressed and my hips softened, my belly hung off my ligaments like lead. The baby was safe and snug, but it was, literally, pulling me apart.</p>
<p class="para-p">Week by week, I spent more and more time in the bathtub, floating. I slowly hoisted myself out of bed in the morning and taught classes to divinity school students all day. I teetered on my shoes in the morning, and by midday, I plopped myself<a id="GBS.0038.02"/> on a table or a chair and taught almost face-to-face with the class. I tried to be relatable and fun, but mostly I tried to pretend that pregnancy was an uncomplicated blessing.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page49" title="49"/>
<p class="para-p">It was a healthy pregnancy by every standard except that I wanted to put myself in a light coma until sometime after the baby was born. <em class="char-i">Please, anyone, surprise me with a baseball bat to the head.</em> The pain was a dull<a id="GBS.0038.03"/> roar. At a faculty dinner, I looked up and realized that someone had been talking to me for quite a while.</p>
<p class="para-p">“I’m so sorry,” I said, blushing. “This baby is just so…loud.”</p>
<p class="para-p">People kept telling me, “Oh, you wait until the baby is born! <em class="char-i">Then</em> you’ll see how hard it is,” and I wish now they could have seen the look on my face when I finally went into labor. Deep into the rhythm of arduous contractions,<a id="GBS.0038.04"/> I found myself smiling.</p>
<p class="para-p">“This is nice,” I panted to my sister-in-law over the phone. “Seriously, this feels so much better.”</p>
<p class="para-p">When we arrived at the hospital, a day into hard labor that wouldn’t progress, the doctor looked me up and down and suggested that we return home again.</p>
<p class="para-p">“You don’t have the look of someone in labor,” she said matter-of-factly.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page50" title="50"/>
<p class="para-p">“Yeah, well, you’re going to want to check<a id="GBS.0038.05"/> me. I am, unfortunately, amazing at being miserable.”</p>
<p class="para-p">I had one of those deliveries that mothers shouldn’t talk about because the world would, in an instant, stop having children altogether. All I will say is that labor lasted thirty-seven hours, and at many points, it was without the soothing comforts of modern medicine. But when the baby continued to go into distress, his heartbeat fluttering<a id="GBS.0039.01"/> on the beeping monitor, the doctors decided it was time for a C-section, and many hours after they made that call, he was pulled from my body and placed into my arms.</p>
<p class="para-p">As someone who has never had overly mushy feelings about babies, I have to say it was the most bizarre feeling I had ever had. It felt like something had pushed the reset button and my life had only begun. I should have asked for<a id="GBS.0039.02"/> a birth certificate for myself.</p>
<p class="para-p">What followed was a blissful year. That is the most annoying thing in the world to say, in a world full of mothers who struggle with breast-feeding, high fevers, long days, and late nights. But I can only try to redeem myself by saying that I was completely caught off guard by my outrageous happiness. I had a Zach. And a Zach suited me perfectly. He smelled like<a id="GBS.0039.03"/> vanilla extract and cookies almost all the time, and when he didn’t I sat him on a puffy waterproof cushion shaped like a frog in warm water in our farmhouse sink.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page51" title="51"/>
<p class="para-p">Baby Zach looked a lot like a guppy staring at me with wide, expressive eyes. He was hard to feed. Hard to entertain. Hard to put down to bed. Every time he wanted to relax, he demanded a brain-stem-loosening jiggle of his whole body<a id="GBS.0039.04"/> up and down, up and down in order to chill out for a moment and close his eyes. Some of the photos I circulated of Zach made him look like a wizened librarian with a comb-over, his thick cardigan pulled up around his neck, but I looked at him with the delusional love of a mother who knew he was going to be beautiful. And he was.</p>
<p class="para-p">My first book, on the prosperity gospel—my other baby—had come out<a id="GBS.0039.05"/> only months before Zach was born, so I spent this time in that sweet postbook haze that scholars love so much. The book is out in the world, looking important and busy, while you are at home in your pajamas eating pizza. I was wrapped in a cocoon of my husband’s love, my son’s squawking, and the glorious façade of efficiency.</p>
<p class="para-p">On my thirty-fourth birthday I could finally admit it to myself. I<a id="GBS.0040.01"/> sent a thank-you to all my family and friends with a little picture of Zach, perched on his little frog in the sink, his hair sprouting up from his head like an antenna. It read:</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page52" title="52"/>
<p class="para-p"><em class="char-i">Contrary to reports that 33 (The Jesus Year) must end badly, this was officially the best year of my life. And if anyone is a notary, we can make it official. Thanks for supporting me until I got to this, my own little<a id="GBS.0040.02"/> prosperity gospel.</em></p>
<p class="para-p">My 150-person American Christianity class caught wind of the note and sent me a giant gift basket filled with onesies and T-shirts for Zach plastered with enormous lettering that said it all: <span class="smallcaps char-sc">BLESSED</span>.</p></div><div style="display:none;"><a id="GBS.0040.03"/></div></body></html>
