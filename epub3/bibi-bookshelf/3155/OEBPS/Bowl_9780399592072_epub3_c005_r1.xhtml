I am counting up my time and realizing that it will not be enough, and I long for that God of Yes. I keep thinking, <em class="char-i">I am thirty-five. I am thirty-five. I will not live out the year, and this time will not be enough. It will not be sufficient to raise<a id="GBS.0041.02"/> a little baby to adulthood. It will not be the life that I promised to my husband. It is a poor imitation of the future I had planned. Lord, take this cancer away. Save me. Let me be a wife and mom and professor who loves you and lives to tell of your glory.</em> I am bargaining. I am trying to find the magic formula that lifts me out of this sterile room and back, back to the warmth of my own bed<a id="GBS.0041.03"/> and the sound of Zach babbling over the baby monitor about Mama and tractors. But mostly tractors. <em class="char-i">God, let me stay the mom of a boy who loves tractors.</em></p>

<p class="para-sp"><span class="char-first cso_10">E<span class="smallcaps">VERYTHING FEELS STRANGE AND </span></span>slow. On pain medication and without clocks, I can’t say for sure if it is still the same day as my diagnosis, the day of my surgery, or if they are one and the same. The first indication I have that it has been<a id="GBS.0041.04"/> two days since my diagnosis is that the church is keeping vigil. This will turn out to be one of the great advantages of working at Duke Divinity School—all my friends are pastors. My colleagues teach pastors, my friends are pastors, and my students are going to be pastors. There is a flood of pastors not only in my room but in the nearby waiting room and in the divinity school’s own chapel, where<a id="GBS.0041.05"/> the community had decided to come together and pray me through my surgery. They gathered in the warm wood sanctuary and sang hymns and read Scripture and prayed thick, layered prayers in a way that only desperate people can. When the main service ended, they came to the hospital and traded off like relay runners, each praying for me until relieved. Some are close friends and some are acquaintances,<a id="GBS.0042.01"/> and most are much, much smarter than I am. So it pleases me to no end to find out later that the most serious scholars I have ever known—authors of weighty books and owners of many velvet smoking jackets—have cried snotty tears as they pleaded with God to extend my life. They are teaching me the first lesson of my new cancer life—the first thing to go is pride.</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page55" title="55"/>
<p class="para-sp"><span class="char-first cso_10">T<span class="smallcaps">HE MOMENTS BEFORE </span>I<span class="smallcaps"> </span></span>go into<a id="GBS.0042.02"/> surgery are, comedically speaking, always a real high point for me. Over the course of my life, some of my best material has been in those pre-operating-table moments, when nurses are clucking around me and a hotshot doctor is giving instructions. Before my wisdom teeth were removed, with a few drugs—okay, a lot of drugs—I grabbed someone by the collar and told them to keep the teeth. I was making<a id="GBS.0042.03"/> a necklace for Toban. Before my emergency appendix removal, I had some solid remarks about minimizing scars for the swimsuit portion of the Miss Canada contest.</p>
<p class="para-p">So when I tell the nurses this time that I am finally going to hit my goal weight when this giant tumor is cut out of my colon, it gets a big response. But then I follow it up with what I have really wanted to say since I fought with<a id="GBS.0042.04"/> this doctor about my stomach pain, when I had yelled, “I am not going back out there with everyone else,” and he had rolled his eyes. He is standing beside me now, and I grab his arm, pull him toward me, and say in a low, serious voice: “I had better not die looking into your eyes.” The nurses roar. I have mentally decided that when the Lifetime movie version of my life is made, the doctor will be<a id="GBS.0042.05"/> played by Matthew McConaughey with firm instructions to always chew gum and be looking into the middle distance just past me. And I am Winona Ryder, and a thousand emotions will always flit over my perfect face.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page56" title="56"/>
<p class="para-p">The doctor will actually make another miracle for me, so audiences will have to grow to love him. The surgery has taken four hours instead of two, and the waiting room—filled to the brim<a id="GBS.0043.01"/> with my friends, my colleagues, and my dad, who won’t stop pacing—is sunk low with speculation that something has gone very wrong. Instead the doctor has taken the extra time to sew me back together instead of giving me a colostomy bag. He didn’t have to. An hour or so before the surgery, a woman with a very calming voice had stopped by with a giant plastic bag and told me that I would be, well,<a id="GBS.0043.02"/> going to the bathroom out of a hole in my stomach for the foreseeable future but not to worry. A <em class="char-i">lot</em> of celebrities have them. And I said something deep like “Sure,” because at the time, I didn’t think I’d make it through the night anyway.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page57" title="57"/>
<p class="para-p">The way that doctors are delicately picking up and handling the words “Stage Four” suggests that I am a spaghetti bowl of cancer. And oddly, this reality has<a id="GBS.0043.03"/> filled me with love. Love for my son. Love for my friends and family. Love for my husband, sitting beside me, squeezing my hand moments before the surgery.</p>
<p class="para-p">“This is proof,” he says, “even though I never questioned it. But the way you look at me.” He stops. He can’t say any more. But he knows—I hope he knows—that I have loved him since he was fifteen and put bleach spray in his blond hair to make<a id="GBS.0043.04"/> it even blonder and wore purple tank tops that should never be spoken of.</p>
<p class="para-p">He is the reason that, when he leaves me for a moment, I call Chelsea and my sister-in-law and give them instructions in an artificially determined voice: “You have to promise me that you will tell him to get remarried. I don’t want this to be the end of both our lives.” By the time I have reached the words “Zach needs<a id="GBS.0043.05"/> a mom,” I can’t say any more and they can’t hear any more. They want to hear that I will fight and pull myself back from the edge. I want to hear that it is settled that my life and my love will not undo each other.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page58" title="58"/>
<p class="para-p">I couldn’t sleep last night, and I spent the hours alone, awake, thinking through questions that are useless to me now. Why did the doctors keep sending me home in pain all summer?<a id="GBS.0044.01"/> How could the ER doctor give me antacids and tell me that people come in with all manner of stubbed toes and little things these days? I spent the summer with bright pink Pepto-Bismol in my purse and waves of stomach pain that left me gasping. And, after all that, I got the second-least-sexy cancer, colon cancer. At least it’s not rectal cancer.</p>
<p class="para-p">But I wake up after surgery, surprised. Pleased.<a id="GBS.0044.02"/> As I am rolled through the hallways from the operating room, I see another good friend, Chad, who drove all night from Alabama to stand beside Toban with an encouraging smile on his face.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Oh, buddy,” I apparently say to him, “of course you’re here…that is <em class="char-i">so</em> nice….And you look soooooo skinny.”</p>
<p class="para-p">It is the first of many things I tell people when I am on drugs, because Drugged Kate has a lot of<a id="GBS.0044.03"/> feelings and opinions about how people should live their lives. Mostly I try to tell my friends and family how much they mean to me but end up saying that and more.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page59" title="59"/>
<p class="para-p">A few hours later I am sitting with a beloved friend. “Oh, my dear one, it’s time. It’s time to go. You can leave your career! Yes, it’s still undone. The work here is still undone. But if you stay here a bitterness is going to eat<a id="GBS.0044.04"/> up everything I love about you. If you don’t go, I will hate you forever.” I say that last bit to make him laugh, because my hand is on his head and tears are trickling down both our faces. He is getting older, but he will leave town not long after this and start life over someplace new. Later, just knowing that he is happy—that people I adore can restart their lives—glues something inside of me<a id="GBS.0044.05"/> back together.</p>
<p class="para-p">A colleague is sitting beside me, and I am, for a reason I can’t later remember, telling him what to do: “You can’t be happy unless you forgive them and set them aside. There is no way around it, buddy. You have to forgive.” My friend is stuck, but if he were unstuck, oh, he would conquer the world. But first he must stop carrying the weight of disappointment and comparison. I<a id="GBS.0045.01"/> don’t know why I never said that before.</p>
<p class="para-p">I save my most terrible love for Chelsea, my rock, my friendship twin. The nurses are changing my bandages, and I have my phone pressed hot against my ear. Chelsea and I are trying to talk, but there is too much to say.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page60" title="60"/>
<p class="para-p">“I think I’m running out of time, honey,” I say finally. “I’m not trying to be dramatic, but here’s what I worry about: What if you are<a id="GBS.0045.02"/> too?” She knows what I am saying. She is working harder than anyone I have ever known, but her selflessness has caused her to surrender too much of herself to “someday.” And now someday has come, at least for me.</p>
<p class="para-p">Whenever I have fallen apart, she has reassembled the pieces. I know she wants to reach through the phone and pull me back into our bubble, where one of us cries and the other diagnoses<a id="GBS.0045.03"/> the problem with merciless affection.</p>
<p class="para-p">“I have to go,” I say finally. “I’ve got to adjust my meds.” But we just sit there, clinging to goodbye, before I say at last: “Go live your life, Chels.”</p>
<p class="para-p">All these words I am tripping over are benedictions. Live unburdened. Live free. Live without forevers that don’t always come. These are my best hopes for you, that you press forward at last. I don’t know<a id="GBS.0045.04"/> how to die, but I know how to press this crushing grief into hope, hope for them. It doesn’t sound much like goodbye. It sounds more like this: Fare thee well, my loves.</p>

<p class="para-sp"><span class="char-first cso_10">P<span class="smallcaps">EOPLE COME TO MY BEDSIDE</span></span> in the hospital, but then they go, and the beep, beep, beep of the heart rate monitor remains. This is the most alone I’ve ever been. I grew up surrounded by communities of Mennonites, and you’re<a id="GBS.0045.05"/> never alone when you’re with them. Mennonites are people with the land in their blood and a hopeless obsession with simplicity, frugality, pacifism, and Jell-O salads. I’m not Mennonite by birth, but I attended a Mennonite church, a Mennonite Bible camp, and a Mennonite wedding—my own. I married a gorgeous, square-jawed Mennonite boy when both of us were practically teenagers and he was still mildly<a id="GBS.0046.01"/> enchanted by my propensity for spontaneous song. But a Mennonite marriage was a rich inheritance, as I acquired enough people to fill an entire basement of folding tables covered in turkey and jiggling salads for Thanksgiving.</p>
<p class="para-p">The best and worst parts of Mennonite culture stem from the fact that it is an exclusive club. Since they typically immigrated to the United States and Canada in huge waves,<a id="GBS.0046.02"/> often from the same communities in southern Russia, all Mennonites come from the same stock. Where I grew up, they have one of twenty exciting last names to choose from: Dueck, Loeppky, Penner, Barkman, Friesen, et cetera. I was often a bridesmaid in a Friesen-Friesen wedding, and even at my own wedding rehearsal, when I asked for Mark Penner to come up to the front, three people stood up. Most<a id="GBS.0046.03"/> people are born into the tribe and, though science has not yet proven it, I’m pretty sure they are genetically predisposed to singing in four-part harmony and making thick-braided breads and homemade jam. Mennoniteland was also the best place on earth to find a boyfriend.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page62" title="62"/>
<p class="para-p">But the part I miss right now is how wonderful they are at suffering together. Every Mennonite family is the bearer of a sad<a id="GBS.0046.04"/> history kept in living memory. They make time to tell the kids about the first Canadian winters endured by their great-grandparents and proudly display a massive coffee table version of a book called <em class="char-i">Martyrs Mirror</em> from the 1600s, which catalogs the grisly deaths of their ancestors. Perhaps that is the most oddly comforting thing about joining the Mennonite club: they insist that suffering never<a id="GBS.0046.05"/> be done alone. People tell stories about “our” suffering, “our” town, “our” community. When some Mennonite factions objected to, say, English-language instruction in the classroom, whole communities uprooted and moved together to a new place to start afresh. They might be the most quarrelsome group I have ever studied. I once read an entire year’s worth of debates over the continued use of a hymnal<a id="GBS.0047.01"/> they already liked. But I love their goal—unanimity. They will live and die together.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page63" title="63"/>
<p class="para-p">I am starting to worry that I will die here, apart, away from my home among the Mennonites of Canada, away from that delicious feeling of being folded into something. It was a feeling that began for me at Thanksgiving years ago, when I saw that Toban’s Grandma Penner had put my name in black ink on a little<a id="GBS.0047.02"/> place card on my plate. Toban and I were only dating, but there I was—written into their lives on a note card she kept year after year. Suddenly, the house seemed alive. I could hear the gentle ribbing of the men comparing notes on cars they had wrecked and see Toban’s aunts, cousins, and sisters setting down a dozen pies on the Ping-Pong table. Grandma Penner called me over and, with her wrinkled<a id="GBS.0047.03"/> hands, showed me how to roll the buns into thick pull-apart sheets. After we all sat down to the folding tables and sang the doxology, one of the young wives of a second cousin looked at my place card.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Pen, huh?” she asked wryly.</p>
<p class="para-p">I smiled.</p>
<p class="para-p">“That’s fantastic,” she said, with a laugh. “You’re in. My grandma took one look at my brother’s girlfriend and whispered to me, ‘Let’s put this one down<a id="GBS.0047.04"/> in pencil.’ ”</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page64" title="64"/>
<p class="para-p">But not everything can be done together. Toban is sitting beside me on the hospital bed and I’m trying to explain it to him, the way that everyone acts like one day I will fly away. A new pair of wings will suddenly sprout on my back and my feet will lift off the ground. I will wave goodbye as I am taken up, up into the clouds.</p>
<p class="para-p">“It’s not like that,” I tell Toban. “I will not fly<a id="GBS.0047.05"/> away.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Toban is looking at me with that studied expression he gets when he doesn’t understand but he knows it is the wrong time to ask a question. He leans toward me and takes both my hands.</p>
<p class="para-p">“I will not fly away,” I repeat, my speech garbled with emotion. I keep thinking about this boy I heard about, a teenage boy in his final days of dying from cancer. He kept choking until his doctor finally<a id="GBS.0048.01"/> figured out what he wanted. He wanted one last, hard cry, but his lungs were so filled with fluid that he couldn’t catch his breath. So the nurses were called and they managed to slowly drain his lungs so the boy could sob until that one horrible and satisfying full stop.</p>
<p class="para-p">“I don’t know how to explain it, Toban. It’s like we’re all floating on the ocean, holding on to our own inner tubes. We’re<a id="GBS.0048.02"/> all floating around, but people don’t seem to know that we’re all sinking. Some are sinking faster than others, but we’re all sinking!”</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page65" title="65"/>
<p class="para-p">I keep having the same unkind thought—<em class="char-i">I am preparing for death and everyone else is on Instagram.</em> I know that’s not fair—that life is hard for everyone—but I sometimes feel like I’m the only one in the world who is dying.</p>
<p class="para-p">“We’re all sinking, slowly, but one<a id="GBS.0048.03"/> day, while everyone watches, I will run out of air. I am going to go under.” Even explaining it, I feel more and more frantic. “There will be a day when I can’t take my next breath. And I will drown.”</p>
<p class="para-p">I can picture it so clearly. People talk about heaven like it’s a hop, a skip, and a jump. A veil between heaven and earth will part and I will pass through it.</p>
<p class="para-p">The promise of heaven to me is this:<a id="GBS.0048.04"/> someday I will get a new set of lungs and I will swim away.</p>
<p class="para-p">But first I will drown.</p>

I have rescued twenty pounds of chubby arms, legs, and cheeks and set him free to move about the house to identify toy tractors and bring fleece onesies back into fashion.</p>
<p class="para-p">Ever since the diagnosis there has been a moment, in the minute between sleeping and waking, when<a id="GBS.0049.01"/> I forget, when I have only a lingering sense that there is something I am supposed to remember.

But in the day—the real day—I am beginning to notice the expansion of this grief. My friends bear the brunt of<a id="GBS.0049.03"/> my honesty. Chelsea starts to receive all my passwords and firm instructions about how my work should be handled. Laceye learns where all the diaries are kept that I would rather not leave for posterity. The diary of twelve-year-old Kate will be allowed to remain, because it is a daily account of what a boy named Colin was doing and I am convinced that if Colin committed a crime in 1992 and is later<a id="GBS.0049.04"/> put on trial, my diary is so thorough that it would either convict or exonerate him.</p>

There is something about a ceilingless world, the slow drift of clouds, and<a id="GBS.0050.03"/> the sound of birds that staves off the taste of fear.</p>
<p class="para-p">“What, Dad?” I love calling him Dad. He has earned it with his gentle fix-it nature and his willingness to braid my hair on camping trips.</p>

<p class="para-sp"><span class="char-first cso_10">I<span class="smallcaps"> ONCE STUMBLED INTO </span></span>a prosperity megachurch expecting to find a regular service and instead found a funeral. I picked up the bulletin and saw a famous face staring back at me from the cover, smiling as he always did. I had considered him to be a kind and straightforward sort of preacher, happy to guarantee healing and prosperity because<a id="GBS.0052.02"/> he believed in God’s abundant provision with his whole heart. But he died in middle age surrounded by people—well-meaning people—clawing for the meaning of his death. Even the bulletin had to include a separate section to address the question on everyone’s minds: <em class="char-i">Why?</em> <em class="char-i">Did he lack faith? Did he fail to live out his own teachings?</em> In a theological universe in which everything you do comes back to<a id="GBS.0052.03"/> you like a boomerang—for good or for ill—those who die young become hypocrites or failures. Those loved and lost are just that, those who have lost the test of faith.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page72" title="72"/>
<p class="para-p">I have heard countless stories of denial in the face of death. A pastor stops a funeral to try to resurrect a young boy being put into the ground. A woman in the hospital hears her diagnosis and refuses treatment because she believes<a id="GBS.0052.04"/> God will heal her, growing frail as her family watches in desperation. A famous healer dies after using his own ulcerated leg as a litmus test for his faith. The United States Postal Service asks a prosperity preacher to cease claiming the power to resurrect the dead. Desperate families have stopped up the flow of mail to his headquarters with coffins.</p>
<p class="para-p">But mostly I see people who refuse to allow<a id="GBS.0052.05"/> their loved ones to grow weary. In the waiting room, a daughter asks her elderly mother to put on her lipstick and smile before seeing the doctor. A man I know wants to call it quits on his painful gauntlet of medical treatments, but he can’t bear the disappointment of his family. My nurse keeps saying, “But at least you’re here now!” when reviewing the boxes I have checked on the form she has<a id="GBS.0053.01"/> given me: Fatigue. Insomnia. Pain. Depression. There are no words that don’t sound like surrender.</p>

<p class="para-p">People begin to take their turns grieving me because it can’t be done all at once. Family and friends who could not be at the hospital for my operation come to stay at the house, and we start all over at the beginning. I sit outside, wrapped<a id="GBS.0053.02"/> in the same blankets and taking in the sunshine, all my favorite people orbiting around me. My pastor takes out her Psalms and reads a little, gripping my hand. My mom cooks a lot, stocking the freezer with everything that is suggested to be anticancer. My older sister, Amy, sends treats and constant encouragement, while Maria, my younger sister, gives me her words when she can’t be there, sending<a id="GBS.0053.03"/> me poems and bits of trivia from New York, where she is working as an editor for a Catholic magazine. She has two big hopes for me: one, that I will be cured; the other, that, before it is over, I will punch the nearest inconsiderate person in the face.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page74" title="74"/>
<p class="para-p">I have so many fears, spoken and unspoken. When I first got my job at Duke and realized that I was going to live in the United States for some<a id="GBS.0053.04"/> time, I made a lot of loud protestations about how <em class="char-i">“I will not die in a foreign land!”</em> I also made clear that I would not die in my office, not only because that had happened before to professors (prone, as they are, to get preoccupied by their research) but also because it seemed sad, at twenty-nine, to feel exiled to the Land of Opportunity for eternity. I think back on how I casually strategized<a id="GBS.0053.05"/> about where I would be buried, concerned that I would never be able to reconcile all the parts of my identity. A daughter who lives far from family. A friend who spends too much time at work. A wanderer but a type A planner. I wondered if I would ever be one, whole person. But now I am not hoping for completeness of any kind. All I can think of are the logistics. One night I wake up almost every<a id="GBS.0054.01"/> hour because my mind has seized on a horrible question: Wouldn’t it be a paperwork nightmare to move my body? To take me home?</p>
<p class="para-p">When I teach pastors at the seminary where I work, I lecture them about the First Great Awakening and religious responses to the Civil War and how their political differences will ruin their next Thanksgiving if they don’t learn to shut their traps. But as a historian,<a id="GBS.0054.02"/> I have never spent any time teaching them how to perform baptisms, officiate weddings, or conduct funerals. And I have certainly never told them what to say when they visit someone who is dying and how not to sit on her couch, mouth full of cookies, and ask endless questions about how cancer treatment works. I did not tell them how few of their words are needed but how much their hands are wanted,<a id="GBS.0054.03"/> a hand on my back as I tear up, a hand on my head for a soft prayer for healing. When I feel I am fading away, these hands prop me up and make me new. When my older colleague Frank, who lost his own adult son, found his way into my hospital room, he wrapped his strong hands around mine and said, quietly: “I wore this clerical collar to impress you. And also to get through hospital security.”</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page75" title="75"/>
<p class="para-p"><a id="GBS.0054.04"/>The prosperity gospel understands the power of touch perhaps better than anyone except maybe Catholics, who are always making everything into something you can run through your fingers or, if it’s bolted to the floor, at least take worshipful pictures next to. But prosperity believers run a close second. The earliest prosperity preachers were tent revivalists who used to get down into the crowd at<a id="GBS.0054.05"/> the pinnacle of the service, rolling up their sleeves to lay their hands on the heads and limbs of trembling believers. And when they retired a tent—because the audiences were either too large or too small—the enterprising preachers would cut these canvas cathedrals into little squares to mail to supporters, the fabric ostensibly saturated with healing power that people could hold in their hands.<a id="GBS.0055.01"/> When Oral Roberts, famous televangelist and founder of the first charismatic university, wanted to help at-home audiences to believe, he used to raise his right hand to the camera so viewers could press their hands against the screen. The next best thing to skin on skin. They call these things “points of contact,” the mediation of sacred power through objects. It is like God reaching out through<a id="GBS.0055.02"/> something, bridging that last divide between divine and human, invisible and visible, spirit and flesh. These are points of contact, but they cannot be called sacraments because that would be too Catholic and it looks too Catholic already.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page76" title="76"/>
<p class="para-p">When I was in college, my gloriously hippie friends loved to make a huge deal about the fact that I was a Christian. I had not yet realized that Americans<a id="GBS.0055.03"/> choose colleges based on their personalities. Everything I knew about college at that point I had picked up from the Saturday morning sitcom <em class="char-i">Saved by the Bell,</em> and none of the characters had ever mentioned that delightfully liberal granola schools would not be filled with those who thought fondly of their years growing up in narrow-minded Christian towns. In fact, they would find you and your<a id="GBS.0055.04"/> faith to be somewhat hilarious and, for a semester, submit your campus mailing address to prosperity preachers around the country. When you went to open your mailbox, it would be full of spiritual handkerchiefs to place on an afflicted body part, green oil to rub on your forehead, fake gold coins to tuck into your shoes, or any number of things to put under your pillow. The prosperity gospel is a<a id="GBS.0055.05"/> faith meant to be touched and held.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page77" title="77"/>
<p class="para-p">I start to surround myself with <em class="char-i">things</em>. Toban builds a little shelf to go beside the bed so that I can reach for books as I lie there. There are a few rows of practical items to make me feel useful—bottled water, light hand weights, and a stack of the latest American religious-history titles. Everything else is a friend. Two icons—one the looming figure of<a id="GBS.0056.01"/> Archangel Michael and the other of St. Peregrine, an Italian friar and the patron saint of cancer patients—shine, their cracked-gold painted faces gazing at me. An old frame shows two blurry teenagers grinning at the camera. It was my first photo with Toban, and we are jumping for some reason. A little wooden piano plays a delicate tune and holds old Canadian bills, tarnished necklaces, and polished<a id="GBS.0056.02"/> rocks my grandfather once collected. And on a large black canvas, a hand-drawn sign quoting the heroine of my favorite television show reads: “It’s so weird being my own role model.” I surround myself with reminders, things I can touch, that remind me of a time when I was Kate, and she could get out of bed.</p>

All the worst things happen in the dark. When I was in the hospital, I learned that when doctors want to tell you something, they will tell you at 4:00 <span class="smallcaps char-sc">A.M</span>., when they start rounds and you are sleeping, and if it’s really bad, they will send the person with the shortest lab coat. Seniority works in white coats, from the longest (read: fanciest head doctor) to the shortest (read: the greenest<a id="GBS.0056.04"/> and most anxious doctor in the universe). So when I first heard how long I had to live, I drew the short coat. Apparently in research hospitals, this is a teaching moment. Find the person having the worst moment of her or his life, and send the intern. But my short coat was from Canada, so all mercy was granted. He sat down, and of everything he said, all I remembered was “You have a thirty<a id="GBS.0056.05"/> to fifty percent chance of survival.” By their definition, <em class="char-i">survival</em> meant two years of life. And everything in my mind blurred and slowed. All I could think of to say was “If you’re going to say stuff like that to me, you’d better be holding my hand.” <em class="char-i">Hold my hand,</em> I kept thinking. <em class="char-i">Don’t give up on me just yet.</em></p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page79" title="79"/>
<p class="para-p">Everything around me is nudging me toward giving up hope that I will make it through<a id="GBS.0057.01"/> this year. I am in the cancer clinic for a quick checkup on my surgical stitches and the physician assistant walks in. She moves through the pleasantries with enough warmth to suggest that, at least on social occasions, she considers herself to be a nice person.</p>
<p class="para-p">“How are you?” she asks, pressing on my stomach lacerations as I stifle a sharp intake of breath.</p>
<p class="para-p">“It’s hard,” I say, pretending to<a id="GBS.0057.02"/> read the posters on the wall to keep myself from choking up.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Well,” she says, getting up and tidying the supplies, “the sooner you get used to the idea of dying the better.” I stare at her, but she is zooming around the room and out the door, on to the next unfortunate recipient of her care. I get up and make it out of the cancer clinic before I crumple in a heap on the wooden bench next to<a id="GBS.0057.03"/> the front door.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page80" title="80"/>
<p class="para-p">Sometime later I will meet a woman with my same cancer and my same life—a husband and a toddler—and she will say the words I was feeling in that moment:</p>

<p class="para-sp"><span class="char-first cso_10">T<span class="smallcaps">HERE WAS ONE POINT </span></span>in the hospital right after my surgery<a id="GBS.0057.04"/> when I was allowed to see Zach. In those two minutes he looked up at me, furious and crying, with his hands in the air. He never screams, but he screamed at me because I was too weak to pick him up. And all I thought was, <em class="char-i">I can’t leave you here. Alone.</em></p>
<p class="para-p">It is an easy lie that has wormed its way into my mind: <em class="char-i">I am the center that must hold.</em> It is a thought I picked up so early on in my life that<a id="GBS.0057.05"/> I can’t bring myself to question it. It is something closer to a reflex. Life is unstable because it is life. But I am steady.</p>
<p class="para-p">My mother-in-law likes to make art out of colored wires, and she made me something sweet to put by my bed. It is three dangling hearts hanging in a long chain. A pink heart. A blue heart. A silver heart. Me, Toban, Zach. And when I saw it, I immediately believed it as<a id="GBS.0058.01"/> a lie about our love. <em class="char-i">Yes, this all hangs on me.

<p class="para-p">My friend Carolyn and I are driving home from an appointment at the hospital a few weeks later, and she points to the local school as we drive by.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Is that where Zach will go?” she says. A normal question said in a normal voice to a woman who doesn’t know what any of that means anymore.</p>
<p class="para-p">“I don’t know, honey. I don’t<a id="GBS.0058.02"/> know if Toban and Zach will keep living here if I’m gone. They’ll probably be in Canada.”</p>
<p class="para-p">My mind has skipped ahead to a patch of land north and west of the first Mennonite settlements in Manitoba. Toban’s grandfather and uncle have a beautiful farm there, where the dirt is dark and rich as deep as you can dig a grave. <em class="char-i">Rich as deep as you can dig a grave</em>. It’s one of those offhanded comments<a id="GBS.0058.03"/> that Uncle Kurt makes when he talks about the land, his lightly inflected German accent twisting poetry into all the talk of grain and fixing the silo on one side of the property. Not far away is the buried history of this Mennonite settlement, an unassuming cluster of gravestones beside a ditch by an old highway. Every tour I have ever gotten of the area includes that graveyard, and the constant<a id="GBS.0058.04"/> reminder that it sits where the wooden German schoolhouse was and the old Mennonite church <em class="char-i">used</em> to be.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page82" title="82"/>
<p class="para-p">There is an accidental beauty to being buried in the graveyard by the ditch, wedged between the memories of two institutions. If you want to get a plot there, you just have to call Abe from the town of Winkler, and he will dig one out for $250 including maintenance. It’s a steal. All I want<a id="GBS.0058.05"/> to tell Carolyn is that I don’t know where Zach will be, but that she will probably find me between the ditch and the cornfield. But I can’t tell her that. My brain is bouncing back and forth between two worn tracks—one set of plans that assume I will die and another equally sure I will survive. I make preparations just in case. I choose a preacher for my eulogy during a long, quiet moment.</p>
<p class="para-p"><em class="char-i"><a id="GBS.0059.01"/>Surrender</em> seems like such a Christian word, as if I were letting go and sinking into the arms of God. Presbyterians, who are known for their staunch belief that God is the benevolent dictator of all that is good, would weep for joy at anyone who described herself as “surrendered.” From the Presbyterian point of view I am a passive vehicle of God’s grace. Like the lamb in Sunday school artwork,<a id="GBS.0059.02"/> I am an adorable woolly passenger on Jesus’ shoulders.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page83" title="83"/>
<p class="para-p">To believers in the prosperity gospel, surrender sounds like defeat. They write books with titles like <em class="char-i">Deal with It!</em> to remind readers that there is nothing so difficult that God cannot accomplish it, and that you, sir or ma’am, had better get cracking. There are no setbacks, just setups. There are no trials, just tests of character. Tragedies<a id="GBS.0059.03"/> are simply opportunities to claim a bigger, better miracle.</p>
<p class="para-p">I often wonder if the prosperity gospel’s never-give-up spirit produces resilient believers. Does it make happier people? Do people find themselves emboldened, shielded from the trials of daily life by the promise that they are more than conquerors? I can’t tell. All I know is that a cheerful person can look a lot like someone with total<a id="GBS.0059.04"/> mastery over everything that would weigh a lesser person down.</p>
<p class="para-p">At the hospital, I can always spot prosperity believers by their desk space, because there will inevitably be Post-its taped around their monitors with little positive sayings (“You can’t change the past, but you can change the future!”) or scripture (“I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me!”). The nurses are harder<a id="GBS.0059.05"/> to identify but come out like preachers if I happen to say anything negative.</p>
<p class="para-p">“As they say, you got to name it and claim it,” said one nurse as she was drawing blood. “I just know that everything is going to work out!”</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page84" title="84"/>
<p class="para-p">Control is a drug, and we are all hooked, whether or not we believe in the prosperity gospel’s assurance that we can master the future with our words and attitudes. I can barely<a id="GBS.0060.01"/> admit to myself that I have almost no choice but to surrender, but neither can those around me. I can hear it in my sister-in-law’s voice as she tells me to keep fighting. I can see it in my academic friends, who do what researchers do and google the hell out of my problem. “When did the symptoms start?” they ask. “Is this hereditary?” Buried in all their concern is the unspoken question: Do I<a id="GBS.0060.02"/> have any control?</p>
<p class="para-p">A friend of a friend stops by with heaps and heaps of kale and flies around the kitchen with instructions about how to harness its healing properties. She is trying her best, I can see that, but I am slumped against the counter, half-listening in a fog of pain medication.

<p class="para-p">Toban and I get into a stupid fight when he finds me eating a huge, puffy Rice Krispies Treat. Don’t I know that sugar causes cancer?

<p class="para-p">Infertility and<a id="GBS.0060.04"/> disability should have taught me how to surrender, taught me how little I can control the conditions of my own happiness. Instead, that helplessness has only thickened my resolve to salvage what I can from the wreckage. If the physiotherapist says “One lap,” I do two. When the doctor says, “You’ll be out in four days,” I push for three. I would like to blame it on some charming quirk—“I’m plucky!”—but<a id="GBS.0060.05"/> it’s more than that. I don’t know how to stop. When I was little, my dad would read stories from Greek mythology, and I loved one most of all—that prideful king Sisyphus, who was doomed to roll a boulder up an impossibly steep hill only to have it roll down again. He would discover for all eternity that not every burden can be shouldered. <em class="char-i">Yes,</em> I would think, learning nothing. <em class="char-i">But at least he kept<a id="GBS.0061.01"/> trying</em>.</p>
<p class="para-p">My two best friends from Canada come with me for my first chemotherapy treatment and, like only best friends can, immediately invent nicknames for everyone we meet. There is Chipper Chad and Needle Nancy, but after a grim presentation by one of the nurses, Exaggerator Eve is born for her chilling words: “I’ve noticed that when people in chemotherapy get tired and take a nap, they never…get…up.”</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page86" title="86"/><a id="GBS.0061.02"/>
<p class="para-p">If I never nap. If I never complain. If I stifle my sharp intake of breath when I feel the pain. If I hide the reality, then maybe I’m not sick. So I continue to work full days. I get up at 6:30 <span class="smallcaps char-sc">A.M.</span> every day—no matter what—so I won’t miss a moment with my son. When I stop taking the medication that minimizes the numb feeling in my hands and feet, because I want to feel every shred of what is<a id="GBS.0061.03"/> happening to me, my friends practically stage an intervention. When will I realize that surrender is not weakness?</p>
<p class="para-p">St. Teresa of Avila once said: “We can only learn to know ourselves and do what we can—namely, surrender our will and fulfill God’s will in us.” For Christians not of the prosperity persuasion, surrender is a virtue; the writings of the saints are full of commands to “let go” and<a id="GBS.0061.04"/> to submit yourself to what seems to be the will of the Almighty. All of American culture and pop psychology scream against that. Never give up on your dreams! Just keep knocking, that door is about to open! Think positively! Self-improvement guaranteed!! The entire motivational-speaking industry rests on the assumption that you can have what you want, you can be what you want. Just do it.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page87" title="87"/>
<p class="para-p">When<a id="GBS.0061.05"/> prosperity believers live out their daily struggles with smiles on their faces, sometimes I want to applaud. They confront the impossible and joyfully insist that God make a way. They obediently put miracle oil on their failing bodies. They give large offerings to the church and expect great things. They stubbornly get out of their hospital beds and declare themselves healed, and every now and then,<a id="GBS.0062.01"/> it works.</p>
<p class="para-p">They are addicted to self-rule, and so am I.</p></div><div style="display:none;"><a id="GBS.0062.02"/></div></body></html>
