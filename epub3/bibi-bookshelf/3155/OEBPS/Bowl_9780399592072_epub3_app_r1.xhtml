<p class="para-bmp-alt2">Whoa. Hold up there. Were you about to make a comparison? At least it’s not…what? Stage V cancer? Don’t minimize.</p>
<div class="custom_list">
<p class="para-apnlf list0 italic"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="char-app-b sans roman">2</span>. </span>“In my long life, I’ve learned that…”</p></div>
<p class="para-bmp-alt2">Geez. Do you want a medal? I get it! You lived forever. Well, some people are worried that they won’t, or that things<a id="GBS.0111.02"/> are so hard they won’t want to. So ease up on the life lessons. Life is a privilege, not a reward.</p>
<div class="custom_list"><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page170" title="170"/>
<p class="para-apnlf list0 italic"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="char-app-b sans roman">3</span>. </span>“It’s going to get better. I promise.”</p></div>
<p class="para-bmp-alt2">Well, fairy godmother, that’s going to be a tough row to hoe when things go badly.</p>
<div class="custom_list">
<p class="para-apnlf list0 italic"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="char-app-b sans roman">4</span>. </span>“God needed an angel.”</p></div>
<p class="para-bmp-alt2">This one takes the cake because (a) it makes God look sadistic and needy and (b) angels are, according to Christian tradition, created from<a id="GBS.0111.03"/> scratch. Not dead people looking for a cameo in <em class="char-i">Ghost.</em> You see how confusing it is when we just pretend that the deceased return to help you find your car keys or make pottery?</p>
<div class="custom_list">
<p class="para-apnlf list0 italic"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="char-app-b sans roman">5</span>. </span>“Everything happens for a reason.”</p></div>
<p class="para-bmp-alt2">The only thing worse than saying this is pretending that you know the reason. I’ve had hundreds of people tell me the reason for my cancer. Because of my sin. Because of my unfaithfulness.<a id="GBS.0111.04"/> Because God is fair. Because God is unfair. Because of my aversion to Brussels sprouts. I mean, no one is short of reasons. So if people tell you this, make sure you are there when they go through the cruelest moments of their lives, and start offering your own. When someone is drowning, the only thing worse than failing to throw them a life preserver is handing them a reason.</p>

<p class="para-bmp-alt2">I thought I should listen to my oncologist and my nutritionist and my team of specialists, but it turns out that I should be listening to you. Yes, please, tell me more about the medical secrets that only one flaxseed provider in Orlando knows. Wait, let me get a pen.</p>

<p class="para-bmp-alt2">My darling dear, I know you are trying to relate to me. Now you see me<a id="GBS.0112.01"/> and you are reminded that terrible things have happened in the world. But guess what? That is where I live, in the valley of the shadow of death. But now I’m on vacation because I’m not in the hospital or dealing with my mess. Do I have to take my sunglasses off and join you in the saddest journey down memory lane, or do you mind if I finish my mojito?</p>

<p class="para-bmp-alt2">This is the toughest one of all. I can hear you trying to understand my world and be on my side. But picture the worst thing that has ever happened to you. Got it? Now try to put it in a sentence. Now say it aloud fifty times a day. Does your head hurt? Do you feel sad? Me too. So let’s just see if I want to talk about it today because sometimes I do and sometimes I want a hug<a id="GBS.0112.03"/> and a recap of <em class="char-i">American Ninja Warrior.</em></p></div></div><div style="display:none;"><a id="GBS.0112.04"/></div></body></html>
