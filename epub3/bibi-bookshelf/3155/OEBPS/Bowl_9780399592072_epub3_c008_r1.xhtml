<p class="para-pf stickupcaps char-dropcap-DC cso_18-DC sans-dc" style="text-indent: 0;">I<span class="char-first cso_10"><span class="smallcaps"> HAVE TAKEN UP CURSING FOR </span></span>Lent, the forty-day stretch before Easter in which those who want to understand Jesus’ sacrifice choose one of their own. They promise to abandon vices, take up new spiritual practices, or simply give up chocolate like every fourteen-year-old girl I knew at St. Mary’s Academy, who combined their sympathy with Jesus at his grisly crucifixion with<a id="GBS.0086.02"/> a spring break weight-loss program. As adults, most do-gooders I know give up alcohol or spend more time in prayer. I’ve started swearing.</p>
<p class="para-p">And I mean it. I swear about cancer. I swear about dry croissants and coffee that cools too quickly. I swear about the budding ulcers in my mouth from intense chemotherapy. I swear about the refugee crisis in Europe. I swear before and after I receive test<a id="GBS.0086.03"/> results even though I’m tremendously relieved that, so far, the tumors are still shrinking. I swear about Curious George whining to the Man in the Yellow Hat. I am relentless. Last week I cursed at my mother-in-law in what I imagine was the halfway mark of her complaining about her wrinkles and her droopy parts.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page127" title="127"/>
<p class="para-p">“I think aging is a fucking privilege,” I say squarely.</p>
<p class="para-p">There is a silence between<a id="GBS.0086.04"/> us at the Starbucks where we are sitting, but then she begins to laugh loudly. She has a great laugh that always whoops up to a nice, satisfying sound of shock.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Oh, well, <em class="char-i">yes</em>. I suppose it is! Yes.” She leans over the table and hugs me, and then she picks up where she left off because she has been my mom, too, since I was fourteen and I first met Toban. She has hummed along beside me during<a id="GBS.0086.05"/> all the seasons of my life since, and it’s not her fault that this season is beginning to spark something close to rage.</p>
<p class="para-p">I read an article about how people in grief swear because they feel the English language has reached its limit in a time of inarticulate sorrow. Or at least that is what I tell people when I am casually dropping f-bombs over lunch as I explain the mysteries of Lent.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page128" title="128"/>
<p class="para-p">I have,<a id="GBS.0087.01"/> rather childishly, told God that I will stop swearing at the end of Lent, but the truth is, I’m swearing <em class="char-i">because</em> of Lent.</p>
<p class="para-p">It started on Ash Wednesday. I had another set of scans, and Katherine, one of my very best friends, drove hours to Atlanta so we could wait together for the results. We found an Ash Wednesday service at a local Catholic church because I have always loudly proclaimed that<a id="GBS.0087.02"/> Catholics, of all God’s children, are wonderful at being sad. I have seen the mourning of Lent a million times, from Ash Wednesday to Holy Saturday: The sad kiss of an overturned cross at the front of a chapel, scraping their knees on the floor as they ignore the stares of strangers and friends. The shuffle past the inscriptions around the church marking the Stations of the Cross. When the priest<a id="GBS.0087.03"/> dips his thumb in the black ash of burnt palm leaves, marking foreheads with the sign of the cross, he whispers the last part of Genesis 3:19:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="para-extvf fb_2em"><em class="char-i">Pulvis es, et in pulverem reverteris.</em></p>
<div class="fixed-box-center">
<p class="para-extvl-alt fb_2em">From dust you came, and to dust you will return.</p></div></blockquote>
<p class="para-p">It is so grim. There is no denying our finitude. It is plain and hard and true.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page129" title="129"/>
<p class="para-p">Unfortunately, Katherine and I stumble upon a thriving Catholic church for all<a id="GBS.0087.04"/> the loveliest people, I’m sure, who want to hear the ways in which Lent is about making us a tiny bit better. The priest actually uses the phrase “tiny bit” as he describes how this might be possible. <em class="char-i">Think about volunteering once or twice</em>. <em class="char-i">Be nice to people at work.</em> <em class="char-i">Don’t forget that your gifts are special!</em> Then he doles out the ashes with all the cheer of Snow White sending her industrious dwarves<a id="GBS.0087.05"/> off to the mines.</p>
<p class="para-p">A few years ago I was in Houston, the megachurch capital of the country, interviewing prosperity leaders or representatives of some of the nation’s largest churches. I had not meant to arrive there in the busy Holy Week, but I found myself on Good Friday with nothing to do but hope that people might be free to talk on the darkest day of the Christian year. Seeing nothing on<a id="GBS.0088.01"/> the church websites, I spent the afternoon calling around to see which service I could attend. It was <em class="char-i">awkward.</em> Most were not holding services, but I was encouraged to come back on Sunday, when Jesus was risen. One lady who answered the phone baldly told me that she had no idea what I was talking about when I said “Good Friday.” Lakewood Church, Joel and Victoria Osteen’s megachurch, was the only<a id="GBS.0088.02"/> one with a Good Friday service, and I was, pen and paper in hand, going to be there.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page130" title="130"/>
<p class="para-p">Lakewood Church holds services in the former Compaq Center arena, where the Houston Rockets used to play, and attendees have to make their way from the parking deck, up endless escalators, and around the cavernous main stage to their seats like any devoted fans. An army of cheerful volunteers are scattered throughout<a id="GBS.0088.03"/> the seemingly endless space to facilitate your transition from Houston freeway exiter to worshipful participant, except, on this day, business as usual seemed odd.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Happy Good Friday!” yelled the parking attendant, flashing his glowing traffic wand.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Happy Good Friday!” chirped the woman stationed at the bottom of the escalator.</p>
<p class="para-p">By the umpteenth greeting, “Happy Good Friday!” seemed like the<a id="GBS.0088.04"/> order of the day. This was, I suspected, going to be the hap-happiest Good Friday service I had ever attended.</p>
<p class="para-p">To the Osteens’ credit, Jesus stayed dead for about three songs in the opening worship set. As the worship band played and a white mist rose to the ceiling in puffy clouds of Holy Spirit smoke, the tone stayed appropriately serious. I won’t say it was somber, but it might qualify as,<a id="GBS.0088.05"/> at least, solemn. Each song undergirded the sense that the death of Jesus was meant to solve the problem of our sin, and that God was, indeed, <em class="char-i">very</em> good. Then Victoria Osteen appeared from backstage, her stiletto heels clicking as she entered with a toothy smile.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page131" title="131"/>
<p class="para-p">“Isn’t it great we serve a risen Lord!” she asked rhetorically.</p>
<p class="para-p">On a day and at an hour during which, historically, Christians refuse<a id="GBS.0089.01"/> to speak the word <em class="char-i">Alleluia</em> (“Christ is risen”) in song or prayer, Victoria loudly skipped the moment in the tradition where Jesus is conspicuously absent. He died that day. And his disciples were, in their despair, quite convinced that he was never coming back.</p>
<p class="para-p">The English language is already a bit confused in calling the day “good” while other languages settled on Holy Friday or Great Friday<a id="GBS.0089.02"/> or, even better, Black Friday. We call it something that might have once been “God’s Day” and mull over the paradox that made it so. We have fallen in love with a God who abandons His child to die, a son who begs for His own life but, seeing it cannot be helped, gives Himself over to His murderers. He seemed like He would save them all, but on this day He just hangs there off the wood He has been<a id="GBS.0089.03"/> nailed to.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page132" title="132"/>
<p class="para-p">But Victoria was right, in a way. There was nothing particularly Good Fridayish about the fog pouring in through the deep blue ceiling. There was nothing especially sad about the actual live lamb that trotted onstage during the sermon, softly bleating as it was explained that Jesus was the Lamb slain for our sin. And there was certainly nothing intentionally depressing about the advertisements<a id="GBS.0089.04"/> for Joel and Victoria’s extensive product line flashing on the enormous screens flanking the altar, Victoria’s face peeking out from the pinky cover of her debut book, <em class="char-i">Love Your Life: Living Happy, Healthy, and Whole.</em> She was right. It was already Easter.</p>
<p class="para-p">I am out for dinner with two friends at our favorite dive restaurant and we should be having a lovely time except that I am ranting. I am livid<a id="GBS.0089.05"/> about a Facebook post that read something like “Just a little life in the midst of death!” and an accompanying video testimony about a celebrity who learned that, in trusting God, she could expand her self-esteem and her business. “Trust me with your dreams,” God had said to her, “and I will take your business farther than you could have imagined.” People are tweeting at me about having “Joseph-sized<a id="GBS.0090.01"/> expectations,” referring to the Old Testament story about a young man who suffers before rising to positions of unimagined wealth and good fortune. Everything could be mine if I would just reach for it.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page133" title="133"/>
<p class="para-p">I attend a Christian conference between hospital days, and the speaker is a gorgeous thirty-something woman with shiny hair and skinny jeans. She is telling a young audience to think hard about<a id="GBS.0090.02"/> who they have godly influence over. She looks so effortlessly perfect that she does what most female speakers do—she reaches for a self-deprecating joke. She insists that she has no luck with suburban moms (“They don’t like that I never wash my hair!”), baristas (“I never get my order right!”), urban professionals (“They’re so hip!”), and the dying.</p>
<p class="para-p">“If I saw a person who was dying, I’d be like<a id="GBS.0090.03"/> ‘Shhhhh…Goodbye…I’m so sorry…You’re scaring me…’ ” She flashes a wide smile and she gets a big laugh in return. It is approaching Holy Week, but death is still a punch line.</p>
<p class="para-p">I am facing death and the church has demanded that, for the forty days of Lent, everyone stare it down with me. We are solid flesh, and we are ashes.</p>

<p class="para-p">“Everyone is trying to Easter<a id="GBS.0090.04"/> the crap out of my Lent,” I say to my friends through gritted teeth and tears.</p>
<p class="para-p">I am marching toward the edge of a precipice, trusting that, by the time I get there, a bridge will have been built. Chemotherapy. Immunotherapy. Divine healing. Something needs to happen before I get there. <em class="char-i">Lord, build me a bridge.</em></p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp"><span class="char-first cso_10">I<span class="smallcaps"> AM SITTING ACROSS </span></span>from my friend Ray, who is a pediatric oncologist, which is<a id="GBS.0090.05"/> to say that every day he talks to children and parents about tumors and white blood cell counts and life expectancy. He is a shepherd of little lambs who are often plucked up by cancer and led to slaughter. When I look at him, I see the dogged expression of a man who fights even though he might lose. Every day he sits down with someone’s mother and father and looks them directly in the eye and says:<a id="GBS.0091.01"/> “There is hope” or “I’m sorry.” He knows what it is like to explode the world.</p>
<p class="para-p">The first time he sat on my patio like this was in the immediate aftermath of my diagnosis, when the doctors guessed I had only months to live. My house was packed to the ceiling with my family, buzzing with the exhausted energy of people trying to save the world by doing laundry and making more chicken stock. There<a id="GBS.0091.02"/> was nothing anyone could do for me, so they did everything else. Someone was always folding linens or checking on my medication or picking up groceries to stock the freezer. My mom had bought disposable surgical masks for everyone to wear, and I spent the rest of the time trying to convince people that they didn’t have to wear them. I was sitting on the patio in my cocoon of blankets when Ray popped<a id="GBS.0091.03"/> his head over the fence with a conspiratorial grin. He was carrying two bottles of expensive wine and he poured a glass for everyone, including me, the girl with giant liver tumors who probably shouldn’t be drinking anything but water. I loved him for it. He sat down beside me like we were part of the same exclusive club. And then he turned to face my parents.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page135" title="135"/>
<p class="para-p">“I am so sorry that this is happening,”<a id="GBS.0091.04"/> he said. “This is awful.”</p>
<p class="para-p">My parents looked at him for a moment, blinking. I think they were a little stunned.</p>
<p class="para-p">There is a tone that professionals often take with people in crisis, and I’ve come to recognize it as “Hostage Negotiator Neutral.” It’s the sort of voice that is trying to communicate “Don’t jump!” to a person on the edge, but implies that everyone in the room is mentally incapacitated.<a id="GBS.0091.05"/> Doctors use it with me all the time. They are telling me something important, but everything about their tone and wording suggests that they are telling me a version of the truth to keep me from jumping. “We can try a few things” usually means “This is hopeless, but I think I can stretch out your decline.” “We can focus on your comfort” always means “We’re giving up.” And no one ever, ever,<a id="GBS.0092.01"/> ever starts with the truth.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page136" title="136"/>
<p class="para-p">“This is awful,” Ray said again. And it was the truth, but it was strange to hear it said aloud. He pushed on relentlessly. “But let me tell you what I know.”</p>
<p class="para-p">He proceeded to tell them that there were a lot of new developments in cancer research and that it was going to require a certain mindset. We would need to prepare to think beyond “cured” and “dying” and think,<a id="GBS.0092.02"/> instead, about how to get me from one good outcome to another. The longer he talked the more I came to recognize the look on my parents’ faces. Hope.</p>
<p class="para-p">It is why I sometimes save my tender questions for Ray, who will tell me the truth.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page137" title="137"/>
<p class="para-p">Now we are sitting in the same place where he once faced down my two grieving parents, and there’s another open bottle of wine. It’s time.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Does it hurt to die?”<a id="GBS.0092.03"/> I ask. “In the hospital, I mean.”</p>
<p class="para-p">He pauses.</p>
<p class="para-p">“No…” he says finally. “Not really. I mean, not as much.” He has already promised me that if I fight as hard as I can—if I agree to be blasted with whatever drugs and endure whatever side effects—he will make the end as comfortable as possible. I don’t tell anyone that. But I think about it sometimes when I wonder how long I can bear the side effects<a id="GBS.0092.04"/> or the needles or the look in people’s eyes.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Are you okay?” he asks.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Yes, yes, I’m okay. Except for about ten minutes a day, I’m okay.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Anyone else would have left it at that.</p>
<p class="para-p">He looks at me carefully. “What does it look like? Those ten minutes?” he asks.</p>
<p class="para-p">I remember then that I am talking to someone who knows, almost as well as I do, what those ten minutes are like. He has seen those moments<a id="GBS.0092.05"/> play out a hundred different ways. Kids who scream. Kids who beg for it to stop. Kids who hug their stuffed animals and ask for their moms to lie beside them. Teenagers who beat their pillows and ask about what it would have been like to grow up. What is true love like? What is it like to have sex? Do you think someone would have married me?</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page138" title="138"/>
<p class="para-p">I think about his question a long time as I watch Toban<a id="GBS.0093.01"/> and Zach across the lawn. I can see Toban taking out his wrench set to fix the lawnmower, and Zach, hopping around him, is leaking his purple Popsicle all over the equipment. Toban looks up at him, frustrated and amused.</p>
<p class="para-p">“I know exactly how it feels,” I say finally, finding it hard to take my eyes off the boys. “It feels like I’m hungry and I’ll never be full again.”</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp"><span class="char-first cso_10">I<span class="smallcaps"> SWEAR FOR ALL </span></span>of Lent.<a id="GBS.0093.02"/> Every inch of it. And then one Sunday brunch, like a fever, it breaks.</p>
<p class="para-p">My friend Blair and I are sitting over perfectly cured bacon and eggs that float on tender southern biscuits, and she announces that her “death thoughts” are back. She is weaning herself off of antidepressants, now that things in her life are chugging along, but all the familiar worries about her mortality have resurfaced.<a id="GBS.0093.03"/> Her dad is suffering from early-onset Alzheimer’s, and the man she once knew is now confused and alien to her. But every time her memory slips she is brought back to a possible future: is this going to happen to her? She could take a genetic test and find out, but then she would have to live with the inevitability of her own decline, the prospect that she might lose decades of moments with a husband<a id="GBS.0093.04"/> she adores and a life she has built with incredible care.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page139" title="139"/>
<p class="para-p">Or not.</p>
<p class="para-p">She can’t bear the answer, and I realize deep into the story that I am smiling ear to ear. I am the worst person in the world. I have wept with her about her father. I have moved furniture with her into her new house, which we can all agree is the true test of friendship. She is the reason that I own a head-to-toe Tonya Harding<a id="GBS.0093.05"/> costume, complete with a figure-skating warm-up outfit covered in an American flag, even though there is no Halloween scenario in which anyone will ever look at me carrying a crowbar and say, “That’s a great Tonya Harding costume.” Blair and I have spent entire parties confusing guests by trading wigs and stayed up far too late agonizing together over failed friendships. So why am I smiling like<a id="GBS.0094.01"/> the worst person on earth?</p>
<p class="para-p">“I’m so sorry,” I say. Blair starts to laugh. “It’s not that I would ever want this for you, but—I’m sorry for saying this—but you live here too.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“What do you mean?”</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page140" title="140"/>
<p class="para-p">“You live with an uncertain future. You live here too. And—I’m so sorry—but I’m so <em class="char-i">fucking</em> grateful to have you here.”</p>
<p class="para-p">And as I start to cry over our upscale brunch, Blair starts to laugh even louder.</p></div><div style="display:none;"><a id="GBS.0094.02"/></div></body></html>
