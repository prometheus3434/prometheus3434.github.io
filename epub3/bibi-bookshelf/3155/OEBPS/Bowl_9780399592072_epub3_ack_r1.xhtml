<p class="para-bmp">My family and friends remade the world, as far as I’m concerned. Thank you to my Bowlers and my Penners for setting aside everything to pray, cook, tend, and toddler-wrangle. And thank you to my besties who flew to North Carolina and pretended<a id="GBS.0116.02"/> that, no big deal, they were going to visit anyway.</p>
<p class="para-bmp">Thank you to Duke Divinity School, you Methodist sweethearts. You were there every step of the way.</p>
<p class="para-bmp">I will never forget my superheroes in Atlanta who volunteered to feed me, house me, and take me to my weekly appointments before they had even met me. Between you and my medical team at Emory, I was in such good hands.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page178" title="178"/>
<p class="para-bmp">Greg and Susan Jones,<a id="GBS.0116.03"/> Will and Patsy Willimon, and Grant and Kathy Wacker, you won’t admit it but your efforts saved my life. If you want any of my uncompromised organs, they are yours.</p>
<p class="para-bmp">I wasn’t sure I could muster the effort and clarity to write a book like this, stuck as I am in the eternal present of cancer. But a few special people gave my ideas a future. Margaret Feinberg and Jessica Richie sat on my living room<a id="GBS.0116.04"/> floor with dreams for me I could not have conjured alone. Lauren Winner, Jessica Goudeau, and the folks at the Collegeville Institute in Minnesota gave me the encouragement and structure to do more than cry into my laptop. And Zoë Pagnamenta, my agent, and Hilary Redmon, my editor, somehow knew what to keep and what to throw away. I was so fortunate to be improved by them and the team at Random<a id="GBS.0116.05"/> House.</p>
<p class="para-bmp">And, finally, my dear Toban, thank you. You are etched in every memory. If I could, I would stay with you forever.</p></div><div style="display:none;"><a id="GBS.0116.06"/></div></body></html>
