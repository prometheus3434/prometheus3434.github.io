I am tired most of the time, but I feel driven to catalog everything and wring every bit of time for all it’s worth. I start to write. In bed, in chemo chairs, in waiting rooms, I try to say something about dying in a world where everything happens for a reason. Whenever there is a clarifying moment of grief, I jot it down.<a id="GBS.0074.02"/> And then, in a flurry, I shoot it off to <em class="char-i">The New York Times,</em> not thinking too much about whether it’s any good, but sending it because I have been infected by the urgency of death. Then an editor there sees it, and puts it on the front page of the Sunday Review. Millions of people read it. Thousands share it and start writing to me. And most begin with the same words. “I’m afraid.” <em class="char-i">Me too,</em> <em class="char-i">me<a id="GBS.0074.03"/> too.</em></p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page107" title="107"/>
<p class="para-p">“I’m afraid of the loss of my parents,” writes a young man. “I know I will lose them someday soon, and I can’t bear the thought.” “I’m afraid for my son,” says a father from Arkansas. “He has been diagnosed with a brain tumor at forty-four, which would have been devastating enough if he had not already lost his identical twin brother to the same disease a few years ago.” These letters sing<a id="GBS.0074.04"/> with unspeakable love in the face of the Great Separation. <em class="char-i">Don’t go, don’t go, you anchor my life</em>.</p>
<p class="para-p">It feels as though the world has been cracked open, and it bleeds and bleeds. Hundreds of emails, letters, pictures, and videos pour into my in-box and campus mailbox. A mother writes about her son dying young of lung cancer. He never smoked. A nurse has survived ten years past her Stage IV cancer<a id="GBS.0074.05"/> diagnosis, but her healthy husband suddenly dies one day from an undetected brain bleed. A middle-aged woman has buried her son after watching bill collectors hunt him, and hospitals, whose treatments would have saved his life, reject him. A check from Medicaid arrives in the mail nine days after his death.</p>
<p class="para-p">Strangers pour out their fury at every stage of their own grief. Depression settles on<a id="GBS.0075.01"/> the pages like a fog. A young man writes: “I guess I was hoping that God would make something of this. But it has come to nothing.” The void is deep and bottomless. And it is an unmerciful fact that some people have the right to look into my eyes and say, “You’re lucky.” A young woman gently explains to me that cancer had stolen her fertility only months before she met the love of her life. If ever<a id="GBS.0075.02"/> she shakes the disease, even for a little, she will try to adopt. “Hold your son close, you’re so fortunate to have him.” There is plenty of denial, and plenty of the deals people attempt to broker with God. “I am an atheist, but I put it aside, and I begged God to take the cancer away from my son and to put it into me.” I read that letter to my father, who is sitting in an overstuffed leather<a id="GBS.0075.03"/> chair in my living room holding his Kindle two inches from his glasses.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page108" title="108"/>
<p class="para-p">“Oh, I’ve prayed that a hundred times. ‘Please, God, why not just take me?’ ” he says a little wistfully. I scoot over beside him and rest my head on his knee.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Dad, that is about the kindest, saddest thing I’ve ever heard.” There is a gentle silence between us as I imagine that we are both thinking about how much we love<a id="GBS.0075.04"/> each other before my dad begins to speak.</p>
<p class="para-p">“But then I remember that God didn’t spare Mozart at your age…so…” He is making a gesture that suggests he is weighing a heavy object in each hand. “So, you know.” I start to laugh.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page109" title="109"/>
<p class="para-p">“What did he die of?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“The plague, I think.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Oh, geez.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Yeah. And God loves you at least as much as Mozart.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Let’s go back to loving each other in silence.”</p>
<p class="para-p">A hilarious<a id="GBS.0075.05"/> number of letters basically start with “You think <em class="char-i">you</em> have it bad?! Listen to <em class="char-i">this</em>!” followed by a litany of complaints. The weirdest part is not simply that, yes, I do feel Stage IV cancer is a bit rough, but that these are letters written by people at the ends of long lives. A seventy-three-year-old woman named Trudy writes me to say that cancer can’t be nearly as terrible as learning she was<a id="GBS.0076.01"/> adopted. <em class="char-i">Um, okay, can’t they both be bad?</em> The pain of the world is being calculated, and according to some, compassion can be doled out only by the teaspoon.</p>
<p class="para-p">I can’t fully understand the people who write to say that, sorry, their lives have been grand. I receive long accounts of how deeply satisfied some people are with their many, many achievements. “Younger by the day!” boasts an elderly pastor.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page110" title="110"/><a id="GBS.0076.02"/>
<p class="para-p">But many people write to me like family. “As a father, I am truly sorry.” “I’m a mother and I wish I could give you a hug right now.” They want to comfort me, but their experiences tell them that life is never fair. “I want you to know how much I’m praying for you and grateful for your faith. I’m sorry that we must say, like Job, ‘Though He slay me, yet will I trust in Him.’ ” <em class="char-i">Yes, yes, yes. Yet<a id="GBS.0076.03"/> will I trust in Him. I don’t know what the word “trust” means anymore, except there are moments when I realize that it feels a lot like love.</em> </p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp"><span class="char-first cso_10">I<span class="smallcaps">’VE BEEN IN TREATMENT </span></span>for five months, and now it is Palm Sunday. When we get to church, the children’s Sunday school is closed, so we are faced with the terror of having a two-year-old in the main Sunday service. The sanctuary is swimming with children.<a id="GBS.0076.04"/> They spin in circles, they climb on top of each other, but mostly they hit each other with palm fronds. In Christian art, a palm frond is a symbol of martyrdom, a little reminder to the viewer that this saint has earned his or her status in blood. But at every Palm Sunday service, the only whiff of martyrdom is the sense that every child is about three seconds from getting a palm frond in the<a id="GBS.0076.05"/> eyeball. A tired volunteer still manages a smile and hands one to my two-year-old, who is delighted.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page111" title="111"/>
<p class="para-p">Suddenly, the organ music swells and the doors fly open, and the procession has begun. It is, as all children’s programming is, completely absurd and wonderful. Some children refuse to move past the pews that hold their parents. Others sprint ahead. Three begin to cry. But most are trying to hit<a id="GBS.0077.01"/> their brothers in the eye. Zach is utterly still as he takes in the view. I know what he is seeing. His small world has not yet included vaulted ceilings and warm wooden beams and window after window of colored glass. One of his arms is wrapped around my neck, and the other is pointing everywhere as his wide blue eyes scan the room. We march up to the front of the sanctuary. Everyone is smiling<a id="GBS.0077.02"/> broadly as they stomp around the room. So taken are we by the spectacle of radiant youth that nobody is looking at the hymnal, and the space fills with loud, unself-conscious singing.</p>
<p class="para-p">I catch Toban’s eye as I hold Zach like a prize lamb, and I can tell he is trying not to cry. We are thinking the same thing: <em class="char-i">Is this one of those moments? The kind that he will have to look back on alone?</em> I hold<a id="GBS.0077.03"/> Zach up a little higher so he can wave his frond in the air, and I try to smile as a few tears trickle down my cheeks. I know where Palm Sunday falls in the story of our God. Jesus is on a donkey trudging into Jerusalem, people waving their arms in the air, tattered coats thrown down before the One who marches toward His death. It is a celebration. It is a funeral procession. Holding Zach in my<a id="GBS.0077.04"/> arms, fifteen days from my next scan, I wish I knew the difference.</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page112" title="112"/>
<p class="para-sp"><span class="char-first cso_10">M<span class="smallcaps">Y IN-BOX IS FULL </span></span>of strangers giving reasons. People offer them to me like wildflowers they picked along the way. A few people want me to cultivate spiritual acceptance. “We have had many millions of births and deaths in different life-forms,” explains a Hindu woman gently. “Don’t worry, this life shall pass and your soul<a id="GBS.0077.05"/> will move forward to its next step.” The world is a place of suffering, they write, a garden full of weeds that we tend as best we can.</p>
<p class="para-p">But most everyone I meet is dying to make me certain. They want me to know, without a doubt, that there is a hidden logic to this seeming chaos. Even when I was still in the hospital, a neighbor came to the door and told my husband that everything happens for<a id="GBS.0078.01"/> a reason.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page113" title="113"/>
<p class="para-p">“I’d love to hear it,” he replied.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Pardon?” she said, startled.</p>
<p class="para-p">“The reason my wife is dying,” he said in that sweet and sour way he has, effectively ending the conversation as the neighbor stammered something and handed him a casserole.</p>
<p class="para-p">Christians want me to reassure them that my cancer is all part of a plan. A few letters even suggest that God’s plan was that I get cancer so I<a id="GBS.0078.02"/> could help people by writing the <em class="char-i">New York Times</em> article. There is a circular logic to these attempts to explain the course of any life. If you inspire people while dying, the plan for your life was that you would become an example to others. If you don’t and you die kicking and screaming, the plan was that you discover some important divine lessons. Either way, learn to accept God’s plan.</p>
<p class="para-p">It<a id="GBS.0078.03"/> is at moments like this—when I feel everyone’s eyes on me, watching my progress and my attitude for signs of the gospel—that I am gripped with fear. If I hear the news—if the scan comes back and the oncologist says that my days won’t be renewed—will I scream or sit quietly? Will I feel peace or will I beat the ground? <em class="char-i">God, will you make a fool of me?</em></p>
<p class="para-p">What if everything is random? A woman who<a id="GBS.0078.04"/> has left the faith for science writes: “I find it comforting to believe the universe is random, because then the God I believe in is no longer cruel.” This is a painful conclusion for so many who comb through the details of their tragedies and find no evidence that God was ever there. The world, it seems, is also filled with fathers and mothers begging for their children’s lives and hearing nothing<a id="GBS.0078.05"/> but silence. And, ever after, every church service that sings that God is good rattles like tin in their ears. There can be only one reasonable conclusion, says a father whose children have all been cut down by disease: no one is listening.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page114" title="114"/>
<p class="para-p">The spring is trying to make everything new, but my world feels increasingly dark. The chemotherapy drugs are cranked up so high that my feet are tender.<a id="GBS.0079.01"/> I’ve been plagued with lockjaw and cold hypersensitivity, so that every time I touch anything cool it feels like I am being zapped with electricity. I am so forgetful about this that Toban hangs a sign on the freezer with a picture of MC Hammer that reads: GIRL, <span class="smallcaps char-sc">U CAN’T TOUCH THIS</span>. It is increasingly hard to remember that these side effects are not the same as dying. My toenail came off in my<a id="GBS.0079.02"/> sock yesterday, and my first thought was that it would spook people if I told them. I keep my voice firm and strong, but I feel as fragile as glass.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Why are you dying?” writes a man from Idaho. “Some people might think it’s cruel for God to let you die so young. But the answer is simple and crystal clear. God is a just God to let you die. This is the consequence for your sin.” I receive that<a id="GBS.0079.03"/> little word of encouragement while I sit in a hospital waiting room, watching a woman cough flecks of red, red blood onto her white sweater. She sinks back into her chair. We are all the choir of the damned.</p>

<p class="para-p">“Why is everyone trying to teach us a lesson?” she asks, and we both feel tired just thinking about it.</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp"><span class="char-first cso_10">T<span class="smallcaps">HESE ARE THE THREE </span></span>life lessons people try to teach me that, frankly, sometimes feel worse than cancer itself. The first is that I shouldn’t be so upset, because the significance of death is relative. I<a id="GBS.0080.02"/> like to call the people with that message the Minimizers. Some people do it spiritually by reminding me that, cosmically, death isn’t the ultimate end. “It doesn’t matter, in the End, whether we are here or ‘there.’ It’s all the same,” writes a woman in the prime of her youth. She includes a lot of praying hand emoticons. A lot of Christians like to remind me that heaven is my true home, which makes<a id="GBS.0080.03"/> me want to ask them if they would like to go home first. Maybe now? And atheists can be equally trite by demanding that I immediately give up any search for meaning. Someone else writes that my faith is holding me hostage to an inscrutable God. I should let go of this guesswork—these ridiculous theological reasons—and realize that we are living in an uncaring and neutral universe. But the message<a id="GBS.0080.04"/> is the same: stop complaining and accept the world as it is.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page117" title="117"/>
<p class="para-p">“We can’t always get what we want,” writes one woman, as if chiding me for asking for dessert. It reminds me of the many times in studying the prosperity gospel that I was chided for complaining. The moratorium on negative speech is so thoroughgoing that I only really saw one giant display of insubordination. I was on a trip to a particularly<a id="GBS.0080.05"/> blingy megachurch that insisted on spray-painting everything in gold. The church had set up a large wooden cross on the grounds so that believers could write prayer requests and nail them, metaphorically and literally, to the cross. When I went to tack my prayer up, I saw that someone had already put a note front and center: “I pray that this church would spend more money on employee compensation<a id="GBS.0081.01"/> and less money on golden lions.”</p>
<p class="para-p">The second lesson comes from the Teachers, who focus on how this experience is supposed to be an education in mind, body, and spirit. “I suppose that this is the ultimate test of faith for you,” one man muses, hoping that I will have the good sense to accept God’s will. “Anyway,” he says at the close of the letter, “I’ll pray for your remission, and if you die<a id="GBS.0081.02"/> that your suffering is minimal.” <em class="char-i">Thanks, Joe from Indiana.</em> Sometimes I want every know-it-all to send me a note when <em class="char-i">they</em> face the grisly specter of death, and I’ll send them a cat poster that says <span class="smallcaps char-sc">HANG IN THERE</span>!</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page118" title="118"/>
<p class="para-p">“I hope you have a ‘Job’ experience,” writes one man bluntly, and I can’t think of anything worse to wish on someone. God allowed Satan to rob Job of everything, including his children’s<a id="GBS.0081.03"/> lives. <em class="char-i">Do I need to lose something more to learn God’s character?</em> In these moments, I love the people who write to me with their simple, unvarnished conclusions. “Um…yeah,” writes a young man after describing how diseases are cutting down his family one by one. “The question of ‘What the f**k?’ is pretty much on target every day.”</p>
<p class="para-p">The hardest lessons come from the Solutions People, who are already<a id="GBS.0081.04"/> a little disappointed that I am not saving myself. “Keep smiling! Your attitude determines your destiny!” says Jane from Idaho, and I am immediately worn out by the tyranny of prescriptive joy.</p>
<p class="para-p">Because of my background in the prosperity gospel, I receive hundreds of letters from those inside the movement. These are people who, crushed by the weight of solution-focused theology, have been unable<a id="GBS.0081.05"/> to grieve. A Nigerian woman sits through weekly meetings at her job encouraging her to “talk faith-talk,” but she wants to acknowledge that, outside her office window, the bodies of abandoned babies are being collected and hauled away in black refuse bags. A bitter seed has been planted in a young father who must take his brain-dead child off life support while his extended family, steeped in prosperity<a id="GBS.0082.01"/> theology, rails against him for his inability to prevent his child’s death. I receive so many stories like this, the laments of bereaved parents who are asked to keep a smile on their faces.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page119" title="119"/>
<p class="para-p">There is a trite cruelty in the logic of the perfectly certain. Those letter writers are not simply trying to give me something. They are also, always, tallying up the sum of my life, sometimes for clues,<a id="GBS.0082.02"/> sometimes for answers, always to pronounce a verdict. But I am not on trial.</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp"><span class="char-first cso_10">T<span class="smallcaps">HE LETTERS THAT REALLY </span></span>speak to me don’t talk about why we die, they talk about <em class="char-i">who</em> was there. When you were afraid that the end had come, were you alone?</p>
<p class="para-p">A man writes to me about being taken hostage with his family and watching helplessly as the intruders pressed guns against his children’s noses while his wife<a id="GBS.0082.03"/> and daughter were threatened with rape. But God was there and he can’t explain it. He can’t explain who loosened the ropes and let him escape with his family unharmed. And he will never understand why he survived when his neighbor was found outside hanging by a rope the next morning. He doesn’t rationalize why some people are rescued and others are hanged and doubts there is a way that God “redeems”<a id="GBS.0082.04"/> situations by extracting good from them. But he knows God was there because he felt peace, indescribable peace, and it changed him forever. He ends the letter with a shrug: “I have no idea how this works, but I wish this for you as you move forward.”</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page120" title="120"/>
<p class="para-p">His description matches something I read in the newspaper the other day that summarized the findings of the Near Death Experience Research Foundation,<a id="GBS.0082.05"/> and, yes, there is such a thing. Thousands of people were interviewed about their brushes with death in every kind of situation—being in a car accident, giving birth, attempting suicide, et cetera—and many described the same odd thing: love. I’m sure I would have ignored the article if it had not reminded me of something that happened to me, something that I felt uncomfortable telling anyone.<a id="GBS.0083.01"/> It seemed too odd and too simplistic to say what I knew to be true—that when I was sure I was going to die, I didn’t feel angry. I felt loved.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page121" title="121"/>
<p class="para-p">In those first few days after my diagnosis, when I was in the hospital, I couldn’t see my son, I couldn’t get out of bed, and I couldn’t say for certain that I would survive the year. But I felt as though I’d uncovered something like a secret about faith.<a id="GBS.0083.02"/> Even in lucid moments, I found my feelings so difficult to explain. I kept saying the same thing: “I don’t want to go back. I don’t want to go back.”</p>
<p class="para-p">At a time when I should have felt abandoned by God, I was not reduced to ashes. I felt like I was floating, floating on the love and prayers of all those who hummed around me like worker bees, bringing notes and flowers and warm socks and quilts<a id="GBS.0083.03"/> embroidered with words of encouragement. They came in like priests and mirrored back to me the face of Jesus.</p>
<p class="para-p">When they sat beside me, my hand in their hands, my own suffering began to feel like it had revealed to me the suffering of others, a world of those who, like me, are stumbling in the debris of dreams they thought they were entitled to and plans they didn’t realize they had made.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page122" title="122"/>
<p class="para-p">That<a id="GBS.0083.04"/> feeling stayed with me for months. In fact, I had grown so accustomed to that floating feeling that I started to panic at the prospect of losing it. So I began to ask friends, theologians, historians, pastors I knew, and nuns I liked, <em class="char-i">What am I going to do when it’s gone?</em> And they knew exactly what I meant because they had either felt it themselves or read about it in great works of Christian<a id="GBS.0083.05"/> theology. St. Augustine called it “the sweetness.” Thomas Aquinas called it something mystical like “the prophetic light.” But all said yes, it will go. The feelings will go. The sense of God’s presence will go. There will be no lasting proof that God exists. There will be no formula for how to get it back.</p>
<p class="para-p">But they offered me this small bit of certainty, and I clung to it. When the feelings<a id="GBS.0084.01"/> recede like the tides, they said, they will leave an imprint. I would somehow be marked by the presence of an unbidden God.</p>
<p class="para-p">It is not proof of anything. And it is nothing to boast about. It was simply a gift. I can’t reply to the thousands of emails with my own Five-Step Plan to Divine Health or series of powerful formulas, which guarantee results. I suppose I am like the man who wrote to me<a id="GBS.0084.02"/> to say he had seen a friend swinging from a tree and felt the presence of God in the same long, dark night. <em class="char-i">Yes.

He is asking me to employ a series of proven techniques that could help me reclaim my own health, if I would only try.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page124" title="124"/>
<p class="para-p">This is the problem, I suppose, with formulas. They are generic. But there<a id="GBS.0085.01"/> is nothing generic about a human life. When I was little, to get to my bus stop, I had to cross a field that had so much snow my parents fitted me with ski pants and knee-high thermal boots that were toasty to forty degrees below zero. I am excellent in the stern of a canoe, but I never got the hang of riding a bike with no hands. I have seen the northern lights because my parents always woke<a id="GBS.0085.02"/> up the whole house when the night sky was painted with color. I love the smell of clover and chamomile because my sister and I used to pick both on the way home from swimming lessons. I spent weeks of my childhood riding around on my bike saving drowning worms after a heavy rain. My hair is my favorite feature even though it’s too heavy for most ponytails, and I still can’t parallel park. There is<a id="GBS.0085.03"/> no life <em class="char-i">in general</em>. Each day has been a collection of trivial details—little intimacies and jokes and screw-ups and realizations. My problems can’t be solved by those formulas—those clichés—when my life was never generic to begin with. God may be universal, but I am not. I am Toban’s wife and Zach’s mom and Karen and Gerry’s daughter. I am here now, bolted in time and place, to the busy sounds<a id="GBS.0085.04"/> of a blond boy in dinosaur pajamas crashing into every piece of furniture.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page125" title="125"/>
<p class="para-p">“Who’s my baby?” I ask him.</p>
<p class="para-p">Zach is running long loops around the room and stopping at every ledge to run his car along it. He turns to me.</p>
<p class="para-p">“A boy?” he says hopefully.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Yes,” I say, scooping him into my arms. He tolerates my tight hug for a few breaths and then squirms his way out, laughing. “Yes.” I say. “But not just<a id="GBS.0085.05"/> any boy. You.”</p></div><div style="display:none;"><a id="GBS.0085.06"/></div></body></html>
