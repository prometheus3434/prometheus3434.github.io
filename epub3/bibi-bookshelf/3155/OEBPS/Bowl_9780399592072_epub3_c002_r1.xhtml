<p class="para-pf stickupcaps char-dropcap-DC cso_18-DC sans-dc" style="text-indent: 0;">M<span class="char-first cso_10"><span class="smallcaps">Y BODY HAD FAILED ME </span></span>before. I was twenty-eight and working on my dissertation, a book-length treatment of the prosperity gospel and the final step on my way to being a professor, when one afternoon my fingers suddenly slowed and then stopped at the keyboard. I had spent long hours at the computer, but nothing seemed to warrant this surreal limpness, which extended from<a id="GBS.0018.02"/> my shoulders to my fingertips. My arms had a limited battery life, able to hold things or write a letter one minute and then peter out the next. In the middle of a car ride, I would suddenly be unable to grip the steering wheel anymore. Shaking people’s hands was fast becoming the most awkward moment of any day. Oh, hello there. Don’t mind the fact that I don’t seem to be gripping your hand, but<a id="GBS.0018.03"/> that you are expertly moving my arm up and down.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page15" title="15"/>
<p class="para-p">By day, I had to make endless accommodations for the weakness in my arms in the way I answered email, graded papers, chopped ingredients for dinner, and went to the gym. I spent hours in the bathtub soaked in Epsom salts. I cried in the shower when I thought Toban was upstairs. Sometimes I gave up and put both arms in slings or braces and let them<a id="GBS.0018.04"/> hang there like the world’s most awkward conversation pieces. What can you do with only sporadic use of your arms? Life had become an obstacle course of things to be overcome to the sound of a ticking clock.</p>
<p class="para-p">But by night, when my research into prosperity churches came to life in healing revivals, church services, and interviews in the pews, my arms were not just a hindrance. They were an object<a id="GBS.0018.05"/> lesson. It wasn’t only that I couldn’t take notes nearly as well and I had to record things, only for them to be painstakingly transcribed later by voice dictation. But if you had seen me there, you would have witnessed a girl in double arm braces at a healing crusade swarmed by teachers, evangelists, healers, and prophets like moths to a flame. People wanted to see me pushed up to the stage to<a id="GBS.0019.01"/> be healed by a celebrated Man of God or brushed to the side with teams of women touching my arms, my back, my head, and laboring over me in prayer. Sometimes I received an invitation to a quiet room to go over a checklist of sins I might have committed that would have opened the door to the ministrations of demons with names like Python, Sitri, and Vassago. What or who, my helpers wanted to know,<a id="GBS.0019.02"/> was squeezing the life out of me? They took spiritual inventories, paging through my life and taking out events one by one for examination. Was this it? What darkness could God’s light expose?</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page16" title="16"/>
<p class="para-p">In a spiritual world in which healing is a divine right, illness is a symptom of unconfessed sin—a symptom of a lack of forgiveness, unfaithfulness, unexamined attitudes, or careless words. A suffering<a id="GBS.0019.03"/> believer is a puzzle to be solved. What had caused this to happen? As I walked around with slings or braces on my arms, I heard whispers and caught looks, some sympathetic, some disapproving, some gravely concerned. In the small church where I did most of my research, I knew I was loved. I was prayed for. I was ministered to. But when, week after week, I returned with the same droop in my arms and<a id="GBS.0019.04"/> weakness in my hands, I thought I saw their lips close and their arms cross, and I felt like faithlessness personified.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page17" title="17"/>
<p class="para-p">Over the next six months I visited more than thirty-five doctors to try to make sense of what was happening to me. My first appointment was disheartening.</p>
<p class="para-p">“I think your injury is…” The doctor paused, turning to the physician he had brought in for consultation. They shared a<a id="GBS.0019.05"/> long silence between them.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Well,” continued the other, “it can be common in women who share a certain size.”</p>
<p class="para-p">One of the doctors had been, unconsciously, miming the shape of breasts on his own chest for the last few seconds. I was ready to get to the end of this as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="para-p">“When a woman of your, um, proportions does too much yoga, then it can create certain kinds of injuries, nerve<a id="GBS.0020.01"/> entrapment in your chest here and here,” he said, pointing. “Which explains the numbness you’re feeling in your arms. So ease up on the yoga!” he said with a chuckle.</p>
<p class="para-p">I stuffed my paperwork into my backpack as quickly as possible and scooted out the door. I rarely do yoga, and I certainly was not—what’s the polite word here?—encumbered.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page18" title="18"/>
<p class="para-p">“That’s the third yoga injury we’ve seen like that this<a id="GBS.0020.02"/> week!” I heard one say to the other before I shut the door behind me. A veritable epidemic of well-endowed yogis.</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp-alt"><span class="char-first cso_10">I<span class="smallcaps"> WAS SAD AND ANGRY</span></span> in equal measure most of the time. I would be angry at my arms and then I’d start to cry. I was constantly stewing over daily advice from friends and strangers who spied my slings and warmly recommended that I get carpal tunnel surgery. And when I sat down to<a id="GBS.0020.03"/> work, I usually worried that my frustrated crying was going to short-circuit my laptop. There was nothing close to strength left in my arms, and I had a three-hundred-page dissertation to write. Every day I tried voice dictation software, but it skipped all over the paragraph and garbled most of the words. “Prosperity gospel” always read “perspiring gospel” but “THIS COMPUTER IS RUINING MY LIFE!”<a id="GBS.0020.04"/> always seemed to come out perfectly. Eventually my creeping depression convinced Toban and my mother and father that I should move back home to Canada for a month so my professor parents could pretend they didn’t have jobs and help me full-time. And they did—they took the dissertation down by dictation. Word for word. I sat on the couch surrounded by books and tried to arrange my ideas into sentences,<a id="GBS.0020.05"/> and my mom or dad sat across from me pretending that each thought was riveting. Apart from that, we watched <em class="char-i">Law &amp; Order</em> episodes and ate Chinese takeout.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page19" title="19"/>
<p class="para-p">My body was failing me, failing all of us. Pain rippled through my limp arms. I was no longer proof of anything that testified to the glory of God, at least not in the eyes of the people around me. I was nothing like a sign and a wonder. Instead,<a id="GBS.0021.01"/> I was living in my parents’ basement, and I simmered with resentment. Wasn’t I better than this? “I used to be shiny,” I said to a friend with a sour laugh. “I really was pretty shiny at one point.”</p>
<p class="para-p">If you ask people in the prosperity movement how they know their lives are headed in the right direction, they talk a lot about proof. The lame will walk. The blind will see. Bills will be paid. Wives<a id="GBS.0021.02"/> will drive gleaming cars. Children will put on neatly pressed clothes with the price tags still popping out of their collars, all evidence of who God loves. It was even the theme song for prosperity teacher Frederick Price’s television show—“Evidence! Evidence! Do you need it?” sang the choir. The gospel would prove itself. But I longed to prove it too.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page20" title="20"/>
<p class="para-p">There is something so American about the<a id="GBS.0021.03"/> “show-and-tell” of our daily lives. A big house means you work hard. A pretty wife means you must be rich. A subscription to <em class="char-i">The New York Times</em> shows you must be smart. And when you’re not sure, there will always be bumper stickers to point out who has the honor roll student and who finished a marathon. America likes its shopping malls big and its churches even bigger, and every Starbucks in every<a id="GBS.0021.04"/> lobby proves that Jesus cares about brewing the best.</p>
<p class="para-p">Sometimes I saw this idea under the banner of family values. It was in the way women boasted about their fat-cheeked babies and their little boys in bow ties. It was in the way the pastor displayed his wife and child in the front row and asked his little Jennifer to sing the solo: “Isn’t she talented, folks?” It was in the way people bought<a id="GBS.0021.05"/> tidy mansions with extra guest rooms in case a refugee sponsored by the church needed to stay a night. Christmas cards were prosperity gospels writ miniature, stacks of pictures of a family in matching denim sitting on lightly distressed couches in fields of waving wheat. Does every field in America have a photo couch? But I was taken with the white light brightening their smiles as they turned<a id="GBS.0022.01"/> to each other and laughed. They were the good news.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page21" title="21"/>
<p class="para-p">Some bodies can’t bear up under this regime of divine perfection. A friend of mine looked at his newborn daughter, dewy from birth, and could not acknowledge what he saw with his own eyes. She was plump and pink with the lightly hooded eyes of a perfect child, but a perfect child with Down syndrome. Despite all the love in his heart, or perhaps<a id="GBS.0022.02"/> because of it, he could not say those words aloud. Down syndrome. And that sliver of iron became a commitment never to proclaim, never to “negatively confess,” that his baby girl was anything less than typical. He began to believe that the God of all that is whole and complete would make his daughter so, even if it was not until Judgment Day, when Jesus came through the clouds.</p>
<p class="para-p">What would it<a id="GBS.0022.03"/> mean for Christians to give up that little piece of the American Dream that says, “You are limitless”? Everything is not possible. The mighty Kingdom of God is not yet here. What if <em class="char-i">rich</em> did not have to mean <em class="char-i">wealthy,</em> and <em class="char-i">whole</em> did not have to mean <em class="char-i">healed</em>? What if being people of “the gospel” meant that we are simply people with good news? God is here. We are loved. It is enough.</p>
<p class="para-p">I received this<a id="GBS.0022.04"/> friend’s Christmas card in the mail not long after his daughter was born and stared at it on the fridge. The sun shone behind their heads, upturned in laughter, the baby on his lap, a gaggle of children hanging off of their mother. I exhaled slowly. I suddenly longed to have the strength to pick that baby up and hold her eye to eye, so I could say the words that I longed to hear: “You are perfect,<a id="GBS.0022.05"/> my darling, just as you are. You are the gospel.”</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page22" title="22"/>
<p class="para-sp"><span class="char-first cso_10">T<span class="smallcaps">HAT WAS THE </span>C<span class="smallcaps">HRISTMAS </span></span>when I sat across from yet another doctor, a small man leaning into a desk littered with papers, who made it quite clear that he was terribly important and, as far as I was concerned, the final word. He asked me questions, but mostly he seemed preoccupied by the sheer number of doctors I’d seen. He sounded skeptical,<a id="GBS.0023.01"/> as if all those doctors should have amounted to a cause already.</p>
<p class="para-p">“I believe that your symptoms are psychosomatic. So all I can recommend is a good psychologist,” he said firmly.</p>
<p class="para-p">“You think these are invented symptoms resulting from mental problems?” I asked in astonishment. “My arms stopped working because I used them too much while writing my dissertation, and now we just have to figure out<a id="GBS.0023.02"/> why.”</p>
<p class="para-p">I steamed. He might have been describing a complicated psychosomatic disorder that I have seen with my own eyes. A father dies and suddenly his daughter cannot move her legs. A schoolchild is petrified and suddenly feels his throat close up, unable to squeak out a word. It can happen and it can last for months, years. But I don’t think that’s what he was seeing. He saw an insignificant<a id="GBS.0023.03"/> young woman with floppy arms unable to write, and I saw a doctor who refused to put his shoulder to this problem and help me. He was my final stop on the long list of doctors I had met, and I thought he was my best hope. Now all I could see were the adult braces on his teeth and the way his lips curled around them as he told me that the stress of dissertation writing had clearly gotten to me. He jotted<a id="GBS.0023.04"/> down in my file that I required psychological assistance. Now no one would take my physical condition seriously. <em class="char-i">Don’t help me. Nothing to see here.</em></p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page23" title="23"/>
<p class="para-p">I stormed out the door as quickly as possible to keep myself from crying and giving him another excuse to think I was unstable. I strode through the hallways until I was out of sight and then slumped down on the floor to call Chelsea. Chelsea and<a id="GBS.0023.05"/> I have spent most of our lives together, and she set in stone for me what it means to feel loved and understood. In high school she learned to forgive me for our time at the same childhood judo camp, where I accidentally became her sworn enemy by repeatedly flipping her over my eleven-year-old hip and asking her, while she was flat on her back, if she had had her Wheaties today. Long ago we realized<a id="GBS.0024.01"/> that everything that happens to one of us happens to both of us, so we treat our lives like a tandem bicycle. Where she goes, I go, but we both look a little ridiculous.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page24" title="24"/>
<p class="para-p">We both grew up with unlimited hope that life was fair. But that confidence began to crumble in our hands as our twenties wore on. I lost control of my body. She lost a marriage when her husband’s immigration visa didn’t come<a id="GBS.0024.02"/> through. Together, we lost faith in the whole concept of things being fair. Fair would insist that people wouldn’t have to use smiley or frowny stamps to grade their students’ final papers because the instructor’s arm was not capable of holding a pen (“This cheerful stamp conveys that this paper makes me feel [stamps page] extremely <span class="smallcaps char-sc">HAPPY</span> about your detailed thesis statement!”). Justice would<a id="GBS.0024.03"/> grant citizenship to tired immigrants who, as children, fled silently into the dark when gunshots and thick smoke filled the village air, children hoping that no one could hear the soft padding of their bare feet in the tall grasses. Fair would mean that life rewarded the good and punished the bad, or at least pretended to.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page25" title="25"/>
<p class="para-p">The prosperity gospel has a very simple way of explaining why life as<a id="GBS.0024.04"/> it is must be inherently just. As it is told, God established a set of principles that keep the world in order. Just as there are natural laws of gravity and thermodynamics, there are spiritual laws that steer the courses of lives and ensure that good things really do happen to good people. The Law of Confession activates the power of positive thoughts, drawing our desires out of the heavens and<a id="GBS.0024.05"/> into reality. The Law of Agreement allows two or more people to harness their spirituality corporately to create an answer to prayer. The Law of the Tithe supernaturally multiplies an offering of 10 percent gross income given to the church, often with a guaranteed tenfold or hundredfold return. The number of these spiritual laws depends on who is preaching. There are the Law of First Fruits and the<a id="GBS.0025.01"/> Law of Seed Faith and an entire Laws of Life book series by the televangelist Mike Murdock, advertised as people’s “favorite book outside the Bible.” It’s also the same premise as anything your aunt sent you about the Oprah-endorsed book <em class="char-i">The Secret</em>. (Spoiler alert: The secret is to think positively.)</p>
<p class="para-p">Spiritual laws offer an elegant solution to the problem of unfairness. They create a Newtonian<a id="GBS.0025.02"/> universe in which the chaos of the world seems reducible to simple cause and effect. The stories of people’s lives can be plotted by whether or not they follow the rules. In this world there is no such thing as undeserved pain. There is no word for tragedy.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page26" title="26"/>
<p class="para-p">There was a moment in the midst of my arm debacle when I thought I had found a way out of the seemingly endless cycle of hope and disappointment.<a id="GBS.0025.03"/> I had agreed to some kind of surgery, and while I was lying in the hospital bed, waiting to be wheeled in, the nurses ran through all the typical intake questions.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Is there any chance you’re pregnant?” one asked.</p>
<p class="para-p">“No, I’m afraid not,” I said, and looked at Toban for a hard minute. We had been hoping to start a family for several years. Each month came and went, marked only by discarded pregnancy<a id="GBS.0025.04"/> tests and a swelling silence between us about whether we were simply unlucky. Or worse. Surgery would delay the possibility of fertility treatments in what felt like a fading season.</p>
<p class="para-p">I returned to watching <em class="char-i">Law &amp; Order</em> on the television pegged to the hospital ceiling while Toban worked at his computer in the chair beside me. Then there was a squeal of delight and multiple gasps, and then what<a id="GBS.0025.05"/> felt like a dozen nurses pushed aside the curtain and stood over us.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Well, honey,” said one of them, “looks like you’re not going to be going into surgery today.” He looked at me knowingly until I could feel my eyes fill with tears and my heart start to race. But I couldn’t say the words.</p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page27" title="27"/>
<p class="para-p">“You’re pregnant!” he exclaimed, and all the nurses started clapping. Toban reached out and pulled me to<a id="GBS.0026.01"/> him, and we could hardly believe the delighted shrieks around us. I put my hand on my stomach. This was my miracle.</p>
<p class="para-p">We talked fast and giddy on the way home, as if the car had been pumped full of ether. We were overcome with love, love for each other, love for this baby, love for this future. By the time we had gotten home from the hospital, I had had some strong feelings about using my dad’s<a id="GBS.0026.02"/> middle name if it was a boy, and Toban was convinced that all the best girl names were taken. We were high on possibility. We dithered and fussed around the house, unable to fully concentrate on anything except when we were allowed to tell our parents.</p>
<p class="para-p">But it had already begun. I felt something strange and ran to the bathroom. I started to scream for Toban. As I sat crouched there, everything<a id="GBS.0026.03"/> moved around me in a blur. Toban with his arms around me. My stomach sore from deep, shaking sobs. My own rage at having fallen in love with this three-hour dream.</p>
<p class="para-p">When we had said all we could say and I had cried all I could cry, we stood there like fools, without language or focus. Toban finally left to make coffee, to have something to do and to hold in his hands, but I couldn’t bring myself<a id="GBS.0026.04"/> to leave the bathroom. I undressed and turned on the hot water of the shower. I stepped inside, pressed my cheek against the cool tile of the wall, and closed my eyes. I could not look down. I was nothing but blood and water.</p></div><div style="display:none;"><a id="GBS.0026.05"/></div></body></html>
