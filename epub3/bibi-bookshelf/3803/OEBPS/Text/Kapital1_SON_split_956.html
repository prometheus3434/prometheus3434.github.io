In the 8 years from 1853 to 1861, it had increased from the basis taken in 1853, 20 per cent! The fact is so astonishing as to be almost incredible ... this intoxicating augmentation of wealth and power ... entirely confined to classes of property ... must be of indirect benefit to the labouring population, because it cheapens the commodities of general consumption - while the rich have been growing richer, the poor have been growing less poor! at any rate, whether the extremes of poverty are less, I do not presume to say." (Gladstone in H.o.C. 16. April 1863. "Morning Star", 17. April.)</p>
