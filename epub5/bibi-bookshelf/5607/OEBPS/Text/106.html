  <p class="pFirst"><span class="drop_caps"><img alt="T" src="../Images/BD_Renaissance_T.png" /></span>he summer wind bore autumn's faintest chill as it snapped the castle's blue-and-gold pennants. The knights on the castle walls wearily stamped their feet, squinting across the Solamnic plains toward the southeast. Always the southeast. One bold squire had been heard to say that if an army came upon the keep from the northwest, it could knock down the wall and be taking tea in the outer ward before anyone noticed. On learning about the jest, the boy's master had sent him to muck out the stables for his loose tongue. Good humor had been scarce in the keep for some time: the coming war with the Highlords had seen to that. Still, Sir Edwin couldn't help glancing to the north-west with a grim smile as he emerged from the building that had once been the castle's chapel. That was before the Cataclysm, before the gods had turned their backs on the world. He shook his head as he marched up the stairs to the keep's high inner wall. The joke, he knew, had been harmless: though the knights were surrounded by the enemy, they knew there was no danger from the northwest. That wasn't where the bulk of their foe's army was concentrated.</p>

  <p class="pSecond">The southeast, however, was a different matter.</p>

  <p class="p62">Not that there was anything yet to see that way, either; the scouts had gauged the army at several days' march away, and Castle Archuran yet stood in the army's path. Still, there were dire rumors among the troops. Some even said the dragons had returned, darkening the skies with their wings as they had done in Huma's day.</p>

  <p class="p62">Most of the knights scoffed at this notion, but Edwin's face darkened as he considered it. His fellows put little stock in the old legends, but he had long believed, at risk of being branded a fool, that many of the tales were true. Edwin honored the memory of Huma Dragonbane, though few others did these days. If Huma was real, then so were the dragons&ndash; and where were they?</p>

  <p class="p62">Edwin wondered if the answer to that question mightn't come all too soon.</p>

  <p class="p21">He looked down the wall's crenelated length. At last he spotted the figure he sought, standing near the Southeast Tower. The man stood rigid, his back to the castle wall, his blue cloak whipping in the wind. The other knights gave him a wide berth as they paced the battlements, none pausing to exchange comradely greetings or banter with the down knight. Edwin sighed and started toward the knight, singing a few verses from an old Solamnic war song as he went:</p>

  <p class="p37"><span class="t21">To Hanford came the Hooded Knight,</span></p>

  <p class="p37"><span class="t21">With cloak of gold and steed of bay,</span></p>

  <p class="p37"><span class="t21">His sword a</span>&ndash;<span class="t21">flashing silver</span>&ndash;<span class="t21">bright,</span></p>

  <p class="p38"><span class="t21">A</span>&ndash;<span class="t21">thirsting for a wyrm to slay.</span></p>

  <p class="p37"><span class="t21">The Lord of Hanford welcomed him,</span></p>

  <p class="p37"><span class="t21">For woe and grief were his domain:</span></p>

  <p class="p37"><span class="t21">The dragon they named Angethrim</span></p>

  <p class="p38"><span class="t21">Had long since been the townsfolk's bane.</span></p>

  <p class="p37"><span class="t21">For many years the wyrm had flown,</span></p>

  <p class="p37"><span class="t21">His breath afire, his jaws oped wide,</span></p>

  <p class="p37"><span class="t21">Thrice monthly when the red moon shone;</span></p>

  <p class="p39"><span class="t21">Those few who stood against him died.</span></p>

  <p class="p62">Edwin had never been much of a singer, but what he lacked in talent he more than made up for with zeal. The other knights smiled and saluted as he passed. It did his heart good to see them cheered so, when grimness was the order of the day.</p>

  <p class="p62">There were many more verses to the song, and Edwin would have sung them all, but the dour knight silenced Edwin with a glance. That man was not cheered by the song; rather, he stiffened at the young knight's approach. Edwin stopped a respectful distance away.</p>

  <p class="p62">You do no one any favors, speaking of dragons so," the knight said. Edwin shrugged. "'Tis but a song, brother, to raise the men's spirits."</p>

  <p class="p62">"It sows fear," returned the knight. "Let the dragons remain children's stories."</p>

  <p class="p62">"But what if&ndash;" Edwin caught himself, but not in time. With a rattle of armor, the brooding knight turned away from the plains and glared angrily at Edwin.</p>

  <p class="p62">The young knight endured his brother's piercing gaze for a moment, then looked away.</p>

  <p class="p62">"You were about to say what if the rumors are true?" stated the older knight, his face drawn into a scowl, as usual.</p>

  <p class="p62">Edwin looked at him in surprise. "Yes, brother, I have considered it.</p>

  <p class="p62">" '<span class="t21">Rumors rarely blossom without the seed of truth,</span>' so the saying goes." The older knight glanced back at the barren plains. "But even if there are dragons among the foe, what good does it do to remind the men?</p>

  <p class="p62">They're nervous enough as it is. Putting dragons in their dreams only makes things worse, whether the dragons are real or fancy. I want an end to such nonsense!"</p>

  <p class="p62">Edwin bowed his head, stared fixedly at the flag-stones. "Yes, Derek," he said wearily. In his thirty years, he'd said those words more often than he could recall.</p>

  <p class="p62">Lord Derek Crownguard turned his head, then laid a gauntleted hand on Edwin's arm. "I don't mean to be harsh, brother," he said. "This war wears on us all, and I worry for the men's morale. Too much talk of dragons could break them." He paused, glancing up and down the wall to make sure none could hear. "Ofttimes, I wonder if Lord Gunthar's men haven't been spreading those stories with just that in mind." Edwin nodded, still staring past his brother. It was well known that there was more love between knights and goblins than between Derek Crownguard and Gunthar Uth Wistan. Both had long desired the coveted position of Lord Knight of the Knighthood, and the years of rivalry had built up a wall of stone between them.</p>

  <p class="p62">Their political maneuvering was like a great game of khas, a game that was a favorite with Derek. Edwin had never much cared for khas, or for politics, but he understood that with Castle Crownguard facing imminent siege and Lord Gunthar &ndash;the nominal head of the High Council&ndash; presumably safe on Sancrist Isle, Derek was on the verge of losing the game. Edwin had the unhappy feeling &ndash;though he tried to rid himself of it&ndash; that losing at politics meant more to Derek than losing his family's castle and possibly his own life.</p>

  <p class="p62">"Has there been word from Sancrist?" Edwin asked. Now it was Derek who looked away. His shoulders slumped slightly, though only Edwin saw this. The fury in the older knight's eyes, though, was plain to any who looked his way. "None," he snarled softly.</p>

  <p class="p62">"Gunthar must surely know our plight. He's holding back, hoping I will fail!"</p>

  <p class="p62">"You do him an injustice!" Edwin said. "How can you think that?" Derek looked at his brother sharply. There was no missing the unspoken accusation in the question: Derek would have done the same by Guntharif not worse&ndash; were the tables turned.</p>

  <p class="p62">"He would do anything to keep me from becoming Grand Master," Derek growled. "Even withhold reinforcements. But it won't work." He stared back at his castle, eyeing it as if it were a rook on a khas-board.</p>

  <p class="p62">"Mark me, the day will come when Gunthar rues all he's done to thwart me."</p>

  <p class="p62">They stood on the battlements together, neither saying more. Strangers were often amazed to discover that Derek and Edwin Crownguard were of the same blood. Derek was serious, dour and brooding, while Edwin's brow was clear, his eyes bright and guileless. "Naivet," some called behind his back.</p>

  <p class="p62">In olden times, it had been the custom that a lord's firstborn son became his heir. His second son, with no lands to inherit, often entered the priesthood. Of course, there had been no priesthood since the Cataclysm, but it was a standing joke among the knights that Edwin may as well have been a cleric. Besides believing the ancient tales, he spent much of his time in the old chapel, where &ndash;he claimed&ndash; he found inner peace.</p>

  <p class="p62">Derek scoffed at this notion. He would have never tolerated such behavior in anyone but his brother, and he had always hoped Edwin would grow out of it. Now, looking at Edwin &ndash;so blissfully free of the burdens lordship had placed on Derek&ndash; the older knight realized that Edwin would never change. And though some snickered at Edwin Crownguard and called him simple, Derek sometimes wondered if what others took for Edwin's naivete wasn't instead a clarity of vision Derek himself had never possessed.</p>

  <p class="p62">"Ho! Look to the plains!"</p>

  <p class="p62">The cry came from a young Knight of the Crown atop the tall Northeast Tower. He pointed afield. Derek, Edwin and the other knights turned and stared in shock. For a moment, all were silent, then one of the knights cursed softly.</p>

  <p class="p62">"Virkhus and his legions preserve us," Edwin whispered. His fingers touched Trumbrand, his ancient sword.</p>

  <p class="p19">Derek said nothing; he only stared toward the cloud-dotted horizon. In the distance, black and curling with the chill wind, a thick plume of smoke had begun to rise.</p>

  <p class="p20"><span class="t39">*****</span></p>

  <p class="p62">By midday, Castle Crownguard's inner ward was filled with refugees, most terrified beyond words. Eventually, the knights found a man not maddened by fear, and brought him to Derek in the keep's Great Hall.</p>

  <p class="p62">"Linbyr of Archester, a tanner," heralded Sir Winfrid, the seneschal. He motioned for a portly, balding man to enter the hall. Derek looked up from the great war table, with its map of Solamnia and markers representing the knights and the assumed locations of the Highlords armies. As he studied the peasant in the ruddy firelight, he twisted one tip of his long brown moustache between his fingers. Linbyr stared back scornfully.</p>

  <p class="p62">Unused to seeing such contempt in a mere commoner, Derek flushed with anger. "Don't stand there wasting my time! Out with it," he growled.</p>

  <p class="p62">"What ill befell you and your fellows?"</p>

  <p class="p62">Linbyr was grim. "What ill? I'll tell you, my lord," he said, his voice thick. "We trusted your kind to protect us, that's what ill." Derek half-rose, balling his hand into a fist, then checked himself. He couldn't let himself be baited; it was beneath him. Still, he spoke with enough rage to give Linbyr pause. "What do you mean by that?" Linbyr cleared his throat. "What I mean, my lord" &ndash;he sneered disdainfully&ndash; "is that the armies of the Dark Queen have sacked Archester."</p>

  <p class="p62">Derek scowled. "Impossible. Such a thing would never happen with Castle Archuran protecting&ndash;"</p>

  <p class="p62">"Castle Archuran has fallen as well."</p>

  <p class="p62">Derek was so shocked, he let the interruption pass. He caught his breath. "Lord Aurik?" he asked.</p>

  <p class="p62">"Slain, my lord, along with his men."</p>

  <p class="p62">Derek sat back in his seat. Lord Aurik had long been one of Derek's greatest political supporters. He had also been a friend, a formidable warrior, and an eminently honorable man. That he and Castle Archuran could have fallen was unthinkable. Derek had never heard of a siege so short. "What treachery wrought this?"</p>

  <p class="p62">"No treachery, my lord," said Linbyr. His voice had at least softened with compassion for the fallen knights, but this pity only further inflamed Derek's temper. "The armies overran the castle." Derek snorted. "In a thousand years, Castle Archuran's walls have never been breached, by siege or sorcery."</p>

  <p class="p62">"That's as may be," Linbyr said, "but they crumbled like clay before the dragons."</p>

  <p class="p62">Derek looked away, clenching his fist. So it had come true. Edwin's song had come true. He knew it was irrational, but he felt like laying the blame for the dragons on his brother.</p>

  <p class="p62">"Yes, my lord. Dragons," repeated Linbyr. "Out of the songs of old. The knights were too busy dying to defend our poor village." He shook his head. "And to think we believed they could keep us safe from harm." With that, and without asking leave, Linbyr turned and left the hall. Derek made no move to stop him.</p>

  <p class="p62">One word kept echoing in Derek's head. Dragons. Dragons had thrown down the walls of Castle Archuran, had slaughtered Aurik and his men, had dealt yet another blow to Derek's aspirations.</p>

  <p class="p62">Carefully, he reached out and plucked the marker representing Castle Archuran from the map.</p>

  <p class="p62">"My lord?"</p>

  <p class="p62">Derek looked up from the table and saw Sir Winfrid in the doorway. The old seneschal's face was drawn with worry.</p>

  <p class="p62">"Well? What is it?" Derek snapped, rather more harshly than he'd meant to.</p>

  <p class="p62">Winfrid was well used to his lord's temper, and if he was stung at all by Derek's curtness, he gave no indication. "A rider approaches from the northwest, my lord," he said. "His shield bears the Knight's Crest."</p>

  <p class="p62">Oddly, the first thought that occurred to Derek was that the joking squire had been wrong: the sentries were looking to the northwest, after all.</p>

  <p class="p62">"A messenger from Lord Gunthar, do you think?" he asked. Winfrid shrugged. "He nears the gates. The archers are standing at ready, my lord, lest it be a trick."</p>

  <p class="p62">"Good," Derek said. "Let's see what this is about." He followed Winfrid out of the hall and across the inner ward. Edwin was there, fussing over one of the villagers, a young woman with a bloodied leg.</p>

  <p class="p62">Derek didn't spare him a second glance. Edwin had a knack for healing the sick and injured. He knew herb lore and how to set broken bones. People said his presence alone made them feel better. Derek thought it all nonsense. Neither his brother nor the frightened, exhausted villagers were foremost on his mind.</p>

  <p class="p62">He and Winfrid went into the gatehouse, then climbed up the watchtower stairs. At the top, bowmen crouched between the merlons, arrows nocked. Derek peered past them, down the road that led to the castle's stout gates. A rider was approaching at a gallop, and his gleaming shield bore the kingfisher, rose, sword and crown of the Solamnic Knights. His armor was swathed in hunting greens, hiding his identity. The rider, nearing the gates, reined in his frothing chestnut horse. He glanced behind him furtively, as if expecting pursuit, then tried to climb out of his saddle. His legs gave out, and he fell to the ground with a crash and a muffled curse.</p>

  <p class="p62">Derek watched the knight thrash on the ground. From the looks of him, the knight had seen hard fighting of late. That wasn't a surprise: the hills were rife with enemy outriders, and the roads were dangerous for a lone horseman to travel. The knight pushed himself to his knees, then yanked off his visored helm. A shock of red hair spilled onto his shoulders. The man's face was pale, and a thin trickle of dried blood had crusted on his chin, but there was a glint of laughter in his eyes as he gazed up at the watchtower.</p>

  <p class="p62">"Hail to you, old friend!" he called up to Derek. He broke into a coughing fit&ndash; he had plainly been riding hard for some time, and was winded. "A fine day for a ride in the countryside, what?" he wheezed when he found his breath. His red moustache curled above a toothy grin. Derek was amazed. The green cloak, the red hair, the irrepressible good humor: he knew only one such knight. "Aran?" he called as the man staggered to his feet.</p>

  <p class="p19">"The last I knew," returned the red-haired knight. He glanced behind again &ndash;it seemed more reflex than conscious action&ndash; then back up at the watchtower. "I don't suppose you'd mind raising the gates and letting me in?"</p>

  <p class="p20"><span class="t39">*****</span></p>

  <p class="p62">Derek descended to the bottom of the watchtower and started toward the castle gates. Two young squires preceded him to offer their assistance in helping Sir Aran Tallbow walk. Aran was doing his best to shoo them back. "Get away," he grumbled. "I've just ridden halfway across Solamnia. I can make it to the bleedin' courtyard on my own."</p>

  <p class="p62">"Take his horse," Derek ordered the squires. "See she's rubbed down, fed and watered. And brush the burdocks out of her mane." Nodding and bowing, the squires took the animal's reins from Aran and led the horse through the barbican into the inner ward.</p>

  <p class="p62">Aran Tallbow, Knight of the Crown, looked Derek up and down, then limped forward wearily. "It's good to see you again," he said, grinning despite his soreness from long hours in the saddle.</p>

  <p class="p62">Derek stepped forward and clasped Aran's arms, coming as close to smiling as he ever did. "It looks as if you've seen hard times," he said.</p>

  <p class="p62">Aran winced, grimaced. "Had a spot of bad luck near Owensburg," he said. "I ran afoul of a hobgoblin patrol &ndash;never seen so many of the buggers&ndash; and had to shoot my way through." He shrugged off the quiver he wore across his back and opened it; he was down to his last two arrows.</p>

  <p class="p62">"It was close, mark me. I rode old Byrnie hard the rest of the way. I was afraid I'd break her."</p>

  <p class="p62">"She'll be all right," Derek assured him. "But what brings you here in these troubled days? It seems an odd time to be calling on old friends."</p>

  <p class="p62">Aran chuckled, shouldering the quiver again. "That it does, but here I am. I was at Castle Uth Wistan when the messenger arrived with your call for reinforcements. I asked Gunthar if I might be sent here." Derek stepped back, rubbed his hands with pleasure. "Then Gunthar is sending help!"</p>

  <p class="p62">Aran's smile vanished. He scratched the back of his neck. "Well, not as such, I'm afraid. I'm all he could spare."</p>

  <p class="p62">"Damn him!" Derek spat, and struck the wall with his mailed fist. Metal rang against stone. "The fool! Doesn't he realize&ndash;" He stopped short, looking around to make sure none of his men had witnessed the outburst. Aran regarded his friend with concern, then smiled again. "I didn't say I was the only one coming," he said. "Before the Council withdrew, I cornered Alfred MarKenin and had a word in his ear. I told him how grateful you'd be, as Lord Knight, to those who helped you when you were in need. He agreed to send a company of Knights of the Sword, without Gunthar's knowledge. They'll arrive from Solanthus within the week, and you'll never guess who's leading them." Derek blinked, taking all this in as he swallowed his rage. "Not Brian Donner," he said.</p>

  <p class="p62">Aran flashed his broadest, most disarming smile. "All right, so you did guess." He clapped Derek on the back. "We three, together again, what?</p>

  <p class="p62">It'll be just like when we were young, newly dubbed and spoiling for a fight."</p>

  <p class="p62">Derek nodded. In his head, he was already sizing up the khas-board and contemplating his new strategy. "Thank you for this, Aran," he said.</p>

  <p class="p62">"It was no trouble, old friend," the red-haired knight returned. He glanced around the gatehouse. "Edwin around?"</p>

  <p class="p62">"He's in the inner ward. Seeing to those in need." Aran laughed. "Some things never change. Not that I'm surprised. Still dreaming of following in Huma's footsteps, is he? Well, maybe he'll have his chance."</p>

  <p class="p62">Derek frowned. "This is no time for jokes." Aran started to say that he hadn't been joking. The dour look on Derek's face silenced the knight.</p>

  <p class="p62">"I'm going to say hello," Aran said, turning to go. "Then I think I'll have a lie down. You wouldn't believe how I ache. I'm not as young as I used to be. We'll have a feast tonight, to welcome me, what?" Derek nodded, and Aran went into the castle. Though he was tired and sore, the red-haired knight still had a singular ease to his gait&ndash; the same ease he'd had many years ago, when they'd been questing-brothers with Brian Donner. Derek turned to dark thoughts. It had been a day full of bad news: first Linbyr's tale of dragons &ndash;unconfirmed as yet, he reminded himself&ndash; and now, at last, proof of Gunthar's refusal to reinforce Castle Crownguard.</p>

  <p class="p19">"So, you think you can win by leaving me undefended before the enemy," he whispered to the shadows. "You think you can sacrifice me like a cleric in a khas match. Pray you're right, Gunthar." He curled his fingers into a fist. "Pray you're right."</p>

  <p class="p20"><span class="t39">*****</span></p>

  <p class="p62">"I fear our hospitality is not what it used to be," said Edwin as Aran Tallbow helped himself to a slab of roast boar.</p>

  <p class="p62">Servants bustled about the Great Hall, keeping flagons filled with warm, dark beer. Bread, cheese and summer fruits lay scattered about the great dining table, scarce compared with peacetime feasts. Edwin gestured with his knife at the other knights who had assembled for the meal. "Most of us have grown accustomed to porridge and salt pork by now."</p>

  <p class="p62">Derek, who had hardly spoken since the first bread had been broken, glared at his brother. "Edwin, be still."</p>

  <p class="p62">Aran chuckled around a mouthful of meat. He quaffed his beer and shook his head, his red hair bouncing merrily. "No fear, Derek," he said lightly. "I've been through sieges before. At least you're not reduced to eating rat meat. Why I remember a time when&ndash;" He stopped. No one &ndash;except Edwin&ndash; was even politely pretending to listen. Aran glanced around the table and shook his head. No matter how he tried to brighten the mood, these men seemed determined to be gloomy. Well, they had every right&ndash; or so he was forced to admit. He'd looked at the map table before the feast. Castle Crownguard was all but surrounded. The hobgoblins that had caused Aran so much trouble were coming down from the north. And there was, by all accounts, a sizable army on the way from the south, an army that had razed Castle Archuran. Derek had learned that much from the peasants, before they'd set out to take their chances in the hills. He warned them that they were not likely to survive long in the wilderness, but they'd been adamant about not wanting to stay at the castle.</p>

  <p class="p62">What worried Aran most, though, was his host. Derek had always been serious &ndash;ill-humored, even&ndash; but now he was dark and ominous as a thundercloud. Aran wasn't looking forward to seeing the lightning strike.</p>

  <p class="p62">"How many knights can we expect to aid us, Sir Aran?" asked old Pax Garett, Knight of the Sword, who had been one of Derek's father's closest friends. He stroked his steel-gray moustache. "And when will they arrive?"</p>

  <p class="p62">Aran cleared his throat awkwardly, setting down his knife. "Um," he said, "twenty or thirty, provided they don't lose any on the way. And they'll be here in five or six days&ndash;again, assuming all goes well."</p>

  <p class="p62">"Twenty or thirty!" Pax returned, shocked. "Five or six days! By the Abyss, man, that's not enough! What does Gunthar think he's doing?"</p>

  <p class="p62">"Gunthar's doing nothing," Derek growled. All eyes turned to him. "He sits in his castle, hoarding his troops rather than committing them to the front."</p>

  <p class="p62">Aran shook his head. "Not so, my lord. Truth to tell, there are few knights left on Sancrist. Barely enough to hold the High Council. Most are fighting at Vingaard and Solanthus. Gunthar expressed his regret that he couldn't help&ndash;"</p>

  <p class="p62">"Bah!" Derek snarled. "He and his men are probably laughing at us even now! He's done this deliberately, to get us out of the way. To get me out of the way." His eyes gleamed in the hearthlight. "In fact, it wouldn't surprise me at all to hear he'd made a deal with the enemycast us to wolves, while he goes free!" All noise in the hall stopped. The knights stared at Derek in shock. Aran lowered his gaze to his plate.</p>

  <p class="p62">"Brother!" Edwin reprimanded. "You don't mean that!" Derek blinked, glancing around the room, then rubbed his anger-blotched forehead. "I'm sorry. I didn't mean that," he said wearily. "But Gunthar's left us virtually helpless to bear the brunt of the enemy forces."</p>

  <p class="p62">"There's little here for the enemy to be interested in&ndash; no offense, Derek," Aran responded. It was true enough. Whereas the Crownguard family had once been one of the most powerful in Solamnia, Lord Derek now had little domain. The family's prestige had long been in decline, and only years of careful, constant maneuvering had brought the seat of Lord Knight within Derek's grasp.</p>

  <p class="p62">But now even that was beginning to come apart, and the realization made Derek jab the table with the tip of his knife. "They will attack," he said.</p>

  <p class="p62">"But why?" demanded Aran. "What use is there? Even Lord Alfred wasn't sure why he should draw troops away from Solanthus to send to defend Crownguard, when the enemy can simply pass us by and attack rider targets."</p>

  <p class="p62">"They'll attack us," Derek replied, his gaze steady, "because they can win, and quickly."</p>

  <p class="p62">"They have dragons," Edwin added.</p>

  <p class="p62">This time, even the servants stopped and stared. Derek flashed a hot glare at his brother&ndash; he hadn't told the others of Linbyr's tale yet. Not that his telling was necessary; they'd all heard the rumors. This was the first time the news had been spoken aloud. Pax and the other knights looked stricken.</p>

  <p class="p62">Aran broke the silence with a hollow laugh. "Dragons! Oh, ho!" he cried, trying to pass it off as a joke. And, indeed, he did not believe it. "You've developed quite the wit, Edwin! Hasn't he, Derek?" The other knights weren't laughing. Aran glanced sharply at his old friend. "Hasn't he, Derek?" he repeated, more urgently. Derek poked at the cold meat on his plate. "My brother speaks aright, for all of his bluntness," he said harshly, taking a gulp of beer that tasted like dirty rain-water to him. "The dragons slew Aurik and his men, and leveled Castle Archuran. One and all the survivors told the same tale."</p>

  <p class="p62">Aran blew a long sigh through his lips. He knew now why the quiet conversation that had buzzed at the table throughout the feast had been so forced and half-hearted. Now, at last, he realized how desperate Derek truly was. He laid his knife aside<br />
  &ndash;his appetite had fled him&ndash; and stared up at the rows of gleaming shields that hung high on the walls of the hall. Each bore the crest of a Crownguard, marked with the sigil of a Knight of the Rose. The Tallbows were a less noteworthy clan, but Aran understood the pride Derek took in his heritage. That heritage was doomed now, meaningless.</p>

  <p class="p62">"What's this, then?" rumbled Sir Pax, thumping his fist on the table.</p>

  <p class="p62">"Gloom in the face of honorable death? Surely these aren't Knights of Solamnia all about me, brooding over their flagons that they might face a dragon in worthy battle!"</p>

  <p class="p62">That cheered the other knights somewhat, but when the feast was done, they dispersed quickly, off to stand the night watch on the battlements. Before long, only Derek, Edwin, and Aran remained, sipping brandy at the map table.</p>

  <p class="p62">"How long before the armies arrive?" Aran asked at length, shaking his goblet so the golden brandy sloshed around its edges.</p>

  <p class="p62">"The villagers said the enemy drove them part of the way here, then withdrew near the Axewood," Derek answered, pointing to a small cluster of trees on the map. "Their supply wagons will have to catch up, but I suppose we'll sight them two days from the morrow."</p>

  <p class="p62">"Then Brian's company likely won't arrive in time," Aran said flatly.</p>

  <p class="p62">"We can't count on using anything more than we already have."</p>

  <p class="p62">"The defenses have been raised," added Edwin. "We'd be glad if you would command our archers."</p>

  <p class="p62">Aran nodded. "I was hoping you'd ask. I'd be honored. With your leave, Lord Derek, of course."</p>

  <p class="p62">Derek nodded and grunted absently. It went without saying that Aran, one of the finest archers in Solamnia, would lead the castle's bowmen. But Derek's mind was elsewhere. "What do you know of dragons, Aran?" he asked.</p>

  <p class="p62">"No more than you, I'm afraid&ndash; perhaps not even that much, at that. Just what the nursemaid told me when I was a lad," the red-haired knight replied. "They're big, scaly, scary, and they eat bad little boys for lunch."</p>

  <p class="p62">He chuckled, and Edwin smiled, but Derek continued to brood. Aran sighed and shook his head. He swirled the brandy in the glass. Brandy sloshed onto his fingers. "Confound it, Derek! What do you want me to say? I didn't even know they existed before tonight. I certainly don't know how to kill one of the blasted beasts! Huma needed the dragonlance, if you believe the stories. You don't have any of those lying about in the armory, I trust?"</p>

  <p class="p62">Derek glared at him, didn't respond. Aran scowled and sucked brandy from his knuckles.</p>

  <p class="p62">"The Hooded Knight only needed his sword," Edwin said quietly.</p>

  <p class="p62">"Damn it, both of you!" Derek yelled suddenly. "The Hooded Knight is a fairy story! And so is Huma!"</p>

  <p class="p62">"And what are the dragons, brother?" Edwin asked. "Fairy story? Real? You're not so sure anymore, are you?"</p>

  <p class="p62">Aran had heard this argument before, many times. Edwin believed the old stories. His heroes were Huma and Vinas Solamnus and Berthel Brightblade. Derek had always ridiculed his brother for this. Derek believed only in himself. Aran knew the argument could last long into the night. He opted for a strategic retreat.</p>

  <p class="p62">"I'm afraid the ride here wore me out," Aran said, and feigned a yawn.</p>

  <p class="p62">"I'll retire now, by your leave, my lord."</p>

  <p class="p19">Derek waved him away, his flinty gaze still on Edwin. Aran made an apologetic face at the younger knight, then rose and left. He shut the door as quietly as possible, but it still boomed like a thunderbolt in the cavernous silence.</p>

  <p class="p20"><span class="t39">*****</span></p>

  <p class="p62">After Aran's departure, the two brothers sat in stony silence. Edwin endured his brother's glare as long as he could, then looked down at his hands, folded in his lap. "I-I'm sorry, Derek. I didn't mean&ndash;"</p>

  <p class="p62">"Yes, you did," Derek said coldly. "I'm a fool for not believing every song a bard ever played. Is that it?"</p>

  <p class="p62">Edwin cringed. "Brother, please..."</p>

  <p class="p62">"No, no." Derek sneered, waving his hand. "You're right, of course. There are dragons among the enemy. You'd best run along, find the Hammer of Kharas and forge yourself some lances, so you can save the world."</p>

  <p class="p62">"Stop it, Derek!" Edwin pushed his chair back and stood, his finger shaking as he pointed at his brother. "I've had enough of your mockery. I'm not a child any more. I don't want to be Huma, Derek. I just want to believe in something. Can't you see that?"</p>

  <p class="p62">Derek stared at Edwin, his eyes dark, his hands balling into fists under the table. This time, though, Edwin met his brother's glower with defiance. Derek's gaze turned to glittering ice, and he shook his head.</p>

  <p class="p62">"Very well, believe in something," he said. "Believe in the dragons. And, since they're coming, we must send a man on to Vingaard to warn the knights there."</p>

  <p class="p62">"Aye, that's good thinking," Edwin agreed. He stopped suddenly as he realized what his brother was saying. "No, Derek. Surely you wouldn't&ndash;"</p>

  <p class="p62">"I mean it, Edwin. I want you to go."</p>

  <p class="p62">"But this is my home! I can't just leave&ndash;"</p>

  <p class="p62">"If the dragons come, you'll have no home," Derek continued. "We will die, one and all, like they did at Castle Archuran. The Crownguard name must not fall. You have a wife, safe in Vingaard. I do not. You must sire an heir, so the family may carry on." He paused, his lips becoming a firm line. "And you must go before Lord Gunthar and accuse him of having part in my death, and those of my men."</p>

  <p class="p62">Edwin slammed his fist on the table. "So that's what this is truly about!" he yelled, his trembling voice ringing all the way up to the rafters. "If you can't be Lord Knight, you mean to shame Gunthar out of it as well! You've played this damned game for power so long, you can't see anything else! Not even your own honor!"</p>

  <p class="p62">Derek was not accustomed to such defiance. He stared at his brother in amazement.</p>

  <p class="p62">"Send another lackey on your errand, brother," Edwin continued. In thirty years, he had never spoken to his brother with such anger. "I won't be a pawn on your khas-board." With that, he turned and left. Derek stared after him until the fire in the hearth began to gutter out. If only it were as simple as Edwin imagined, he said to himself. How fine it would be if Paladine would drop by and save the day. But Paladine wasn't coming. Not now. Not ever.</p>

  <p class="p62">Gunthar's refusal to send reinforcements was all part of a plan, Derek decided finally. Gunthar had sapped the hope from Derek's men, turned Derek's brother against him, and consigned the Crownguard family to the ashes. All to keep Derek from ascending to his rightful place. Snarling, Derek hurled his crystal goblet against the wall. It trailed an arc of golden brandy behind it, before it smashed to flinders against the flagstones. Derek sat quietly, gazing intently at the glittering shards. He sat for hours.</p>

  <p class="p19">Plotting his next move.</p>

  <p class="p20"><span class="t39">*****</span></p>

  <p class="p62">By dawn the skies above Castle Crownguard were heavy with storm clouds the hue of unpolished armor. The lands to the southeast were hazy with approaching rain, and the wind had turned from vaguely chilly to damp and cold. The men on the walls clasped their halberds with shivering hands and lowered the visors of their helms against the slashing wind. No one sang now. Few spoke. The castle's scouts were reported missing. They had been due to return from patrol several hours before, but not even the sharpest-eyed sentry had yet seen any sign of them. With the storm coming and the enemy army not far behind, hopes that they would ever be seen again dwindled hourly.</p>

  <p class="p62">By morning's end, rain lashed the castle walls, and some of the more callow squires were talking of following the folk of Archester into the hills. The knights quickly silenced such talk, but not even the harshest reprimands could lift the shadow of dread from the young men's eyes. Sir Winfrid ordered the watch at the postern gate doubled to prevent desertion, and the worst cowards were locked away to keep them from sowing fear throughout the keep.</p>

  <p class="p62">Derek was furious when he discovered the dissension, and took special note of each culprit's name&ndash; if, somehow, he was spared, he swore to bring up their cowardice before the High Council. None of them would ever be knights, if he had any say in the matter.</p>

  <p class="p62">That wasn't the worst of it, though. Derek had discovered that his brother had gone to the old chapel to hold vigil in the old custom. Some of the younger knights wanted to join him. It was sacrilegious folly, and Derek considered putting a stop to it. But Edwin's angry words from the night before still stung. Derek reluctantly left his brother to his fancy.</p>

  <p class="p62">Derek Crownguard was in a dark mood when he left the map table in the Great Hall to inspect the castle's defenses. At the top of the keep's high inner wall he found Aran Tallbow sitting alee of a wooden canopy, patiently whittling a shaft of wood. Aran's fine longbow rested beside him, its string covered to keep it dry. He looked up when he heard the rattle of Derek's armor.</p>

  <p class="p62">"A fine day to you, my lord," he said with a wry smile. Derek glowered. He did not return the greeting.</p>

  <p class="p62">"You don't need to make arrows, Aran," Derek said, crouching beneath the canopy and wiping rainwater from his face. "We've enough to last the winter, if needs be."</p>

  <p class="p62">Aran shrugged. "You know me, Derek. I'd sooner wear another knight's armor into battle than loose a shaft I didn't fletch myself." He stuck a green-dyed feather onto the arrow with a dab of glue from a clay pot.</p>

  <p class="p62">"Any word of the patrols?" he asked, plucking a second feather from his deerskin pouch.</p>

  <p class="p62">Derek shook his head. "Perhaps they sought shelter, to ride out the storm."</p>

  <p class="p62">Aran finished with a third feather, then started fitting a broad steel head onto the shaft. "You don't believe that," he said. He tapped the arrowhead to make sure it was secure, then eyed the finished shaft critically. "You've got bigger problems if this wind doesn't let up, though. Your archers won't be able to hit a blasted thing." Derek grunted. "Neither will theirs."</p>

  <p class="p62">"Small help that'll be when their siege ladders go up." Satisfied, Aran slid the finished arrow into his quiver, which was already half full. Without pause, he took up his knife and set to carving another shaft.</p>

  <p class="p62">"Seen Edwin lately?" "He's in the old chapel."</p>

  <p class="p62">"Praying to Blessed Paladine? I hope he gets an answer." Derek glared at the knight. Aran grinned. "You could try enjoying a joke now and again, my friend."</p>

  <p class="p62">Scowling, Derek shook his head and looked away. Aran had always been good at hitting close to the mark, be it with arrows or words. Derek had the awful feeling Edwin was praying to the old gods. That was the last thing he needed!</p>

  <p class="p62">Derek turned and gazed across the castle's inner ward. At the Great Hall, several servants scrambled to cover a window whose shutter had been torn free by the storm. Sir Pax and Sir Winfrid were deep in conversation near the Northeast Tower. A footman chased his cloak as the wind bore it across the courtyard.</p>

  <p class="p62">A dark shape appeared in the sky, plummeting toward the castle from the east. Derek caught his breath and touched Aran's arm. The red-haired knight stopped whittling and looked skyward.</p>

  <p class="p62">"What in the Abyss?" he asked, then his eyes widened. "By Huma, hammer and lance!"</p>

  <p class="p62">The object was &ndash;or once had been&ndash; a man.</p>

  <p class="p62">The body struck the keep's western wall with a sickening thud, and fell onto the roof of the granary. Several knights dragged the body down to the courtyard. By the time Derek and Aran arrived, the corpse lay out on the cobblestones, covered by Sir Winfrid's deep blue cloak. Aran cleared a path through the crowd, and Derek stepped up and pulled back the shroud.</p>

  <p class="p62">Derek looked on the body. It was one of the scouts &ndash;that much was sure from the garb&ndash; but the face was too battered to tell more. Numerous slashes had torn the man's flesh, as if he had been mauled by the claws of some animal. The slashes were long, deep. The talons that had made them must have been as sharp as spearheads.</p>

  <p class="p62">Despite his best efforts, Derek shuddered as he covered the body again.</p>

  <p class="p62">"Take him into the chapel," he said with forced calm. "Return to your posts."</p>

  <p class="p62">Reluctantly, the men began to disperse. Derek turned and marched toward the gatehouse.</p>

  <p class="p62">Sir Winfrid hurried to catch up. "My lord!" he called. Derek stopped and turned. "There was something else, my lord," the seneschal said, proffering a wet roll of parchment. "A message affixed to the body."</p>

  <p class="p24">Derek took the parchment without a word, then turned and walked into the gatehouse. Aran followed him. Once he and Aran were sheltered from the storm, Derek unrolled the message and held it up to catch the torchlight. The ink had run in the rain, and a smudge of blood marred one corner, but the words were still legible. To Derek's surprise, the script &ndash;written in a sure, flowing hand&ndash; was in fluent Solamnic:</p>

  <p class="p40"><span class="t21">To the lord of this castle:</span></p>

  <p class="p26"><span class="t21">Look on your own death. Surrender.</span></p>

  <p class="p41"><span class="t21">The Dark Lady.</span></p>

  <p class="p62">"Well, now," Aran said, with an awkward, forced smile, "that's that, what?"</p>

  <p class="p20"><span class="t39">*****</span></p>

  <p class="p62">It didn't take long for word to spread. The enemy was coming and given the choice between dragons and the hobgoblin patrols that roamed the surrounding hills, the servants, squires and footmen chose the latter. The knights at the postern gate held valiantly against the terrified men and women who sought to flee Castle Crownguard. In the end, Derek ordered the Knights to stand aside rather than risk a riot. By dusk, only the knights and a few brave commoners remained. And, while news of the Dark Lady's warning strengthened many knights' resolve, some of the younger ones were starting to lose their nerve.</p>

  <p class="p62">As night came on, the storm grew more fierce. The wind howled. The cloud-wracked sky blazed with lightning, and thunder shook the castle's very stones. Aran gave up working on his arrows in disgust and turned to polishing his sword. Derek stalked the inner wall, keeping the knights heartened. He found a few of them missing from their posts. He thought they had deserted.</p>

  <p class="p19">"My-my lord," said Sir Pax. "They've gone to the old chapel."</p>

  <p class="p20"><span class="t39">*****</span></p>

  <p class="p62">Edwin knelt within the chapel, his head bowed, his ancient sword Trumbrand clasped in his hands. The men had laid out the scout's shattered body on a bier. Edwin had never once moved, and if he saw the corpse, he gave no sign.</p>

  <p class="p62">The young knights crept forward, glancing nervously at one another. Edwin did not look up, did not even move as they knelt on either side of him. His eyes were closed, his breathing slow and deep, his lips parted slightly.</p>

  <p class="p62">"Give me a sign," he prayed, beseeching whatever powers might harken to his voice. "I am not afraid. I will do what you ask. Just give me a sign that I am not alone."</p>

  <p class="p62">Over and over he repeated his simple plea. The prayer filled his thoughts, staved off hunger and weariness, suffused him with peace and calm. He had come to the chapel often in his youth, when he could steal away for an hour or two without Derek noticing. He had knelt there, keeping vigil as Huma and Vinas and the Hooded Knight did in the tales. Sometimes, he had thought he had felt something, but he had never been sure. Now, he prayed more fervently than ever. Dragons&ndash; real dragonswere coming. But if dragons were real, that meant that Huma might have been real as well. And then, that meant &ndash;he trembled at the thought&ndash; that Paladine was real!</p>

  <p class="p62">"You must be tired, young man."</p>

  <p class="p62">Edwin caught his breath so suddenly, he nearly choked. He opened his eyes and stared in wonder. There was nothing there. He glanced to either side. The young knights who had joined him in his vigil dozed where they knelt.</p>

  <p class="p62">"I said, you must be tired, Edwin," said the voice again. The voice came from behind him. Wincing as he moved joints stiff from hours of motionlessness, Edwin half-turned to see who had joined him. Behind him stood Pax Garett, and there was compassion in the old knight's face. He rested a gauntleted hand on Edwin's shoulder and smiled kindly.</p>

  <p class="p62">"S-Sir Pax!" stammered Edwin. "Why have you come? Is something the matter?" He started to rise, his brow creased with worry, Trumbrand ready in his hand. "Are we under attack?"</p>

  <p class="p62">"No, no," Pax said. Gently but firmly, he pushed Edwin back down.</p>

  <p class="p62">"Nothing so bad as that. I just needed to get out of that accursed storm for a while." He glanced over his shoulder at the chapel's closed door. "And I had to speak with you, this night." He reached for a flask on his belt, unstopped it, and took a deep draught. Wiping his grizzled mouth, he handed the flask to Edwin. "It's only water, I fear," the elder knight said. "My old heart burns these days if I drink anything stronger."</p>

  <p class="p62">Edwin took the flask and drank thirstily. Knees creaking, Pax crouched down beside him.</p>

  <p class="p62">"Why have you come to see me?" Edwin asked. "Surely my brother&ndash;" Pax shook his head. "Your brother has enough to worry about." He fixed Edwin with a piercing gaze.</p>

  <p class="p62">"I knew, soon or late, this day would come," Pax said. "And," he added, his expression growing fond, "in a way, I'm glad it has. You were always special, Edwin. So few believe the tales these days. When I was a lad, there were some who scoffed, but they were few. Now, times have changed. Men think the stories are fancy, that Quivalen Soth and Rutger of Saddleway were just artful liars."</p>

  <p class="p62">Edwin nodded. He'd heard as much &ndash;from Derek and others&ndash; all his life.</p>

  <p class="p62">"Then . . . the tales . . . they are true?" he asked slowly, his voice hushed.</p>

  <p class="p62">Pax smiled, gave a short chuckle. "Who's to say?" he replied. "I wasn't around to see Huma take the field against She of Many Colors and None, or the Hooded Knight ride out to battle Angethrim. But then, I've never seen a dragon, either. Some of the tales may be false, some true, some both. What does it matter? All that's important is the believing. I could never make Derek understand that, but you" &ndash;Pax patted Edwin on the shoulder fondly&ndash;"you always knew. Keep believing, Edwin, and one day the bards might sing about you."</p>

  <p class="p62">Edwin's gauntleted hand reached out, grasped hold of the older man's.</p>

  <p class="p62">"What about you, Pax?" Edwin asked at length. "Will the bards sing about you?"</p>

  <p class="p62">Pax chuckled again, but his eyes were wistful. "I doubt it," he replied. "In the tales, there aren't many dragon-slayers who've seen eighty summers. But you never know, do you?" Wobbling slightly, he pushed himself back to his feet and laid his hand on Edwin's forehead.</p>

  <p class="p19">"Keep believing, young man," he said, and walked away. Edwin looked to the bier, toward where Paladine's altar had once stood. He was surprised to see the first gray light of dawn beginning to shine through the shutters on the narrow windows behind the bier. A loud, rattling cry sounded from the window, rousing the other young knights from their dazed slumber. Edwin caught his breath. The shutters had blown open. On the sill perched a kingfisher, its blue feathers glistening with rainwater, its head angling this way and that as it studied the knights. It opened its beak to utter its harsh call again, then it was gone, flying out the window with a flash of blue wings. Edwin nodded quietly to himself. "Thank you," he whispered, and smiled.</p>

  <p class="p20"><span class="t39">*****</span></p>

  <p class="p62">Morning came, a pale shadow. The knights watched and waited, most in hopeless despair. Even old Pax, who stood sword-in-hand near the Northeast Tower, looked weary and preoccupied. Once more, there was nothing to see upon the storm-lashed plains, hour upon hour. Gloomily, Derek told Aran things could scarcely get worse. Then at midday, the storm ceased.</p>

  <p class="p62">The wind slackened enough for Aran to take up his bow once more. The rain turned to drizzle, and the inky thunderheads gave way to brighter overcast. The knights peered edgily to the southeast, the tips of their halberds quivering, expecting to see the dark shapes of the foe's armies marching across the plains. Derek, who had come down to the inner ward to speak with Winfrid, touched his sword and eyed the sky warily. Aran, at the Southeast Tower, fitted an arrow onto his bowstring and waited. The chapel door opened. Edwin stepped out, blinking in the light. His armor, shield and sword gleamed in the muted daylight. Behind him, squinting like newborn rabbits leaving the warren for the first time, came five young knights. Derek turned and glowered at them.</p>

  <p class="p62">"I was right, Derek," Edwin said. The serenity in his voice made the older knight's scalp prickle. "I was right to believe the tales. Pax told me."</p>

  <p class="p62">Derek scowled. "What are you talking about?"</p>

  <p class="p62">"Paladine gave me a sign in the chapel last night," Edwin repeated. "I was right, Derek&ndash; I understand that now."</p>

  <p class="p62">"Stop this, Edwin," Derek snapped, irritated and embarrassed. "You're talking nonsense. Get those men back to their posts. I'll discipline them later."</p>

  <p class="p62">"But&ndash;"</p>

  <p class="p62">''Now, Edwin!" Derek shouted. He turned away. After a moment, he heard Edwin heave a quiet sigh and march off, the five young knights following.</p>

  <p class="p62">"What do you suppose that was about?" asked Sir Winfrid. Derek shrugged. "Maybe he fell asleep. It'd be just like Edwin not to know the difference between a dream and&ndash;" He stopped, seeing Winfrid's gaze shift. "What is it now?"</p>

  <p class="p62">"Your brother," Sir Winfrid answered. "He's going up into the Northeast Tower."</p>

  <p class="p62">Derek swore silently. He turned just in time to see Sir Pax step aside as Edwin and the five young knights &ndash;Edwin's knights, to all appearances&ndash; marched across the inner wall and entered the tall tower. They emerged at the top of the spire and raised their swords. The rest of the men watched, fascinated, as Edwin took his place beneath the Crownguard banner that flapped atop the tower.</p>

  <p class="p62">"The damned fool," Derek cried, Edwin raised Trumbrand to his lips and kissed its hilt.</p>

  <p class="p62">And a nightmare dropped through the clouds.</p>

  <p class="p62">The dragon was huge, almost half as long as Castle Crownguard was wide. Its scaly body, borne on tremendous, azure wings, gleamed like an enormous, flawed sapphire. Wickedly curving claws flashed. Eyes as red as the fires of the Abyss stared from its death mask face. Row upon row of swordlike fangs jutted from its gaping maw. Its great, serpentine tail trailed behind it.</p>

  <p class="p62">The knights dropped their weapons and fled.</p>

  <p class="p62">Sir Pax roared with fury as the younger men scattered, casting aside swords, halberds and shields to flee the monstrosity that glided over the castle. Fear, strong and otherworldly, swept down from the dragon, turning stalwart men's knees to water and their minds to thoughts of death. Only a few remained, among them ashen-faced Pax, and Aran, who watched the dragon with stunned amazement. In the courtyard, Winfrid was paralyzed by the wyrm's baleful gaze. And even Derek, who had never buckled to fear, who had, in his younger days, stood with Aran and Brian Donner against ogres, sorcerers and worse, quailed and froze beneath the waves of magical fear that crashed over Castle Crownguard. Only Edwin, standing with his men atop the North-east Tower, appeared to be unaffected. His back was straight, his stance firm. The dragon circled. Derek tried vainly to make his legs move. Half of him screamed to get out of the beast's sight; the other half wanted to charge up to the North-east Tower, to save his brother. Instead, Derek did nothing. Beside him, Sir Winfrid lost his own courage and bolted for the shelter of the gatehouse. Derek didn't notice. Finally, the wyrm pulled straight up, into the clouds, and vanished. Aran let out a tentative cheer. He fell silent as a horrific scream, loud as thunder, tore the air.</p>

  <p class="p24">Mouth gaping wide, its wings folded back, the dragon dove down like an arrow. It streaked straight toward the Northeast Tower. Toward Edwin. He watched it, unflinching. And then Derek heard something strange. Something he couldn't believe. His brother was singing!</p>

  <p class="p42"><span class="t21">To Hanford came the Hooded Knight,</span></p>

  <p class="p42"><span class="t21">With cloak of gold and steed of bay,</span></p>

  <p class="p42"><span class="t21">His sword a</span>&ndash;<span class="t21">flashing silver</span>&ndash;<span class="t21">bright,</span></p>

  <p class="p7"><span class="t21">A</span>&ndash;<span class="t21">thirsting for a wyrm to slay.</span></p>

  <p class="p62">Edwin raised his sword. The great blue dragon sucked in a breath. A bolt of lightning flashed.</p>

  <p class="p62">The levin-bolt struck Edwin's sword. Sparks leapt from his armor, showering all around. A brilliant flash blew Castle Crownguard's Northeast Tower apart.</p>

  <p class="p62">"Edwin!" Derek yelled, throwing an arm up to shield his eyes. He heard the dragon shrieking, flames crackling, flagstones raining down into the courtyard. Then all of these were drowned out by the roar of the tower crashing to the ground. A stone chip slashed across Derek's cheek, drawing blood, and he squinted furiously, willing his eyes to focus. He concentrated on a great blue blur&ndash; it had to be the dragon&ndash; as it soared above him and up toward the sky. The rush of air from its wings knocked Derek flat, sending him sprawling onto the cobbles. By the time he staggered back to his feet, the great blue blur was nowhere to be seen.</p>

  <p class="p62">All was quiet. The air stank of ozone.</p>

  <p class="p62">Derek stared up at the cloud rack. The dragon was gone, of that much he was sure, for the dragonawe no longer clutched at his heart. His gaze shifted to the ruins of the Northeast Tower.</p>

  <p class="p19">All that remained was a heap of rubble, much of it turned to glass by the lightning strike. Through the gap where the spire had stood, Derek could see the Solamnic plains. The Crownguard banner &ndash;Azur, a crown d'or&ndash; lay smoldering atop the heap.</p>

  <p class="p20"><span class="t39">*****</span></p>

  <p class="p62">Four of the young knights' bodies were found amid the rubble. The fifth, and Edwin, were still missing, and the knights continued to dig. Falling rubble had smashed through the slate roof of the Great Hall, crushing Derek's map table and all its carefully arrayed markers. Oddly, though, the old chapel, which had stood beneath the tower, was unscathed. The knights bore their slain brethren inside and arrayed them, mercifully swathed in white shrouds, beside the dead scout. They spoke no prayer, nor sang any hymns for the dead.</p>

  <p class="p62">Derek stood alone in the chapel in the dim half-light, his eyes on the bier. The thought that his brother was dead worked its way into his brain. Though they hadn't found the body, no one could have survived such a blast.</p>

  <p class="p62">Behind him, the chapel door creaked softly open. Derek didn't turn. Footsteps approached, and Derek recognized his visitor by the rattle of arrows in the man's quiver. "My fault, Aran," he said tonelessly. "I should have stopped him."</p>

  <p class="p62">Aran Tallbow had nothing to say to this. He shifted from one foot to the other, his armor clanking softly.</p>

  <p class="p62">Derek turned to face him. "You have news," Derek said flatly. "Out with it!"</p>

  <p class="p62">The red-haired knight shook his head. "Winfrid and I have assessed the damage. The walls are beyond repair. A well-ordered army could press through the breach within a day, whatever we did to block it."</p>

  <p class="p62">"Then it's over," Derek said, and sagged wearily against the bier.</p>

  <p class="p62">"Though the siege has not yet begun, Castle Crownguard has fallen." A knock fell on the chapel door. "Enter," Derek called. The door swung open, revealing Sir Winfrid, looking haggard. Like most of the knights, he was ashamed to remember his flight before the dragon.</p>

  <p class="p62">"They've found another one of the knights," Winfrid said. "Not Edwin," he added, seeing Derek's eyes spark. "A Sir Rogan Whitemantle, Knight of the Crown."</p>

  <p class="p62">"Whitemantle," echoed Derek. He tried to put a face to the name, but couldn't. "Have him brought in here</p>

  <p class="p19">with the others after they dig him out&ndash;" "But, my lord," Sir Winfrid said, "he still lives." Derek and Aran exchanged shocked glances, then ran for the door.</p>

  <p class="p20"><span class="t39">*****</span></p>

  <p class="p62">Sir Rogan was still alive, but whether that was good fortune was open to debate. His legs were crushed. His back was broken. His face was burned, his hair and moustaches scorched off the skin by the dragon's lightning breath. His head lolled weakly from one side to the other. Each breath came as a wet rattle, and blood welled on his seared lips.</p>

  <p class="p62">"He asked to speak with you, my lord," said one of the knights. Derek and Aran picked their way through the rubble, joining the small circle of knights who had stopped trying to patch the sundered walls long enough to comfort their dying fellow. "Sir Rogan," Derek said, crouching down. He wrinkled his nose at the stench of charred flesh. "I am here. What did you mean to tell me?"</p>

  <p class="p62">"My lord," Rogan wheezed. His wide, glazed eyes flicked toward Derek. His voice was no louder than a whisper, and Derek and Aran had to lean close to hear. "Your ... brother ..." He moaned. Aran quietly clasped the young knight's hand, then looked at Derek.</p>

  <p class="p62">Derek's face was flat, emotionless. "What about him?"</p>

  <p class="p62">"He stabbed the dragon... through... the neck," Rogan gasped. "He didn't let go... didn't let go..." He sucked an agonized breath through his teeth, squeezing his eyes shut. He didn't open them again.</p>

  <p class="p62">"Just before the tower... fell, I saw the... dragon flying away. He... Edwin... was still... holding on to... his... sword..."</p>

  <p class="p62">He let out a long, slow breath. His arm went limp, and his hand slipped from Aran's grasp.</p>

  <p class="p62">"Rest," Aran whispered, laying a hand on the dead knight's forehead. He looked up at Derek hopefully, but his friend's expression had not changed. "What do you think?"</p>

  <p class="p62">Derek shook his head. "Delirious."</p>

  <p class="p62">"Probably." Aran stroked his red moustache thoughtfully. "You're right, of course, Derek. Still..." He regarded Derek carefully.</p>

  <p class="p62">"No," Derek said, and there was no missing the finality in his tone.</p>

  <p class="p62">"My brother is dead, somewhere beneath this." He waved his hand at the blasted stones piled around them. "This isn't one of the old tales, Aran. Men don't fly away, clinging to swords stuck in dragons' throats. My brother believed those songs all his life, and they led to his death. I won't have him become another tale, based on the ravings of a dying man."</p>

  <p class="p62">Aran pursed his lips as if he meant to argue, but then he saw the fierce look in Derek's eyes, nodded, and lay Sir Rogan's hand on his stilled breast. "We can waste no more time in a fruitless search. This will be my brother's bier."</p>

  <p class="p19">Derek rose and brushed off his cloak. "Put this man in the chapel with the others," he bade, nodding at Rogan's body. "Then stop digging. Assemble the men." Glowering, he turned his back on the dead knight and walked away.</p>

  <p class="p20"><span class="t39">*****</span></p>

  <p class="p62">Two hours later, Castle Crownguard stood empty. Once mighty and impregnable, it was now just another smoldering ruin on the Solamnic countryside. The knights left behind what they could not carry on horseback, including the bodies of the scout, Edwin's five knights, and Sir Pax Garett.</p>

  <p class="p62">Derek had found the old veteran dead on the floor of his chambers. Some of the knights whispered that, unable to face his flight before the dragon, Pax had taken his life according to the old custom. Derek soon put a stop to that rumor. Pax had been an old man, and the dragon's otherworldly fear had simply finished what age had begun. His heart had burst, that was all.</p>

  <p class="p62">The ride west was slow and perilous. Aran rode ahead, on point guard, an arrow always nocked on his bowstring as he watched for signs of hobgoblin ambush. Sir Winfrid brought up the rear, his gaze flicking back toward the castle long after the wooded hills blocked it from view. All the knights eyed the skies nervously, watching for screaming blue death to descend upon them, but the sky remained clear as a summer's day, though the autumn chill in the wind seemed to have come to stay.</p>

  <p class="p62">Lord Derek hardly spoke a word, and the men let him be. He had, after all, lost brother, home and holdings in one stroke. Whatever black mood he was nursing, he had earned it. Still, one young Knight of the Crown who caught a glimpse of his lord's eyes during the ride remarked to his fellows that Derek's mien was not that of a man beset by rage or grief.</p>

  <p class="p62">"He looks," the knight observed, "more like a man at a khas table, thinking about his opponent's last move." The knight did not speak of what else he had seen, though: it wasn't right to speculate that the gleam in your lord's eyes might be that of nascent madness. As it happened, there was no hobgoblin ambush. The knights rode two days and nights along the Solanthus Road without seeing anything more threatening than a squirrel. Then, on the third day, Aran rode back to join the main party. The knights reached warily for swords and maces, but Aran waved them off. He pulled up before Derek as Sir Winfrid rode forward to join them.</p>

  <p class="p62">"What news?" Derek asked in a voice raspy from disuse.</p>

  <p class="p62">"A company of knights on the road ahead," Aran replied. "Brian Donner rides at the fore."</p>

  <p class="p19">"Our reinforcements," muttered Winfrid bitterly. Derek nodded, his lips tightening. "Ride on."</p>

  <p class="p20"><span class="t39">*****</span></p>

  <p class="p62">Soon after, the knights of Castle Crownguard met the company of Sir Brian Donner, Knight of the Sword. The reinforcements numbered no more than twenty, and Derek raved in impotent fury at the sight of how few men his call for aid had mustered.</p>

  <p class="p62">Not that it much mattered, he told himself, when he calmed down. They were too late to be of any use, anyway. Then he glanced at them again, and thought twice. Perhaps, he told himself, measuring up the khas table once more, they will be more useful than a whole regiment. He turned the thought over and over in his mind, and every time he considered it, his foul mood brightened just a bit. By the time Brian Donner hailed them and spurred his gray stallion ahead of his company to greet them, Derek Crownguard was feeling almost civil.</p>

  <p class="p62">"My friends!" called Sir Brian, his silver-shot, blond moustaches curling above a warm smile. "'Tis meet that we three should be together again."</p>

  <p class="p62">Aran rode up to Brian, and the pair clasped arms. Long ago, before Lord Kerwin Crownguard's death, Derek, Brian and Aran had quested together. They had seen more exploits than any could remember, until Derek had left to assume the mantle of lordship over his family's fief. The reunion robbed Aran of speech. Derek came forward next, and gripped Sir Brian's gauntleted hand. He might have even smiled, had Brian not frowned toward the men of Castle Crownguard and cleared his throat roughly.</p>

  <p class="p62">"But, why have you not awaited our arrival at your keep, my lord?" he asked.</p>

  <p class="p62">Aran looked away, his brow darkening. Derek announced proudly. "There is no need," he said. "We broke the siege, and I am now sending my men north to Vingaard Keep, to aid her defenders. I ask you to do the same."</p>

  <p class="p62">Sir Winfrid stared at Derek in shock. "M-My lord?" he stammered. Beside him, Aran's jaw went slack.</p>

  <p class="p62">Derek turned to look at the two, and Aran flinched at the sight of the peculiar glitter in Derek's cold, blue eyes. "I'm telling Sir Brian about our defeat of the enemy army and their dragons," Derek said. He turned back to Brian. "It was glorious! My men fought brilliantly, and finally the enemy disengaged. I suppose they decided Castle Crownguard wasn't worth the effort. They won't dare molest it again."</p>

  <p class="p62">"Derek..." whispered Aran.</p>

  <p class="p62">Derek turned in his saddle and stared piercingly at the red-haired knight. "What?" he demanded.</p>

  <p class="p62">Aran drew himself up in alarm&ndash; the glitter in Derek's eyes had turned into a blaze. "N-nothing," Aran murmured, cold dread gnawing at his stomach. "It will wait."</p>

  <p class="p62">"So you were victorious," Brian said. His eyes flicked nervously between Derek and Aran.</p>

  <p class="p62">"Aye!" Derek roared, swinging around again. "They ran from the sight of us! We broke their spirit, gave them reason to fear the Knights of Solamnia!"</p>

  <p class="p62">Brian nodded hesitantly. He glanced back at Derek's knights again. Some of them were acting restless. Derek's words had carried back to them.</p>

  <p class="p62">"What&ndash;" Brian began, then faltered.</p>

  <p class="p62">Derek looked at him sharply, and Aran glanced quickly away.</p>

  <p class="p62">"Wh-what became of Sir Edwin?" Brian asked. Derek's left eye twitched, just once. Brian tried not to notice.</p>

  <p class="p62">"Lost, in honorable battle, along with Sir Pax Garett," Derek answered hollowly. "They fought valiantly, but 'tis war, and men die. Perhaps," he added, his eyes narrowing to glinting slits, "they wouldn't have, if your men had reached us sooner."</p>

  <p class="p62">Brian flushed. "M-My lord, we've ridden as hard as we could&ndash;"</p>

  <p class="p19">"No, no, it isn't your fault, my friend," Derek said, and rested his gauntleted hand on Brian's shoulder. "It's Gunthar's. He has betrayed us, betrayed the whole Knighthood. His inaction cost us dearly, and he shall hear of it. You, Sir Brian, will travel with Aran and myself to Sancrist, where we will tell the High Council of my triumph and Lord Gunthar's deceit. Then," he added, his face splitting into a grin that made Aran shudder, "then I shall be Lord Knight!"</p>

  <p class="p20"><span class="t39">*****</span></p>

  <p class="p62">They rode on. When the road forked, the knights continued north, following Sir Winfrid. They did not speak of the battle of Castle Crownguard, then or ever. Except to tell how Edwin Crownguard, standing atop the Northeast Tower, had died defending his home. Derek, Aran and Brian turned south. When they were well away from the others, Brian could no longer contain the question that boiled within him. "My lord," he asked, "what truly happened at Castle Crownguard?" Derek turned slowly, his saddle creaking, and fixed Sir Brian with a glittering stare that could have bored through steel. "Victory," he said. "Glorious victory. And one day, the bards will sing of it." Brian glanced at Aran, who shook his head. The message in the knight's worried eyes was clear: Ask no more.</p>

  <p class="p62">Brian sucked pensively on his lower lip, then shrugged. "If that is your wish, my lord," he said, and looked back toward the dusty road. None of the three said anything more that day.</p>
