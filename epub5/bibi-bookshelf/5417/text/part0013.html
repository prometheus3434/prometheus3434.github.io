Children learn to live with those rules, but they never stop being confused and pained by them, for these rules block children’s emotional access to their parents. They are basically invisible—not heard, seen, and nurtured. Tragically, conversely, this set of rules allows the parents to have no boundaries with the children and to use and abuse them as they see fit. Sounds awful, doesn’t it?</span></p><p class="chapterHeadA"><span><span class="bold"><span>Where Is Daddy?</span></span></span></p><p class="paraNoIndent"><span>“Daddy, why didn’t you protect me? Where were you when I needed you? Why did you always have to stick up for Mom? What about me?”</span></p><p class="para"><span>These exclamations came from Marcy when we were doing an “empty chair” exercise in therapy. She imagined her father in the empty chair, and talked to him about the family and how it hurt her to be so alone and unloved. Her questions are among those commonly put to fathers by daughters of narcissistic mothers: Where were you?</span></p><p class="para"><span>From my research and experience, the answer is clear: Father is revolving around Mother like a planet around the sun. The narcissist needs to be married to a spouse who will allow her to be at the center of all the action. That is how it has to be if the marriage is to survive. In the family drama, the narcissist is the star, and her spouse takes a supporting role.</span></p><p class="para"><span>A man gets himself into this situation for many reasons, but for our discussion the most pertinent point is that he is the kind of person who accepts this behavior from his spouse and, most of the time, enables her. Perhaps he doesn’t always want to, but he does, because he has learned over time that this is what works with her. Because the father focuses on his wife, his pact with the mother can make him look narcissistic too. He is unable to attend to the needs of his daughter.</span></p><ul class="bulletList"><li class="listItem">“My father always jumped to do my mother’s bidding,” said forty-year-old Erica as she described her father’s role during her childhood. “Mom was the boss, and Dad centered his life on her. He actually worshipped the ground she walked on. We could be watching television and a commercial would come on about ice cream. Mom would say, ‘Wow, that looks good,’ and Dad would head to the garage to go to the store to get it. He jumps at her command. She uses this as control in her relationship. She picks the time, and many times it’s when he wouldn’t typically want to go anywhere or when he is watching football. If I confront her on this, she asks, ‘Does your father look unhappy?’”</li><li class="listItem">Danielle’s father used to blame her for every argument she and her mother had (and there were lots of them). “If we got into an argument about cleaning my room, for example, she would be extremely emotional, end up crying, and then Dad would step in and say, ‘Look what you’ve done. Look at how you made your mom feel!’ It always became something about <span class="italic"><span>her</span></span> rather than what was going on with <span class="italic"><span>me</span></span>.”</li><li class="listItem">Clair, 41, reports that her mother controlled the entire household, including but not limited to her father. When Mom didn’t talk to her, neither did Dad. “Mom was an alcoholic, often passed out on the couch when we got home from school. I wouldn’t say anything until I picked up the vibe in the house. My oldest brother finally got up the courage to tell Dad that Mom was drunk all the time. My brother looked up ‘drunk’ in the thesaurus and tried to make it sound better by using the word ‘inebriated,’ but Dad slapped him and said, ‘Don’t talk about your mother that way.’ He always defended her.”</li><li class="listItem">Carmen’s father’s role as his wife’s protector is paramount. “In some ways, his needs don’t matter either. I used to worry about that, but now I see that is what keeps them together. They need each other to play out their dysfunctional roles and survive emotionally in the world. I don’t really care if that’s what works for them, but it did affect me. What about me? Do I matter?” When Carmen was in recovery, she tried to talk to her mother about her upbringing. As soon as she had gotten out the words, Carmen’s father jumped in to defend her mother. Carmen felt doubly discounted. Then her mother added insult to injury by saying, “Isn’t he wonderful? He is the best husband anyone could ever have.” Carmen said, “The very thought that maybe this is about me—not her or her husband—would never cross either of their minds. They typically go on about how wonderful their marriage has been and how happy they are with each other. I somehow want to remind them about the many times that Dad secretly told me he wanted to run off with another woman. They just live in denial and pretend, pretend.”</li></ul><p class="para"><span>This unspoken agreement between parents who share a narcissistic nest is strong and impenetrable to anyone, but especially a daughter, who is seen as competition by the mother. Obviously, Carmen had gained insight from her significant recovery work, but even so, the pain of this memory still brought her to tears. Tragically, parental denial is what keeps the family together for better or worse, and many families do choose not to confront their problems even though they hurt their children. Someday Carmen will be able to tell this story and not feel the pain that was so present that day. Though she is unlikely to be able to change her parents’ relationship, she can lessen its effect on her and her life.</span></p><p class="para"><span>Modeling a healthy love relationship is one of the most important things that parents do. Children who grow up with an unhealthy model are more likely to have some difficulty with love relationships as adults. Children learn far more from what they see parents do than from anything parents preach to them. In part 2, we look at the love relationships of daughters of narcissistic mothers and discuss the many effects of unhealthy parental relationships.</span></p><p class="para"><span>The emotional health of daughters of narcissistic mothers is in effect sacrificed so that their father can keep the peace with his wife. A daughter’s first steps in recovery involve voicing the devastating feelings of vulnerability and helplessness this generates.</span></p><ul class="bulletList"><li class="listItem">Nineteen-year-old Kristin sadly reports, “I wonder why I was born, why did God give me to her when she didn’t want me? I remember thinking I can’t live through this, but I did. I don’t feel pretty, I have low self-esteem, and I can’t give myself credit for things. My dad loved me and tried to protect me, but he couldn’t really do it with Mom being so abusive. He had to do what she wanted to stay married to her.”</li><li class="listItem">Linda, 26, reported an interesting difference between the ways her biological father and her stepfather dealt with her mom. “My stepdad has to circle his life around her, and that keeps her and them happy. He listens to her moodiness and her whining, whereas my real dad was an alcoholic and drank to numb it all out.”</li></ul><p class="para"><span>Most daughters report that if they did have good relationships with their fathers, their mothers were intensely jealous of them. Candace tells a heartrending story about the period when her father was dying of Parkinson’s disease. “Daddy was lying on the bed in the hospital and I was lying next to him. It was truly the last hours of his life. Mom got mad that I was that close to him and asked me to move, and she then took my place next to Dad. It was sad to me because it felt like he was the only person who really loved me. Years later, we were chatting about family dynamics, and Mom informed me that she had to adjust the financial inheritance from Dad. She told me she gave me less than the other kids because I got so much from Dad when he was alive.”</span></p><ul class="bulletList"><li class="listItem">Paula’s father always wanted to carry her around. “I was a daddy’s girl. Mom would always say, ‘Put her down, let her walk,’ in an angry tone. I was only about three years old and my mom was angry with me for taking my dad’s attention. She wanted it all.”</li><li class="listItem">Wendy and her father bonded so well that she grew up to follow in his footsteps. She also kept herself far away from her mother. She relays this story: “Mom was so jealous of my relationship with Dad. He was a medical doctor and I was in med school too. I could relate to him better, and he had empathy.” Wendy has few points of connection with her mother and her mother’s life choices. “She was a housewife and didn’t understand the whole education thing. I used to like to go hunting and fishing with my dad, to hang out with him and talk to him. She hated that. She always said, ‘Go ask your dad; he is the smart one around here. He’s the one who’s buying you the BMW!’”</li></ul><p class="para"><span>Many girls discover that when alone with their fathers, they were able to connect on a different and deeper level and discover their father’s capacity to love them. Even in small doses, this kind of nurturing made a difference.</span></p><p class="chapterHeadA"><span><span class="bold"><span>What About the Brothers?</span></span></span></p><p class="paraNoIndent"><span>Boys seem to have a different kind of relationship with Mother. Just about every daughter of a narcissistic mother has reported to me that her brother or brothers were better liked and more favored than she or her sisters were. Daughters consistently report how hurtful this has been. Typically, the mother appears not to notice the imbalance, or if confronted, denies it, but it does make some sense. Her sons are not threatening to her in relation to the father as another girl or woman is, because the boys are not as much an extension of her as is a daughter.</span></p><p class="para"><span>An exception to this can occur when the brother gets married and brings a daughter-in-law into the equation, who can begin to feel the brunt of Mother’s jealousy. In Mom’s eyes, she’s a competitor and the two of them may compete for the son’s attention. His mother may have been the center of his life before, but his new bride steps into that role. Mother should take a backseat, which is virtually impossible for her. My heart always aches for the wives of men with narcissistic mothers. They don’t really know what they are getting into.</span></p><ul class="bulletList"><li class="listItem">Jillian’s brothers got special treatment, and at times it was quite inappropriate. Their mother “was seductive with them. She paraded around the house half-naked and when they were teenagers talked to them about how to be good lovers.”</li><li class="listItem">Lisa had five brothers who could do no wrong in Mother’s eyes. “She adored them. They worked on the farm, they bought her gifts, and she worshipped everything they bought for her. They catered to my mother, and she loved that. Even today, they would blame my father for the way Mom acted. They always stuck up for her and she for them. She really brainwashed them! Having sons on a farm was a big plus—girls were not as important. She even went to extremes to keep my brothers out of the service. She would say they were needed on the farm—anything to keep them from leaving. For me, on the other hand, she couldn’t wait until I grew up, got married, and moved away.”</li><li class="listItem">Mirabelle’s mother wrote a letter to her after visiting her for a few days. “I admire your brother Gerald, as he knows what it’s like to know God. Perhaps you’d like to know. And your brother Craig is such a good, hardworking family man. His children are the delight of the family. We always feel welcome in our sons’ homes. We don’t have to walk on eggshells or worry about what we say. It’s always a great time! Coming to your perfect house is such a strain, my dear! I must say that you take after your paternal grandmother.</li><li class="listItem">She always thought she was right! You seem to follow her path!” Mirabelle brought this letter to therapy. She was wondering what it all meant. “Why are my brothers favored so? What have I done wrong? What does she mean, ‘your perfect house’? Is she jealous of me? Why is she saying I take after the grandmother whom I detested and so did she? She is so hateful! God, it hurts! She doesn’t like my sister either. She recently started a letter to my sister with, ‘Dear Mandy…I only say “dear” because I carried you in my womb.’”</li><li class="listItem">Amelia had one brother who was the king to their mother. “He was two years older than I, and he was put on a pedestal—the trophy boy. Mom related to him and wanted attention from him. A lot of her energy went to him. In adulthood it became crazier, and he became really rich. If my sisters or I would invite her over, she would dump us if my brother had invited her over too.”</li><li class="listItem">For many, the playing field between brothers and sisters has never been level. Victoria reports, “My brother is 18 now. I basically raised him and I really love him. He calls me when he is in trouble or needs emotional support. But I have to say he got the preferential treatment from Mom. My brother makes C’s and she doesn’t care. If I made an A minus, it was a big deal. I got a scholarship to law school. It was expected of me. I always had curfews, but my brother did not. He can come in completely drunk and she doesn’t care—she’ll offer to make him breakfast. My brother got arrested this week outside a bar and she thought it was funny. He can drink and act crazy and she says, ‘Boys will be boys.’ He dates a Hooters waitress and that is okay, but she hates my medical school boyfriend. My mother constantly defends my brother and criticizes me.”</li><li class="listItem">Every Christmas throughout their childhood, Liz’s brother would get twice the number of presents she did. Furthermore, her mother tried to set up competition between the two siblings when the packages were counted. Guess who lost?</li></ul><p class="para"><span>It has been surprising to me that most of the daughters I have interviewed or treated have not felt intense resentment toward their brothers. Most of them are grateful that the brothers are getting some maternal attention even if they themselves did not receive it. Some, of course, do feel resentful, and that makes sense. It seems to help the daughter if her brothers can break out of their own denial to see the real problems between their mother and sister. The daughter can then feel some validation from her brother.</span></p><ul class="bulletList"><li class="listItem">Tara had never gotten a fair shake from either her father or brother. Both of them always blamed Tara for her difficult relationship with her mom. She was 45 years old when her brother finally said to her, “What in the world is wrong with you and Mom and your relationship since like…birth?” She had waited a long time, but finally felt validated. “He is now able to see there is a problem, and that means the world to me. It makes me feel less crazy.”</li></ul><p class="chapterHeadA"><span><span class="bold"><span>The Sisters Extreme</span></span></span></p><p class="paraNoIndent"><span>When two daughters are being raised by the same narcissistic mother, I found that, more times than not, they take on very different roles. Both girls internalize the same message that they are valued for what they do, rather than who they are, but they behave in opposite ways. One sister may internalize the message and say, “Okay, I will show you what I can do and how worthy I am” and become an overachiever and a perfectionist. The other sister may internalize this message of inferiority and give up, feeling that she can’t make the grade anyway; she becomes an underachiever or engages in some kind of lifelong self-sabotage. We will explore this phenomenon more in Part Two when we discuss life patterns of daughters of narcissistic mothers. The most important part of this to remember is that even though the external landscapes I describe seem like polar opposites, the <span class="italic"><span>internal</span></span> landscapes are strikingly similar. In other words, the lifestyles of the women may appear quite different, as the high-achieving daughter will look more successful on the outside, but on the inside, both sisters hear the same negative, internalized messages and struggle emotionally. If there is only one girl in the family, she tends to take one of the polar extremes and become either high-achieving or self-sabotaging.</span></p><p class="para"><span>What causes a daughter to take the high-achieving path versus the self-sabotaging path? I have wondered a lot about this. According to my clinical study, the high-achieving daughter usually had someone special in her life who gave her unconditional love and support, typically the father, an aunt, grandmother, or teacher. The self-sabotaging daughter either had no one to nurture her or had only limited access to an adult who served that role during her childhood.</span></p><p class="para"><span>My sister and I took extreme polar opposite paths, perhaps because, when my sister was very young, we moved away from our grandmother, who was a loving presence for me in my early years, offering encouragement and nurturing. My sister missed this special loving connection with our grandmother and has struggled more in certain areas of her life than I. But we have both definitely fought with the internal critical messages instilled in us.</span></p><p class="para"><span>Daughters of narcissistic mothers seem to relate to extremes in all aspects of their lives and seem overly tolerant of aberrant and unusual behavior, which of course their mothers often exhibited. I even thought at one point that the title of this book might be <span class="italic"><span>Women of Extremes.</span></span> A quick overview of what we have learned so far exhibits the extremes that daughters of narcissistic mothers have learned to live with:</span></p><ul class="bulletList"><li class="listItem">Narcissism itself causes a person to swing from grandiose feelings to deep depression, almost like bipolar disorder.</li><li class="listItem">As a spectrum disorder, narcissism can range from a few traits to a full-blown narcissistic personality disorder.</li><li class="listItem">Maternal narcissism takes the extreme of engulfing or ignoring.</li><li class="listItem">Daughters of narcissistic mothers seem to favor opposite ends of a continuum of life patterns, either success-oriented and high-achieving or self-sabotaging.</li><li class="listItem">Daughters’ relationships with men tend to be either codependent or dependent.</li></ul><p class="chapterHeadA"><span><span class="bold"><span>The Shiny Red Apple with the Worm Inside</span></span></span></p><p class="paraNoIndent"><span>Narcissistic families are disconnected emotionally. They may appear solid on the exterior, but authentic communication and connections between the members rarely take place because the parents in this family are focused on themselves. They expect the children to react to their needs, instead of the other way around, as in a healthy family. In this dysfunctional system, adults do not deal with real feelings, and therefore do not meet the emotional needs of the children.</span></p><p class="para"><span>In a healthy family, the parents are emotionally connected, happy with each other, in control of the family, and at the top of a hierarchy.<span class="centerImage"><span><a href="part0028.html#en_des_00003_00001"><sup class="calibre3">2</sup></a></span></span> Their job is to take care of the children, who look up to them for support and protection. The parents shine love down on the children and strive to meet their needs physically, emotionally, intellectually, and spiritually. A diagram of the healthy family, adapted from a structural family therapy model, looks like this:</span></p><p class="contentsentry"><span><img src="../images/00004.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre1"/></span></p><p class="caption"><span><span class="bold"><span>Healthy Family Model</span></span></span></p><p class="para"><span>In unhealthy families, this hierarchy becomes skewed, and the children end up taking care of the parents. In a family with a narcissistic mother, everybody attends to the mother, and other family members’ needs are not met. In the narcissistic family the mother is at the center of the system with the rest of the family revolving around her, like the planets revolving around the sun, as in this diagram, below:</span></p><p class="contentsentry"><span><img src="../images/00005.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre1"/></span></p><p class="caption"><span><span class="bold"><span>Family with Narcissistic Mother</span></span></span></p><p class="para"><span>The diagram displays Mother’s self-absorption and Father’s pact to take care of her. The unspoken rule in these families is that they do not discuss this dynamic and it becomes a family secret. In order to maintain the peace, the children have to keep quiet and not rock the boat. They fear abandonment, which causes them to mask their real feelings and pretend that everything is okay—a survival mechanism. In doing so, they do not learn to express or even be in touch with their feelings, and they are thus set up for many interpersonal difficulties later on in life.</span></p><p class="para"><span>When children can’t rely on their parents to meet their needs, they cannot develop a sense of safety, trust, or confidence. Trust is a colossal development issue. Without the learning of trust in our early years, we are set up to have a major handicap with believing in ourselves and feeling safe in intimate connections. Daughters who grew up in narcissistic families uniformly report a lack of confidence in their own decision making as well as difficulty with assuredness in their love relationships. In the recovery section of this book, we will examine what can be done about this void in development. It is important to understand, however, that resolving trust complications will be a lifelong recovery task.</span></p><p class="para"><span>Oftentimes when Mother is narcissistic, she may be able to do some of the earlier nurturing because she has control of the infant and small child and can mold the child to her wishes. But as the child grows older and develops a mind of her own, the mother loses control and no longer has the same kind of power. This causes the mother to begin her demeaning, critical behavior with the child, in hopes of regaining that control, which is crazy-making for the daughter. Even if she learned a modicum of trust as an infant, she begins to unlearn it as she grows older. As she makes natural, reasonable demands on her mother, who is unable to meet them, the mother becomes resentful and threatened, and projects her inadequacies onto the daughter. She begins to focus on the daughter’s failings, rather than on her own limited ability to parent effectively.</span></p><p class="para"><span>You may remember that the characteristics of the narcissistic mother in chapter 1 included a sense of entitlement. This means the narcissist thinks she deserves the best, the most important treatment, being the first in line, being treated with extraordinary efforts, and so on. It also means that her daughter will not be able to have a sense of entitlement, because there is never room for both. Adult feelings of entitlement are unhealthy and dysfunctional, yet as small, helpless, dependent children we are entitled to be cared for. Every child deserves to have someone in her life who is irrationally crazy about her! We gradually grow out of this entitlement and dependency and learn to take care of and rely on ourselves emotionally, which is a sign of stable mental health.</span></p><p class="para"><span>In order to take good care of ourselves as we move through life, girls need to develop sound boundaries between themselves and others. They also need to be able to state what they need in relationships. The daughter of a narcissistic mother does not get to do this, particularly if those needs interfere with what Mother wants. This then causes the daughter to repress her feelings and needs, deny herself, and learn to be fake. Without healthy boundaries, all relationships become skewed in some way.</span></p><p class="para"><span>Setting healthy boundaries requires direct statements and clear communication. Narcissistic families commonly have a skewed, ineffective communication style called “triangulation.” Instead of the mother talking to the daughter, the mother may express her thoughts and feelings—usually negative and criticizing—to another family member in the hope that he or she will tell the daughter. Then the mother can deny that she said it, although the message somehow got out there anyway. This triangulation in communication is passive-aggressive and is an expression of the sentiment “I will get you back, but not directly to your face.” Many families, unfortunately, communicate in this dysfunctional manner, but narcissistic families are the poster example.</span></p><p class="para"><span>In recovery you will learn to say it like it is. No more pretense, no more facade, no more inauthentic representations of ourselves.</span></p><p class="para"><span>Like a shiny red apple with a worm inside, the narcissistic family hides profound pain. To understand how these relationship dynamics set up the daughter to unconsciously create unhealthy life patterns, we have to discuss further the concern that the narcissistic family has about its image. “It’s all about Mom” and “It’s all about image” are its mottoes.</span></p></div></div></body></html>
