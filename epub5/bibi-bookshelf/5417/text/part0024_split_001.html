The next step for you to take toward this is to separate psychologically from Mother as an adult, so that you can grow your own internal emotional psyche. For when you grow your internal emotional being, you become resilient and strong. You can stand on your own. You can sustain yourself in the face of maternal deprivation, bear up under any negative litanies from your mother, and withstand criticism from anyone in the external environment. You will become a woman who can be around your mother and be away from her, and you will remain whole in both situations. This is the ability to be <span class="italic"><span>a part of and apart from</span></span> at the same time, all the while keeping in steady access a solid sense of self.</span></p><p class="chapterHeadA"><span><span class="bold"><span>Why Is Psychological Separation from Mother Important for Your Mental Health?</span></span></span></p><p class="paraNoIndent"><span>Individuation, a normal part of development, begins at about age two as a child begins to say “no” and “mine,” and continues throughout life as the child matures, develops her own wants, needs, and desires, and deliberately breaks away from her parents to form a healthy sense of self. Healthy parents allow this to happen gradually and naturally.</span></p><p class="para"><span>The individuation process is stunted for children of a narcissistic mother, because she has either engulfed or ignored them. An ignored child does not get her emotional needs met and cannot work on self and separation because she is still trying to fill up her own tank with Mother’s love. She keeps trying to merge with her mother like a small infant, trying to get Mother’s approval and attention. An engulfed child is discouraged from seeing herself as separate from her mother and from having individual needs, desires, thoughts, or feelings. Neither daughter’s emotional needs are met and each has difficulty in developing a sense of self. If you’ve grappled with issues of control over your own life and feelings, or you can’t enjoy your successes, you are struggling, like most daughters of narcissistic mothers, to separate and individuate. You are probably still searching for and developing the whole you.</span></p><p class="para"><span>For many years, at the times I felt overwhelmed, I had a favorite saying: “I’m too little for that.” I would find myself using it whenever I faced a big project or was up against a major life decision. One day it dawned on me that this was an unconscious expression of a much deeper reality. During a therapy session, while I was processing the breakup of a love relationship, my therapist innocently asked me why I had decided to stay in the house in which I’d lived with the man I was getting over. It seemed too big for just one person, so why did I not move and find my own smaller, more practical home that could be “just mine”? I remember feeling blank and numb, and responded, “I’m too little to move.” My therapist’s eyes glistened, and he smiled. I felt instantly defensive and annoyed, but he gently explained, “That’s the issue right there.”</span></p><p class="para"><span>I did feel “too little.” When you haven’t completed individuation with your mother, it leaves you unfinished and emotionally immature, a half person aspiring to become a whole person. If your emotional self has been stunted, it doesn’t grow in proportion to your physical, intellectual, and spiritual self. You have to heal in order to become whole.</span></p><p class="para"><span>Years ago, in times of stress, I would unconsciously recite the words “Oh, Mommy.” Thank goodness that impulse is gone, but I do remember how infantile and orphaned I felt. It makes me smile to write this today simply because I can acknowledge this and be grateful that I have grown beyond it.</span></p><p class="para"><span>Part of separating from your mother and childhood is ridding yourself of negative self-talk, such as, “I’m not good enough,” “I’m unlovable,” “I can’t trust myself.” Because you have internalized these messages, they speak to you now as your mother once did. Decide for yourself what those messages say, block them out, and override them. As you do this, you separate in a healthy way from your dysfunctional mother and her self-defeating belief system. You will recognize yourself as an individual woman.</span></p><ul class="bulletList"><li class="listItem">Gracie, 35, remembers her struggle to individuate with painful clarity. “It took me a long time to feel like a separate person from my mother. She merged into me and then it was all about her—no distance.”</li><li class="listItem">Marianne wants to be close to her family, but needs to maintain her hard-won sense of self. “I seem to do really well with my established sense of self until I get around my mother and the family and then it’s like I get sucked back into the old roles we all used to play. I want so badly to just be me even when I am around all of them.”</li></ul><p class="chapterHeadA"><span><span class="bold"><span>What Does Separation Mean, Exactly?</span></span></span></p><p class="paraNoIndent"><span>Psychological literature explains separation-individuation as defining a sense of self and as differentiation. Every person has to undertake individuation from her family of origin to grow up fully. Psychological separation is an internal process and has nothing to do with geographically separating from your mother or family of origin. According to renowned family therapist Dr. Murray Bowen, an adult can regard herself to be further along with her individuation process the more she (1) becomes less emotionally reactive to the family dynamics, (2) becomes more objective in observing the family dynamics, and (3) becomes aware of the “myths, images, distortions, and triangles” she had been blind to while growing up.<span class="centerImage"><span><a href="part0028.html#en_des_00009_00001"><sup class="calibre3">2</sup></a></span></span> As you undergo the acceptance and grief processes in the previous chapter, you can undertake these steps successfully. As Bowen states:</span></p><div class="chapterEpigraph"><p class="paraNoIndent"><span>The person who acquires a little ability at becoming an observer and at controlling some of his emotional reactiveness acquires an ability that is useful for life in all kinds of emotional snarls. Most of the time he can live his life, reacting with appropriate and natural emotional responses, but with the knowledge that at any time he can back out of the situation, slow down his reactiveness, and make observations that help him control himself and the situation.<span class="centerImage"><span><a href="part0028.html#en_des_00009_00002"><sup class="calibre3">3</sup></a></span></span></span></p></div><p class="chapterHeadA"><span><span class="bold"><span>How Do I Release Myself from the Mother Orbit?</span></span></span></p><p class="paraNoIndent"><span>Releasing yourself from orbiting around your mother is the only way to gain true mastery over your life choices and to become who you are meant to be. I take my clients through the following three steps when they are moving through this stage of development: (1) understand how your mother projects feelings onto you; (2) understand and cope with envy from your mother and others; and (3) eradicate negative internalized messages. Let’s go through them together on the following pages.</span></p><p class="chapterHeadB"><span>PROJECTION</span></p><p class="paraNoIndent"><span>Projection is best understood as a process by which a person takes her own emotions and sees them as coming from someone else, believing that the other person actually originated those emotions. People do this when they are not dealing with their own pain or inner conflicts and blame other people for their own turmoil. Daughters of narcissistic mothers are generally the scapegoats for their mothers’ projections, including fragile ego and self-loathing. The daughter doesn’t understand this hatred and internalizes it so that she feels that she is bad or not good enough. Because this begins for the daughter at such a young age, it feels normal and real.</span></p><p class="chapterHeadB"><span>COPING WITH MOTHER’S ENVY</span></p><p class="paraNoIndent"><span>Daughters of narcissistic mothers commonly feel their mothers’ envy. It’s time to recognize and understand it. Many people believe that to be envied would be a desirable, powerful experience, but in reality being envied, particularly by one’s own mother, is unnerving and awful. The daughter’s sense of self is canceled by disdain and criticism. Her goodness is questioned or labeled bad or made light of, which causes her to feel like “her reality as a person is obliterated.”<span class="centerImage"><span><a href="part0028.html#en_des_00009_00003"><sup class="calibre3">4</sup></a></span></span> As the daughter analyzes what her mother appears jealous about—her looks, achievements, material wealth, weight, personality, friends, husband or boyfriend, or relationship with her father or siblings—she comes to feel unworthy. It makes no sense to the daughter that her own mother would have these bad feelings about her, and therefore she believes something is wrong with her.</span></p><p class="para"><span>Daughters typically have a difficult time coming to terms with being envied and being able to discuss it openly. I believe this is because they don’t want to appear arrogant in even thinking that someone could envy them. We can discuss our being jealous of someone or something, but to say we think someone is envious of us sounds haughty, eh? Daughters of narcissistic mothers usually do not see their own goodness enough to recognize envy for what it is, but believe they have done something wrong once again. Well, for you this envy was very real, particularly if you can recall specific comments, criticisms, and judgments your mother made about you or about things you did. You might have tried to make sense of them before, but it is important for you now to write down any comments that felt like envy. Seeing them in black and white in your journal will help you recognize the distortions that came your way and created an awful feeling inside your very soul.</span></p><p class="para"><span>If you blamed yourself for these comments and tried to right what seemed to you to be a misunderstanding, your efforts no doubt failed, for it is impossible to mend a narcissist’s distorted sense of envy. Envy just allows the insecure mother to feel temporarily better about herself. When she envies and then criticizes and devalues you, she cancels you out of her life and in this way diminishes the threat to her fragile self-esteem. Envy is a powerful tool in the narcissist’s repertoire, and you have likely seen it in your mother’s interactions with other people. When she directs it at you, however, it creates a feeling of helplessness and painful self-doubt.</span></p><p class="para"><span>To release yourself from your confusion and see the envy for what it is, recognize your own goodness and strength. Do not be spiteful or retaliate with ugliness. The envy that is thrown your way does not belong to you, and you do not have to identify with it. You can be real and feel the hurt and the sadness but not attack back or seek revenge. Hang on to the good that is within you. Most daughters I have worked with are not vengeful, so you most likely are not either. Is it any wonder that Cinderella is the favorite fairy tale mentioned by daughters of narcissistic mothers?</span></p><p class="chapterHeadB"><span>ERADICATING NEGATIVE MESSAGES</span></p><p class="paraNoIndent"><span>To rid yourself of negative messages, first think about how you make a wide range of decisions. Do you base your choices on information that you trust? Is that information usually from a reliable source? Do you typically have data that tell you that this source is someone on whom you can rely, someone with the credentials to be giving you advice or assistance? Have you generally had a good experience with this person and been able to trust his or her perceptions, information, and knowledge? Does this reliable source mostly treat you with respect and care about how you feel? Most likely your answer to each of these questions is yes.</span></p><p class="para"><span>I ask you, then, Is it wise to take those internalized messages from childhood and believe them, since they came from someone who was not authentic, loving, or empathetic, who could not establish an intimate emotional bond with you, who projected her own feelings onto you, as she was not in touch with her own emotions, and who was also envious of you? Why would you allow this person to define who you are? Consider the source. Remind yourself of this as you take a pen or go to a computer and identify and record those negative messages. Write them down in one column, and in another column, write about why they are simply not true. In doing so, you are redefining what you believe to be true about yourself. Is it really true, for example, that you are not good enough? Who says? You only have to be good enough for you!</span></p><p class="para"><span>Once you have identified the negative messages and have answered back, saying why they are not correct, your next task is to remember to do this same exercise whenever a message pops up in your mind. This way you will erase the old and put in the new—each time one appears in your mind. It will take some practice, but eventually your persistence will pay off.</span></p><p class="para"><span>Even though working this recovery program will bring you success, if you have difficulty getting rid of your internalized messages and need additional assistance, this is another time in your recovery that a therapist using Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) could help you. You would take your specific negative messages to your therapist, who will likely ask you to put a traumatic memory with each message for the EMDR therapy to be effective.</span></p><p class="chapterHeadA"><span><span class="bold"><span>The Separation Criteria</span></span></span></p><p class="paraNoIndent"><span>How do you know when your real self has developed and has separated from orbiting with Mother?

This has been a painful thing in my life forever—my mother, sister, and some female friends showed envy and I always had to keep a tight lid on anything good or successful I was doing because I didn’t want to get their wrath. Now I understand it has nothing to do with me and I am able to be proud of myself and give myself credit. I can’t tell you how important this has been to my belief in myself. I always had to disparage myself to feel accepted and now I can just be me” (Annabel, 34).</li><li class="listItem">“It always seemed like if I made mistakes, I was more accepted by my mother. When I did well, she always had something bad to say. Or she would make comments about me getting too high on myself. This hurt so much. Now it doesn’t matter really what she says. I have worked so hard on individuating from her because I now know that she is not a reliable source to define me anymore. This finally makes sense” (Chloe, 62).</li><li class="listItem">Holly, whose mother is a minister, has forever felt pressured and “less than” because she did not choose her family’s religion as an adult. “After doing this recovery work, I find that when my mother sends me letters with scripture about what kind of wife I should be, I no longer ruminate for days and become undone. I am able to accept her beliefs as hers and also accept my own separate beliefs about my spirituality and lifestyle. It feels so neutral now. Like I am in control of my life.”</li><li class="listItem">“I used to cry for days after just talking to my mother on the phone. She always gave me messages about how I would never quite measure up and I took it so personally. Now I can see that she is not a reliable source.

I still think this is so very sad and it sucks, but I no longer take it on” (Josette, 39).</li></ul><p class="para"><span>Let’s move on to the next chapter, so we can focus more on you and your unique qualities as a truly deserving woman.</span></p></div></body></html>
