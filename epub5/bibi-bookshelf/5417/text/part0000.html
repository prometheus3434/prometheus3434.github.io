This easy to understand and useful volume guides women out of the trap of seeking acceptance to prove their self-worth. This clearly written book helps the reader identify the subtle presentations of narcissism and demonstrates through case examples how these traits in a mother can shape a woman’s perspective of herself, her world, and her relationships. Dr. McBride should be commended for her unique contribution to our understanding of this emotionally entangled family dynamic.”</span></p><p class="reviewPageSource"><span>—Monica Ramirez Basco, Ph.D., author of <span class="italic"><span>Never Good Enough: How to Use Perfection to Your Advantage without Letting It Ruin Your Life</span></span> and <span class="italic"><span>Getting Your Life Back: The Complete Guide to Recovery from Depression</span></span></span></p><p class="reviewPageText"><span>“Dr. McBride has broken new and exceptionally important ground in exploring a critical area in parenting.
