It has been stressful, but most importantly, a meaningful labor of love, and certainly a task one does not master in isolation. While a thank-you seems hardly enough, I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to the special people who accompanied me on this trek of passion.</span></p><p class="para"><span>First and foremost, my children and grandchildren: Nate and Paula, Meg and Dave, McKenzie, Isabella, Ken and Al. The love, patience, understanding, and encouragement of family can never be valued highly enough. I love you all so very much.</span></p><p class="para"><span>My agent, Susan Schulman: Your belief in me and this topic repeatedly amazed me. Your professionalism, kindness, hard work, and support will never be forgotten.</span></p><p class="para"><span>Leslie Meredith, senior editor at Free Press: A special gratitude for your keen editorial assistance, your acuity in understanding the sensitive material, and your sincere belief in the need for this book.</span></p><p class="para"><span>Donna Loffredo, editorial assistant at Free Press: Thank you, Donna, for your kind patience with my never-ending questions. I could always hear your warm smile over the phone lines!</span></p><p class="para"><span>Thanks to the staff at Free Press for the final phases of “spit and polish”! Jeanette Gingold and Edith Lewis, your copyediting work on the manuscript was not only detailed and brilliant, but so very respectful.</span></p><p class="para"><span>Beth Lieberman: Your editing expertise and ability to hang in there caused many days of gratitude. Thank you so much for everything.</span></p><p class="para"><span>Other professionals who assisted with initial editing, proposal work, ideas, and support: Schatzie, Dr. Doreen Orion, Colleen Hubbard, Liz Netzel, Jan Snyder, and Laura Bellotti. A special thanks to you all.</span></p><p class="para"><span>Professional colleagues who took time out of their busy schedules to be readers: Dr. Renee Richker, Dr. David Bolocofsky, and Linda Vaughan. How kind of each of you to offer your time and support, when I know you are all so busy. I am more than grateful for your professional input!</span></p><p class="para"><span>Dr. Jim Gregory, thank you so much for the health section consultation. Your time and kindness are greatly appreciated.</span></p><p class="para"><span>Chris Passerella, the Web site guru with Kitzmiller Design, you were and are so awesome. Thank you for all your time, technical work, and support.</span></p><p class="para"><span>Chris Segura, with Chris’ Computer Consulting, Inc., your computer assistance was always timely and helpful. Thanks for the formatting guidance at the eleventh hour. Your patience with my lack of computer sense was a gift.</span></p><p class="para"><span>A special thanks to the people who helped keep me organized and fixed those things that were falling down around me: Gretchen Byron, Carolina Dilullo, Helen Laxson, Marv Endes, Frank Martin, Linda Fangman, and Jessica Dennis.</span></p><p class="para"><span>Tama Kieves and Peg Blackmore: my inspiration and professional support system. You both rock with maternal kindness and blanket understanding.</span></p><p class="para"><span>My dear friends who gave support with love, smiles, hugs, and encouragement: Kay Brandt, Kate Heit, Jim Gronewold, Jim Vonderohe, the Saccomanno crew: Franklin (neighborhood smiles at dawn), Frank (from curmudgeons to Pollyannas and round and round), Gianna (superhero), and Anthony (you rock). E-hugs and thanks to my fifth-grade pal Jimmy Hirsch.</span></p><p class="para"><span>A special thank-you to Ethel Kloos-Fenn from Applied Research Consultants for initial research assistance. I love you and miss you, Ethel.</span></p><p class="para"><span>Thanks to my parents for teaching me about perseverance, good work ethic, and fighting for what you believe in. “Get back on the horse” had an impact!</span></p><p class="para"><span>And finally, a deeply felt thank-you is expressed to the remarkable clients and interviewees who gave time and emotional energy to share personal stories so that other people could be helped. I cannot name you, but you know who you are. This book could not have been written without you and your spirited, daring sense of courage.</span></p></div></div></body></html>
