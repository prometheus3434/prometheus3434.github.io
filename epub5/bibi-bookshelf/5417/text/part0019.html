We all pursue it and value it, and each one of us has her own version of how it feels to be in love.</span></p><p class="para"><span>It is common for daughters of narcissistic mothers to try to fill their emotional void and emptiness with inappropriate love relationships. Unfortunately, they often search in all the wrong places for the right partner to validate them. In this chapter, I’ll talk about something I call “distorted love.” As daughters of narcissistic mothers, many of us learn that love means <span class="italic"><span>what someone can do for you or what you can do for them</span></span>. Many women unconsciously choose their romantic partners based on this distorted meaning, which sets them up for dependent or codependent relationships—or no relationship at all. The dependent cares about what he can do for you and the codependent cares about what you can do for him. Having no relationship is a kind of giving up, or choosing to not enter the dance at all.</span></p><ul class="bulletList"><li class="listItem">Alexis, 25, is not sure she knows what to look for as she faces the challenge of searching for a romantic partner. She tells me, Mom doesn’t even use the word ‘love’ unless she is referring to a pair of shoes! Oh, I guess she does say she loves her cat. How am I supposed to know what love really means?”</li></ul><p class="para"><span>Dependent and codependent relationships are not healthy or satisfying connections and many times end up as failed or miserable entanglements. If the relationship ends, the daughter is at risk for repeating the pattern unless she enters recovery and learns to understand that her “relationship picker” has been damaged. The daughter often reenacts her relationship with her mother over and over in what is referred to in psychotherapy circles as “repetition compulsion”—a cycle of relationships that results in disappointment again and again. After their expectations and hopes have been dashed, many women choose isolation or no relationship at all.</span></p><p class="chapterHeadA"><span><span class="bold"><span>When the Relationship Ends</span></span></span></p><p class="paraNoIndent"><span>Whether the daughter of a narcissistic mother is abandoned by her partner or leaves him herself, she feels great shame for the failed relationship. No matter if this is the first one or a series of failures, her sense of not being good enough deepens. Her self-esteem is greatly affected by relationship failures. In our society, a woman can fail at business or finances, but failures in relationships are less acceptable. Having more than one divorce or failed love relationship feels like a curse or a gross affliction. A woman will feel guilt and shame, but shame will be the emotion she finds most difficult. Guilt is usually associated with a deed that can be forgiven, but shame encompasses her being, taking on an “all or nothing” quality, which has devastating consequences for mental health. Adult daughters of narcissistic mothers often refer to themselves as “damaged” or “damaged goods,” particularly after a series of failed love relationships. Underneath this shame is the feeling that they are unlovable.</span></p><ul class="bulletList"><li class="listItem">A beautiful client, Tyra, came to me after her second divorce. The epitome of beauty, intelligence, and charm, she reminds me of a petite china doll. But beneath her charming sweetness is a deep sense of sadness and unworthiness. She has recognized her past with a narcissistic mother, but now that her second husband has left her for another woman, she comes to therapy with this request: “Make me good enough!”</li><li class="listItem">Margo, 55, tells me, “I can hardly speak of this feeling of failure. I feel so damaged now. Who would ever want to even date me? How do you tell someone you have had more than two marriages? Do they not automatically think you are unhealthy or weird in some way? This is messed up and feels like it will never be better.”</li><li class="listItem">Summer reports, “If I want to feel immense pain and shame, I think about my relationship history. This will do me in. I usually try not to even think about it or even let it come into my conscious being. Talk about feeling unlovable!”</li><li class="listItem">“No kidding, listen to this,” says Karla when expressing her pain about relationships. “When I introduced my fiancé to my mother, she shook his hand and then said, ‘Good luck. Hope you do better than the last one did.’ How does one get over this shame of past failures in relationships?”</li></ul><p class="chapterHeadA"><span><span class="bold"><span>Why We Pick Who We Pick</span></span></span></p><p class="paraNoIndent"><span>Typically, the daughter of a narcissistic mother will choose a spouse who cannot meet her emotional needs. Even though our intuition will tell us in some way when something is not right for us, we tend to block it out if it isn’t saying what we want to hear. When the hope for love blossoms, we override the intuitive inner voice or gut feeling. Years of treating and interviewing daughters with maternal deprivation have shown me that we have a deep sense of intelligent intuition, but it seems to be accompanied by a special brand of “deafness.” In the desperate search for love that did not exist in her childhood, the daughter chooses not to pay attention to the red flags that may be waving. We do know. We just don’t listen. In recovery, you will learn better how to tune in to your innate intuitive direction and guidance.</span></p><p class="para"><span>You actually “choose” a partner largely on an unconscious level. As human beings we are attracted to the familiar. If you have not worked out unfinished business with your mother, you will likely find yourself with someone who re-creates that mother-daughter pattern of behavior. We also tend to pick partners who are on the same emotional level we are.</span></p><p class="para"><span>If you are dependent, you feel this way with your partner: I am going to lean on and be dependent on you. I see you as a person who can do a lot for me. You can take care of me. You have money, prestige, a good family and good job, you’re gorgeous, you look good on paper—you fit my list of criteria.</span></p><p class="para"><span>If you are codependent, you feel this way with your partner: I am going to take care of you to the exclusion of taking care of myself. I see you as someone I can feel needed by. You need me to nurture, take care of you, and be a mother to you. You need my love because you didn’t get that as a child, you need my direction—you need me and that makes me feel good.</span></p><p class="para"><span>Healthy relationships are based on an interdependency, where both partners move back and forth in the caretaking, but mostly operate as independent adults. This means that neither partner is dependent or codependent. In the dependent-codependent relationship, neither partner loves the other for who he or she is as a person—they act out roles and a distorted definition of love. An adult daughter of a narcissistic mother is often misguided in her choices by her unresolved neediness. Need-based relationships are usually unfulfilling because no one can satisfy all of an adult’s unmet childhood needs. But until the daughter addresses this empty void herself, she will expect that someone else can fill her with the feelings of worthiness, competence, and love that she lacks.</span></p><p class="para"><span>Many times the adult daughter will choose a partner who can’t meet even reasonable emotional needs because she unconsciously wants someone who cannot be emotionally intimate or vulnerable. This is what is familiar to her and what she feels is safe and predictable. Until she enters recovery, she is not especially in touch with her own feelings and therefore needs to partner with someone who is not “into” the feelings realm either.</span></p><p class="para"><span>When a daughter’s emotional and intimate needs are unmet, she can easily fall into the blame game, rather than own up to having chosen the wrong person. If this sounds familiar, be careful here: You do not want to fall into the narcissistic trap of viewing your partner as either good or bad. If you turn your idealized partner into a villain, you may then feel compelled to abandon him before he abandons you. Abandonment is a great fear because you felt abandoned. Your parents may have been there physically, but you felt emotionally abandoned. If you are dependent, it will be more difficult for you to leave the relationship. You might stay in an abusive or otherwise unwholesome partnership, feeling that you deserve no better. If you are abandoned by your partner, you might have an unusually difficult time recovering from the loss and rejection because it will trigger your past experience with Mother.</span></p><p class="chapterHeadA"><span><span class="bold"><span>The Codependent Relationship</span></span></span></p><p class="paraNoIndent"><span>Overachievers often, unconsciously, find men who need to be taken care of. They are attracted to the “what I can do for you” dynamic. The daughter lets her well-learned skills of taking care of Mom and all her needs make her into a caretaker for life. When she partners with a man whom she can take care of in some way, she feels in a familiar, emotionally safe situation. A man who is dependent on her won’t abandon her. In return for taking care of him, she hopes that he will in turn fill her void and emptiness. Of course, this never works, and what happens instead is: The more demanding, dependent, or immature the man is, the more he reminds her of her mother, who was extremely needy and had “entitlement” demands. She eventually feels resentment and anger and becomes overwhelmed. She runs around trying mightily to meet his needs in hopes of a return pass of the ball, but it never quite happens that way. She gets tired.</span></p><p class="para"><span>The adult daughter does not really trust the dependent partner or his capacity for intimacy, because she knows, at some level, that she chose him <span class="italic"><span>because</span></span> he is not capable of vulnerability or emotional intimacy. She has thwarted her need for validation and her hope for authentic, loving connection. He cannot love her for who she <span class="italic"><span>is</span></span>, and thus she is constantly frustrated and sad. She seeks love but cannot find it until she completes her recovery.</span></p><p class="para"><span>I use a basketball analogy in therapy to give a visual image of this couple. Imagine a basketball floor with a basket at each end and bleachers on the side of the floor. The codependent, usually high-achieving woman is running back and forth making all the baskets on both sides, while the partner is sitting in the bleachers watching and hoping she will win the game for them both. After a while, the woman gets exhausted, feels frustrated and resentful, and wants to stop. The partner in the bleachers might be content that someone else is doing all the work for him, but his self-esteem is getting no validation or elevation, as he is not doing his part for himself or his partner.</span></p><ul class="bulletList"><li class="listItem">Betsy made the most of the three-pointers in her marriage. “I have a high tolerance for deviant behavior. Codependency galore! I recognize it now. Looking back on my second husband, he was passive and nice, and I was willing to put up with anything because he was nice to me. I was more charismatic and more social, the breadwinner. He used me. He was narcissistic and had a narcissistic injury too. I kept busy and took care of everything. He got fired a lot because of verbal arguments with people. I always wrote his résumés and got his jobs for him. Looking back, I see that he didn’t recognize what I did for him. He put no effort into things. He never said the words ‘I’m sorry.’ I had a high tolerance for this; I blew it off and went on with life. My expectation of others seems to be low. In relationships, I am comfortable with 80/20, not 50/50. I always give more than I get.”</li><li class="listItem">Daria says, “The pattern I see with myself in love relationships is that the physical relationship is the most important. If I am not present in the most sexual way, I feel I will not receive love from my boyfriend. I am valued for what I do for him sexually. I got this from my mom. She was always so beautiful. She would get dressed for Dad. She smelled good, sexy lingerie, sex toys, tried to look good for Dad. Dad had <span class="italic"><span>Playboy</span></span> magazines, and she would look through them with us. Sex was very important to their relationship. She taught me that what I can do for a man was how I would be valued by him.”</li><li class="listItem">In every relationship, Coral has worked harder than the man. “I keep everything going when things don’t work out. I feel responsible for everything. I don’t hold him as accountable as I hold myself.”</li><li class="listItem">“My pattern is to pick men I can control completely,” Charlene says. “Then I can’t get hurt. I pick people underneath me or less accomplished than I am. When I got married, I was screaming in my head, No, no, no. I knew then, but I kept going.”</li><li class="listItem">Marlene says, “I always got into relationships with people who were messed up and needed me. My last boyfriend tried to kill himself when I broke up with him and had to be hospitalized. I always got the boys that were down on their luck. I do the same thing with girlfriends. I am everyone’s adviser.”</li><li class="listItem">Kate, 64, relates the following: “My relationship patterns are not good. I usually picked the wrong men. My first husband was abusive, physically and emotionally; my second husband was an alcoholic and a drug addict; and my third husband is an addict and felon. I smother, take care of them, and try to fix everything. I often get to a point where I have had enough and then I go on. I tend to try to impress and over-love somebody to make him love me.”</li><li class="listItem">Margie is a single career woman. “My relationships are always kind of nonemotional. Kind of like a business, rather than an emotional connection. Not feeling fulfilled. Finding that there is something missing from that person that I could find elsewhere. Feeling the sensation of being trapped at times. I am the codependent, the caregiver. I’ve always wanted to be the dependent one.”</li><li class="listItem">Dee Dee, 72, looks back at her marriage and her children. “I learned codependency. I see it with my husband and with my kids too. If I just do this or do that, you will love me more. I feel like I lost a lot of my identity and I am now finding myself again. My husband doesn’t value me for who I am, only what I do for him. I’ve always been the pleaser, the peacemaker, making sure everything is okay and nobody is upset.”</li></ul><p class="para"><span>Until a woman has discovered and claimed her own sense of self, she will be frightened by a competent man who <span class="italic"><span>can</span></span> actually meet her needs as she in turn meets his. A healthy man doesn’t want to be controlled or mothered, and he also wants to give in return. He understands how to be interdependent. The codependent needs to understand and realize that her behavior as a codependent is in truth her defense mechanism for her own dependency. It is her way to rail against these dependent needs and try to show that she is strong and in control and doesn’t need anybody, when in reality, she does, as do we all.</span></p><p class="para"><span>It is much easier for the codependent to accept and face her issues than for the dependent, because the codependent looks stronger and more competent on the outside as she is running that basketball floor and making those baskets in victory. Who wants to admit that they are a dependent soul? Doesn’t it sound better to say, “I am a caretaker,” than to say, “I want someone to take care of me”? Dependents don’t openly admit to this tendency and so they have a more difficult time getting in touch with this part of the narcissistic legacy. It is an eye-opener to most codependents, however, when they realize that their codependent behavior is a disguise for deeper unmet needs. They somehow have to see themselves as more powerful than they are to override the pain. In recovery, however, codependents do recognize their dependent issues.</span></p><p class="chapterHeadA"><span><span class="bold"><span>The Dependent Relationship</span></span></span></p><p class="paraNoIndent"><span>The dependent daughter in a relationship is also looking for a partner to fill the emotional void and the emptiness left by a narcissistic mother. Her partner becomes the replacement for her mother, and he enacts the <span class="italic"><span>what you can do for me</span></span> part of the relationship.</span></p><p class="para"><span>Relationships go through stages. The first stage can be characterized by feelings of “cloud nine” surreal fascination. I call this “la-la land,” where the dependent daughter is in hog heaven. She has found a guy to take care of her and give her everything she didn’t get in childhood—a dream come true! It looks perfect in the beginning because all conflict is put on the shelf and control given to her partner. What could be better? She didn’t get the love she needed in childhood, and now Mr. Right is going to fulfill her every dream!</span></p><p class="para"><span>In the end, however, Mr. Right becomes Mr. Mistake. The dependent daughter has unconsciously chosen a man to take care of her who will likely become codependent. She will end up stifling him with her overwhelming demands, jealousy, and insecurities. She will want him to be with her at all times and expect him to meet all her needs, particularly her emotional needs. When he cannot do this, she will be angry, like her mother had been, which will confuse and frustrate her partner. The daughter, too, will end up in a lot of pain as she reenacts her relationship with her narcissistic mother in a role reversal. She will feel the same disappointment and emptiness she felt as a child, and blame her spouse for not being good enough for her. Her sense of entitlement will spring into action, resembling Mom as she rails, “If you love me, you will do these things for me, and I deserve and expect this [entitlement].”</span></p><ul class="bulletList"><li class="listItem">Lise recalls that she stayed uninvolved in her early years and had lots of partners. “I never let anyone get too close. When I did get married at age 31, it was all about what he could do for me. When he couldn’t do for me, I left. It had to be my way or the highway.”</li><li class="listItem">Sarah Jo, 44, relates, “My emptiness shows up in my relationships. My empty feeling seems to go away when someone is enamored with me and I get a honeymoon feeling; then, when it is not there, I feel empty. It takes on a somatic element—I physically feel heaviness in my chest. Not cardiac, have had it tested. It physically feels like a hole.”</li><li class="listItem">Dawn, 30, says, “I choose men who can’t love me—the emotionally unavailable types. My mother did this too. I do it on a grander scale, quantity wise, and my grandmother did the same thing. Then I have to work really hard at not being too needy as my dependency kicks in.”</li></ul><p class="para"><span>Although we have seen the distinct patterns of the codependent and the dependent adult daughter, it is important to understand that you can switch back and forth between these two relationship dynamics depending on where you are emotionally at the time. You can do this within one relationship; you can also become one or the other with different men. Although this sounds confusing, it is best understood this way: The daughter of a narcissistic mother has unmet needs and therefore displays some neediness. The codependent behavior is a disguise to cover up the neediness and display strength and competence. When under stress, her neediness will come out and she will look like the dependent.</span></p><p class="chapterHeadA"><span><span class="bold"><span>The Loner</span></span></span></p><p class="paraNoIndent"><span>The loner wears different hats, some healthy, some not. As a part of recovery it is often advised that the daughter of a narcissistic mother spend some time alone to focus on herself and learn how to fulfill her needs for herself. She may need to slow down for a while to accomplish this healthy “loner time.” Even if she is married or in a relationship, she can spend some time alone in order to work on her authentic self.</span></p><p class="para"><span>The unhealthy loner, however, is the daughter who has decided she is so damaged or unlovable that she can never be in a relationship. Usually because she has had a series of bad relationships, she has given up on herself. She wants to have love in her life, but believes nothing can change and decides to just go it alone from here on out. She has great fears of connecting again because she is aware that her “relationship picker” has been damaged by her narcissistic mother’s messages, and this fear prevents her from finding what she wants in a love relationship. She avoids the dating scene, is lonely but stays alone anyway, and her feeling of “I’m not good enough” becomes a mantra for her life.</span></p><ul class="bulletList"><li class="listItem">Marcia, 59, trusts no one but her dog. “I am angry that I have spent the best years of my adult life in unhealthy relationships trying to capture the love and approval my mother withheld. Only because my life exploded on all fronts did I gain the perspective that I had been blind to the recurrences of unhealthy childhood dynamics. I’m nearly 60 years old now, so much life has gone by, and I’m basically alone today. Guess what? I’m staying that way! It’s far too risky to do anything else.”</li></ul><p class="para"><span>Having been there myself for a time, I know that this woman just needs to complete her own recovery. When she does, the world will look better. I tell my clients that you cannot trust men without trusting yourself and your “relationship picker.” You can’t have the word TR_ST without the letter U. Hanging in there and reviving yourself is the answer for this kind of loner. I’ll show you some ways to restore your faith in your own intuition.</span></p><p class="para"><span>Another kind of loner has made a conscious decision after recovery to spend her life without a love relationship. She truly has no fears barring the way to a relationship and her decision is a healthy one. I don’t know many women who do this, but the ones I do know are in a state of self-fulfillment; they have made a good decision for themselves. Who can argue with this? Even if most do not choose this route, it can be a healthy place to be.</span></p><p class="chapterHeadA"><span><span class="bold"><span>Post-Romantic Stress</span></span></span></p><div class="chapterEpigraph"><p class="paraNoIndent"><span>She did not know how to love me and I don’t know how to love you.</span></p><p class="extractSource"><span>—Sidda Walker, in <span class="italic"><span>Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood</span></span><span class="centerImage"><span><a href="part0028.html#en_des_00007_00001"><sup class="calibre3">2</sup></a></span></span></span></p></div><ul class="bulletList"><li class="listItem">Savannah, 38, relates, “When I met my husband, I wouldn’t let him in emotionally. It took me years to feel the love for him that I have now. I didn’t love him then the way I am able to now. Or my children. It took time to learn it. I used to feel it for my cat, but not for people. All my feelings were numb, even the good ones.”</li></ul><p class="para"><span>In summary, daughters of narcissistic mothers face a number of serious struggles in love relationships, including shame and feelings of not being good enough. Relationship failures are often the main reason they seek therapy in the first place: They don’t understand why they keep making the same mistakes and they fear that their “stupidity” in choosing the wrong men can never be rectified. You may know how painful this can be for yourself, your sister, or your friends. Many of my clients are in a state of hopelessness and depression when they begin therapy, but I am always happy to inform them that there is good news and hope. When a daughter chooses to invest in herself, face the wounded childhood and history, and complete the recovery process (to come in part 3), things begin to change. Learning to stop the repetition compulsion, to separate from your mother, build your own sense of self, and free yourself from the damaging internalized messages, you set out on a whole new healthy, optimistic journey. My client Kimberly puts it like this:</span></p><ul class="bulletList"><li class="listItem">“I have worked through the deep-rooted narcissistic abuse from my childhood, so I am now living a happier life with myself, my son, my husband and family. I have given up the old hope of getting my mother’s love. In turn, the love in my heart is overflowing and more powerful than I ever imagined possible.”</li></ul><p class="paraNoIndent"><span>We are almost ready for the recovery section to see how Kimberly and others have accomplished the above. But before we do that, there’s one more arena we must take a look at: what happens when we become mothers ourselves.</span></p></div></div></body></html>
