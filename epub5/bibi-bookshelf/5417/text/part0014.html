Image was all that mattered to Mom. She was obsessed with appearance right up until she died at age fifty-four from complications during a liposuction.</span></p><p class="chapterEpigraphSource"><span>—Joanie, 45</span></p></div></div><div class="centerImage"><p class="chapterOpenerText"><span><span class="chapterOpenerFirstLetters"><span><span class="bold"><span>P</span></span></span></span>ut a smile on that pretty little face. Throw back your shoulders, hold up your head, and don’t let the world know that you are unhappy.” As a child, I was told this repeatedly. I cannot count the times I felt like frowning or crying and my mother would cite those lines to me. It hurts to smile if the feeling underneath is sadness, anger, confusion, or some other kind of pain. Sometimes it just feels good to frown, be sad, be angry—in other words, <span class="italic"><span>be real.</span></span></span></p><p class="chapterHeadA"><span><span class="bold"><span>How It Looks Is More Important Than How It Feels</span></span></span></p><p class="paraNoIndent"><span>Daughters of narcissistic mothers are told plainly in words or by their mothers’ example: <span class="italic"><span>“How you look is more important than who you are or how you feel.”</span></span> The “image message” has little to do with healthy selfhood; it springs from the internal insecurity and fragile ego of the narcissistic mother. Narcissists typically put on a great show so that others think they are special or unique, and they even convince themselves of this. But at their core is a disoriented, ill-developed sense of self that is very small, incomplete, and defective.</span></p><p class="para"><span>Our culture’s materialism, advanced technology, and material wealth reinforce the importance of image and presentation for everyone. But women are subjected to it more constantly and are more vulnerable to persistent cultural ideals of thinness, fitness, and perfection. Daughters of narcissistic mothers are not only pressured by the culture, they’re also pressured by their mothers’ ceaseless messages about maintaining a perfect image. For us, it is a double whammy! These combined forces present a tremendous challenge for the girl or woman trying to be her own person. Below we will discuss the image messages we got from Mother and then see how our narcissistic culture frosts the cake with lavish reinforcement.</span></p><p class="chapterHeadA"><span><span class="bold"><span>Projecting the “Right” Image: Maternal Reflections</span></span></span></p><p class="paraNoIndent"><span>In <span class="italic"><span>Postcards from the Edge,</span></span> the movie based on Carrie Fisher’s semi-autobiographical novel, the mother (Shirley MacLaine) is ill and in the hospital. All she worries about is her hair and makeup, and she tells her daughter that she does not want to be buried without her eyebrows. Her daughter (Meryl Streep) explains the family to a doctor this way: “We’re designed more for public than for private.”<span class="centerImage"><span><a href="part0028.html#en_des_00004_00000"><sup class="calibre3">1</sup></a></span></span> The women I’ve treated and interviewed agree.</span></p><p class="para"><span>Image is what Mother wants the world to see about <span class="italic"><span>her,</span></span> and she expects her daughter to polish that image further, and carry it for the family into the world. But most daughters are overpowered by this expectation. They can’t carry their mothers’ image and they have trouble establishing their own.</span></p><ul class="bulletList"><li class="listItem">Tonya, 28, confides, “Mom so wanted me to be the ‘image girl.’ She wanted the most popular girl in school, dating the football player, majorette and prom queen type. I was not that kind of teenager and it was a big disappointment to her. I had anxiety disorders and low self-esteem.”</li></ul><p class="para"><span>Daughters internalize maternal messages about image that can persist well into their lives as independent adults. Bella said, “I learned that it is about how it looks, not how it feels. I picked this up in my personal appearance and my home. I wish I didn’t do this, but it doesn’t matter who is coming over to my house, I want it to look pretty. Our house with Mom was always pretty and clean. I don’t walk around without makeup on, except when alone with my husband. I like to take care of myself, and I am very competitive with other women if we go out. I feel pressure from society to be thin, pretty, and look nice.”</span></p><ul class="bulletList"><li class="listItem">“This image thing was a strong message,” says Jessica, 43. “To this day, I keep things looking good and hunky-dory at my house. No one in our family knows that my husband and I have any problems. It made me concerned about how I look too. Now I want to have a boob job and I am jealous of other women.”</li><li class="listItem">“When my mother died, she was in a coma for a time,” recalls Magda, 55. “The nurses had pulled her hair back in a braid, and it looked awful. When she died and I went over to the mortuary and saw her body, she still had this stupid braid. My dad had dressed her appropriately, but that braid! All I could think of was she wouldn’t be caught dead with her hair like that!”</li><li class="listItem">Living up to Mother’s expectations sometimes requires surrendering personal choice. Charlie told me, “My mother put special efforts into how my sister and I looked. We were always perfectly matched with bows, colors, shoes, and outfits. I don’t remember choosing something that I wore until I was at least 14.”</li></ul><p class="para"><span>Mother sometimes completely disregards a girl’s wishes, and the daughter may end up feeling that she is an object, not a person. My own mother used to braid my hair so tightly my eyes would slant and I would cry and say it hurt. Her message back was, “It hurts to be beautiful!” I still don’t know what that really means. Does it mean that if I don’t look a certain way, I won’t be successful, accepted, or loved? And that to look the accepted way, it has to hurt? What a disturbing worldview that was! The endless focus on beauty can become exhausting.</span></p><ul class="bulletList"><li class="listItem">Trisha, 34, says, “There was always the ‘looks’ issue. My mother would always pull my bangs off my face and say, ‘Look at her face.’ I got kicked out of the house when I was 13 because my bangs were too long. Mother just walked up to me one day and cut them off.”</li><li class="listItem">Sonja’s mother used to recite, “We must, we must, we must improve our bust,” and tell her, “Good God, girl, do those exercises. Don’t you know that no man will even notice you if you don’t develop bosoms?”</li></ul><p class="para"><span>An obsession with “how things look” can cause the narcissistic mother (or grandmother) to neglect basic parenting responsibilities. Amanda tells about the time that her daughter got in serious trouble with the law and had to go to court. Local journalists took a strong interest in the case, and there were reporters everywhere. Amanda needed her mother’s support, but her mother was too concerned about image to show up: “She said she couldn’t go to court with me and her granddaughter because she couldn’t handle the media seeing her break down. Mom carried on about how my kids are always in trouble and how she didn’t raise her kids to be like this. As if it was about her! It’s always too much for her to handle!” Amanda got some spunk when she finally told her mother, “Ya know, Mom, I like my kids better than I like yours!”</span></p><ul class="bulletList"><li class="listItem">Cassie got to the point in her young adulthood where she wouldn’t tell her mother anything because her mother used it as a tool either to prove how wonderful or how stupid Cassie was, depending on how it made her mother look. “She always wanted me to marry a doctor. She used my accomplishments like a badge. She would set me up with sleazy doctors to date and then scan me to see if I looked okay. Was I presentable? Did I embarrass her?”</li><li class="listItem">Leslie, 58, remembers as a child worrying about her parents’ financial situation. “They must have talked about it in front of me. I decided I needed to help. Codependent-trained me. So I called my grandmother and asked her if she would please send some money to my poor parents to help them. Reasonable, huh? Well, grandmother dear had a bit of narcissism as well. The next time she saw me, she raked me over the coals. ‘Don’t ever call me and say anything personal again, especially about money and your parents! We have a party line out here in the country and the neighbors can hear!’ Well, let’s see, I think I was about seven years old at the time. Tell you something? Yes, Granny, I won’t embarrass you again. Forget about what I was feeling as a little girl worrying about her parents. I wonder, did I think then, What about me? Probably not, I must have felt just like a bad kid who had done something wrong—again.”</li><li class="listItem">If a daughter doesn’t fulfill her mother’s goals for her, sometimes the daughter is made to feel as if her true accomplishments don’t matter. Julie, 30, remembers, “Whenever I was getting ready to go to my middle school Open House Night with my parents, Mom tortured me about what I was going to wear and how I would wear my hair. She never said anything about my project being chosen as one of the best in the class. Never took the time to look through my folders in each of my classrooms. I never got the feeling that Mom valued the things I valued about myself.”</li><li class="listItem">The relentless focus on image leaves no room for true feelings. Often, the daughter is forced to be insincere to fit the mother’s image. Maya, 22, told me, “After Mom and Dad split up, Mom always instructed me to appear happy whenever I was with Dad. ‘Don’t show him that we are suffering without him,’ she’d tell me. I was suffering, but I did not want to disobey her, so I felt as if I was literally pasting a fake smile on my face. And when Dad would ask how I was doing, I’d say, ‘Great. Everything’s going fine!’ Lying like that made me feel guilty, like I was betraying my father.”</li></ul><p class="para"><span>Because we internalize these kinds of messages throughout our childhood and adolescence, we ourselves become image-focused. We feel like we never measure up. And the narcissistic culture in which we live powerfully reinforces these childhood messages.</span></p><p class="chapterHeadA"><span><span class="bold"><span>Projecting the “Right” Image: Cultural Reflections</span></span></span></p><p class="paraNoIndent"><span>American culture today in general maintains an image founded on “what” instead of on “who.” Messages to perform, excel, and be beautiful bombard every aspect of daily life, and the general incidence of narcissism appears to be rising.

And more than half strongly agree that physically attractive women are more valued by men. More than two-thirds (68%) of women strongly agree that the media and advertising set an unrealistic standard of beauty that most women can’t ever achieve. Well over half of all women (57%) strongly agree that the attributes of female beauty have become very narrowly defined in today’s world.<span class="centerImage"><span><a href="part0028.html#en_des_00004_00006"><sup class="calibre3">7</sup></a></span></span></span></p></div><p class="para"><span>According to the Dove study, only 2 percent of women describe themselves as beautiful and only 13 percent are satisfied with their body weight and shape.

But women who were taught that how they appear is more important than personal feelings, identity, values, and authenticity feel empty. Whenever I heard Tina Turner sing “What’s Love Got to Do with It?” I really wished that the message were “What’s <span class="italic"><span>Beauty</span></span> Got to Do with It?” Love actually has everything to do with our healthy development.</span></p><p class="para"><span>In order to recover from this emptiness and image-oriented life view, the daughter of a narcissistic mother first has to learn how to tune in to who she is as a person.
