Furthermore, to pass them on successfully, a mother needs to have created an engaged and balanced relationship with her daughter. One of the problems with narcissism is that it does not allow for balance. Daughters of narcissistic mothers live in family environments that are extreme. True to their legacy of distorted love, which has been carried over from generation to generation, most narcissistic mothers either severely over-parent (the engulfing mother) or severely under-parent (the ignoring mother). Although these two parenting styles are seemingly opposite, to a child raised with either narcissistic style, the impact of the opposite is the same. Your self-image becomes distorted and feelings of insecurity seem impossible to shake.</span></p><p class="para"><span>The engulfing mother smothers, seemingly unaware of her daughter’s unique needs or desires. Perhaps you were raised like this. If so, it is likely that the natural talents you had, the dreams you wanted to pursue, and maybe even the relationships most important to you were rarely nurtured. Your mother constantly sent messages to you about who she needed you to be, instead of validating who you really were. Desperate to merit her love and approval, you conformed, and in the process, lost yourself.</span></p><p class="para"><span>If you were raised by an ignoring mother, the message she gave you over and over was that you were invisible. She simply did not have enough room in her heart for you. As a result, you were dismissed and discounted. Children with severe ignoring mothers do not receive even the most basic requirements of food, shelter, clothing or protection, let alone guidance and emotional support. Lack of a consistent home environment may have made you feel insecure, unhealthy, or unsuccessful at school. Emotional and physical neglect sends you the message that you don’t matter.</span></p><p class="para"><span>Having a narcissistic mother, whether she is engulfing or ignoring, makes individuation—a separate sense of self—difficult for a daughter to accomplish. Daughters with unmet emotional needs keep going back to their mothers, hoping to gain their love and respect at a later date. Daughters who have a full emotional “tank” have the confidence to separate in a healthy fashion, and move on into adulthood. Later, in the recovery chapter, we will address this in greater depth. For now, let’s look at the different faces of engulfing and ignoring mothers and their effects on daughters.</span></p><p class="chapterHeadA"><span><span class="bold"><span>The Engulfing Mother</span></span></span></p><p class="paraNoIndent"><span>The engulfing mother tries to dominate and control every aspect of her daughter’s life. She makes all the decisions and pressures the daughter on what to wear, how to act, what to say, what to think, and how to feel. Her daughter has little room to grow and blossom individually or to find her own voice, becoming in many ways an extension of her mother.</span></p><p class="para"><span>Engulfing mothers often appear to be great moms. Because they’re very involved in their daughters’ lives and may always be doing things for them and with them, others outside the family often view them as active, engaged parents. Yet, the weakened self-image and the sense of unworthiness their daughters take away from this behavior are tragic. Narcissistic mothers are unaware of the damaging, often devastating consequences of their behavior, which of course does not diminish its lasting effects.</span></p><ul class="bulletList"><li class="listItem">Miriam was 28 years old, engaged to be married, and locked in a fierce struggle with her mother over control of her life. Miriam’s mother did not approve of her fiancé, and was doing everything conceivable to interfere, including speaking negatively about him to several people at his place of employment. “My mother hoped the word would get back to me that my fiancé was a loser or better still, that he would give up and leave town.”</li><li class="listItem">“Let me tell you a thing or two about love relationships,” Toby’s mother would say to her all too often. Toby, 48, describes her mother as someone who “loves men and knows how to manipulate them.” When Toby was old enough to date, her mother would coach her on how to keep a man’s interest, admonishing her daughter if she was not flirtatious enough. “She would undo the top buttons on my blouse, and show me how to act sexy.” Toby remembers her mother’s sage advice: “If you don’t sleep with them, you lose them.”</li><li class="listItem">Sandy’s mother always wanted her daughter to be just like her. She took pride in telling people that she was trying to clone herself. When Sandy went into recovery, she felt she had to fight her entire family’s perceptions that she was a younger version of her mother. “We were connected, my mother and I, but I had to ask all my relatives to please quit putting the burdens of her sins on me.”</li></ul><p class="para"><span>Showbiz moms are a classic example of engulfing mothers, the ones who shepherd their daughters through child beauty pageants or TV shows like <span class="italic"><span>Showbiz Moms &amp; Dads</span></span>. The ad for this show in a popular magazine contains the line “Some parents want fame so badly” next to a picture of a mother pushing her little princess onto the stage. It makes you worry about how these experiences affect the minds of these young, manipulated children, and what kind of young women they will become.</span></p><p class="para"><span>The musical <span class="italic"><span>Gypsy</span></span> features the quintessential engulfing mom.<span class="centerImage"><span><a href="part0028.html#en_des_00002_00001"><sup class="calibre3">2</sup></a></span></span> “Sing out, Louise,” the mother says as her daughter is entertaining onstage. In the original movie version, Rosalind Russell plays Mama Rose, a flamboyant, extroverted, narcissistic mother with two daughters, Louise and June, whom she is pushing into show business. When the younger daughter, June, who Mama Rose thinks is more talented, marries and leaves home, Mama Rose, looking for another way to realize her own aspirations, focuses on the older daughter, Louise (Natalie Wood). The daughters’ responses in this production are interesting. June eventually tires of being the “cute one” and runs away, and Louise rebels by becoming the famous stripper Gypsy Rose Lee. Both daughters leave their mother with her dreams unrealized.</span></p><p class="para"><span>Each one of us is imbued with a deep yearning to live our own life, not our mother’s. Yet the narcissistic mother puts pressure on her child to act and react to the world as she would. A child raised in this way makes decisions according to what she believes will win her mother’s love and approval. Accustomed to her mother thinking for her, the girl has difficulty later on creating an authentic, healthy adult life for herself.</span></p><p class="chapterHeadA"><span><span class="bold"><span>The Ignoring Mother</span></span></span></p><p class="paraNoIndent"><span>Mothers who ignore or under-parent their daughters do not provide guidance, emotional support, or empathy. They consistently discount and deny your emotions. Even if, as my mother instilled in me, “I had a roof over my head, clothes to wear, food to eat, so what is the problem?” I was still in a lot of inner pain—as are other daughters with mothers who ignore them.</span></p><ul class="bulletList"><li class="listItem">The comedy/drama <span class="italic"><span>Mermaids</span></span> portrays an irresponsible, self-absorbed mother (Cher). In this movie, everything is about Mom and her relationships, while her daughters’ emotional worlds are empty. Some of the daughters’ lines in this movie say it all. For example, “This is our mother. Pray for us.” “Mom is many things; normal is not one of them.” And, “Mom, I’m not invisible.”<span class="centerImage"><span><a href="part0028.html#en_des_00002_00002"><sup class="calibre3">3</sup></a></span></span></li></ul><p class="para"><span>If a girl is fortunate, she may find another adult who can help her, recognize and validate her feelings and provide some measure of guidance. This person can be an emotional lifesaver. For instance, as Marie grew up, her mother refused to teach her about some pretty essential matters. “When I started my period at age thirteen, I couldn’t go to Mom. Whenever any sexual allusion came up, even on TV, she’d say, ‘Don’t talk to me about sex; I don’t want to discuss it.’ When I needed personal items, I had to call my sister or my teacher. My teacher was the one who explained menstruation to me.”</span></p><p class="para"><span>In my psychotherapy practice, I’ve seen case after case of mothers and daughters whose relationship looks good on the outside, but inside the child is feeling deep pain, confusion, and distress. I always tell children that I am a “feelings” doctor, because I want to get the message to them right away that my office is a place to talk about feelings, which are so often ignored, devalued, or denied by their mothers. The children often learn more quickly than their parents how to discuss their feelings and to begin to heal.</span></p><p class="para"><span>Ignoring behavior creates deep emotional gaps in a child’s life that can go undetected for years, but physical abuse or neglect is more blatantly visible. When narcissistic parents are unable or unwilling to meet a daughter’s most basic requirements—to keep her physically safe, healthy, and in school—it shows.</span></p><p class="para"><span>My practice is full of abused and neglected kids. Working with these children has evolved as a specialty in my career, a way for me to give back and make a difference to suffering children. A piece of my heart needs to try to help little girls, especially those waiting to be adopted or who are living in foster homes, longing for mothers they don’t have.</span></p><p class="para"><span>I’ve had many children ask me to take them home, such as one darling eight-year-old who said, “Dr. Karyl, do you know how to cook? How many bedrooms do you have at your house? Do you have any toys?” Then she quietly added, “If I can come home with you, I will do the dishes every day and even wash all your windows!” If my profession did not have certain ethical rules that preclude this, I would have opened an orphanage in my home by now. One of my respected colleagues, Linda Vaughan, who also worked with abused and neglected children, wrote this poem after working intensely with a foster child who had been removed from her narcissistic mother’s home:</span></p><p class="spaceBreak"><span> </span></p><p class="colophon"><span><span class="italic"><span>Dear Mommy</span></span></span></p><p class="colophon"><span><span class="italic"><span>I’m doing really good,</span></span></span></p><p class="colophon"><span><span class="italic"><span>I get all A’s in school</span></span></span></p><p class="colophon"><span><span class="italic"><span>And I don’t cry at bedtime anymore,</span></span></span></p><p class="colophon"><span><span class="italic"><span>Though my new mom said I could.</span></span></span></p><p class="colophon"><span><span class="italic"><span>I remember how much you hate tears,</span></span></span></p><p class="colophon"><span><span class="italic"><span>You slapped them out of me</span></span></span></p><p class="colophon"><span><span class="italic"><span>To make me strong,</span></span></span></p><p class="colophon"><span><span class="italic"><span>I think it worked.</span></span></span></p><p class="colophon"><span><span class="italic"><span>I learned to use a microscope</span></span></span></p><p class="colophon"><span><span class="italic"><span>And my hair grew two inches.</span></span></span></p><p class="colophon"><span><span class="italic"><span>It’s pretty, just like yours.</span></span></span></p><p class="colophon"><span><span class="italic"><span>I’m not allowed to clean the house,</span></span></span></p><p class="colophon"><span><span class="italic"><span>Only my own room,</span></span></span></p><p class="colophon"><span><span class="italic"><span>Isn’t that a funny rule?</span></span></span></p><p class="colophon"><span><span class="italic"><span>You say kids are so much trouble</span></span></span></p><p class="colophon"><span><span class="italic"><span>Getting born, they better pay it back.</span></span></span></p><p class="colophon"><span><span class="italic"><span>I’m not supposed to take care</span></span></span></p><p class="colophon"><span><span class="italic"><span>Of the other kids, only me, I sort of like it.</span></span></span></p><p class="colophon"><span><span class="italic"><span>I still get the hole in my stomach</span></span></span></p><p class="colophon"><span><span class="italic"><span>When I do something wrong,</span></span></span></p><p class="colophon"><span><span class="italic"><span>I have a saying on my mirror</span></span></span></p><p class="colophon"><span><span class="italic"><span>“Kids make mistakes, It’s OK,”</span></span></span></p><p class="colophon"><span><span class="italic"><span>I read it every day,</span></span></span></p><p class="colophon"><span><span class="italic"><span>Sometimes I even believe it.</span></span></span></p><p class="colophon"><span><span class="italic"><span>I wonder if you ever think of me</span></span></span></p><p class="colophon"><span><span class="italic"><span>Or if you’re glad the troublemaker’s gone,</span></span></span></p><p class="colophon"><span><span class="italic"><span>I never want to see you again.</span></span></span></p><p class="colophon"><span><span class="italic"><span>I love you, Mommy.</span></span><span class="centerImage"><span><a href="part0028.html#en_des_00002_00003"><sup class="calibre3">4</sup></a></span></span></span></p><p class="spaceBreak"><span> </span></p><p class="para"><span>Sometimes these children have little to eat, live in filthy, unsanitary homes, have no medical care, or have been physically, sexually, or emotionally abused.

Although she lives in a less than ideal situation, she carries a great deal of hope in her heart. “My mom never cooks meals for us. We’ve never had one of those family meals you see on TV where the whole family is sitting around a table and eating together. I get my own meals and I am pretty good at cans of soup and mac and cheese.” One day Madeline decided to cook for her mother. She made “some pretty good” pasta and fruit cups for both of them. When little Madeline announced that dinner was ready, her mother told her that she was dieting and wasn’t hungry. “So, since I had set the table with two plates,” Madeline relates with a confident tilt to her head, “first I filled my plate and ate all of that, and then I switched to her plate and filled it up and ate that too. I pretended she was there. I played both people. I even had a pretend conversation with her, saying, ‘Well, how was your day? What did you do today?’”</li><li class="listItem">Marion, 70, tells a horrendous story about what happened to her sister. “My older sister disappeared when she was 16. One night my brother went to pick her up from church and she wasn’t there. For a year and a half we looked for her. Then one day, this semi-truck drove up and this big guy got out, followed by my sister and a baby. Then we learned my mom had run into him, he thought my sister was beautiful, he wanted her and asked how to get her. Mom said, ‘Give me $300 and you can take her off my hands.’ He bought her! Now my sister asks, ‘Why did Mama sell me?’ The guy was horrible to her, locked her in a closet while he was at work so she couldn’t run away. He abused her. When my dad found out, he wanted to kill the guy, and I thought he was going to kill my mom too.”</li></ul><p class="para"><span>I see an astounding number of ignoring parents in divorce cases. Since the court system operates on the basis of adversarial relationships, spouses usually end up squaring off on one side or the other. Professionals advising families during divorce proceedings generally work for either the mother or the father. In many parenting-time proceedings, the discussion focuses not on what is in the best interest of the child as the law dictates, but on what is best for the parent. It is a sad commentary on our culture that many parenting-time evaluators and judges listen more intently to what the parents want than what is truly best for the children. In Denver, there is even talk about which evaluator is “for the father” and which is “for the mother.” What about being a “child advocate”?</span></p><p class="para"><span>Divorce also sometimes leads one parent to turn a child against the other parent so he or she can have his way in the custody battle. This is a classic example of emotional child abuse that hurts the child much more than these alienating parents realize. In these cases, parents may take care of the child physically, but completely disregard his or her emotional needs.</span></p><ul class="bulletList"><li class="listItem">Keri’s mother destroyed Keri’s relationship with her father when the two adults were going through a divorce. “Mom was crazy jealous of our time with Daddy. She would say, ‘Go see your father and I will be fine,’ and then she would go into a depressive stupor for ten days and make us feel guilty. It got so bad that we stopped seeing Daddy because we didn’t want to hurt our mom. Then he died suddenly and we couldn’t even go to the funeral. We couldn’t grieve his death in the presence of our mother because it bothered her too much!”</li></ul><p class="para"><span>The behavior patterns of abusive, ignoring, or neglectful mothers are generally identifiable, but grow much more complex and confusing when a narcissistic mother demonstrates a mix of both engulfing and ignoring behaviors. Let’s look at the ways this particular combination plays out.</span></p><p class="chapterHeadA"><span><span class="bold"><span>The Mix of Engulfing and Ignoring Behaviors</span></span></span></p><p class="paraNoIndent"><span>Although my research suggests that most narcissists display one type preferentially, the two styles are not mutually exclusive. A mother can flip from engulfing to ignoring and back, as does the mother in the film <span class="italic"><span>Terms of Endearment</span></span>. Aurora, the mother (Shirley MacLaine), constantly examines her infant daughter to see if she’s breathing. She jiggles her baby, waking her abruptly to check. When the baby cries, Aurora indicates her maternal approval with a contented, “That’s more like it,” and closes the door, leaving the baby crying alone in her crib.<span class="centerImage"><span><a href="part0028.html#en_des_00002_00004"><sup class="calibre3">5</sup></a></span></span></span></p><p class="para"><span>My mother exhibited both extremes with two different daughters—engulfing behavior with my sister and ignoring behavior with me. I believe her actions were related to where we were in birth order and where Mom was in life. In a nutshell, she pressured me to grow up quickly to take care of her and help her with the rest of the family, and she tried to keep my sister a child by helping her with everything. I was the second to oldest child. My mother would say no to me and assume that I would figure things out. She would always do things for my sister, who was the baby, even when my sister was being irresponsible. While my mother gave me the message that I had to handle things on my own, she gave my sister the message that she could not handle anything without her intervention.</span></p><p class="para"><span>Effective mothering strikes a proper balance between permissiveness and restraint. A girl who has been parented on that middle ground learns she can grow along with her talents and passions; her feelings are acknowledged and treated with respect.

She’s a public entertainer, loved by the masses, but secretly feared by her intimate house partners and children. If you can perform in her show, too, all the better. If you can’t, you’d better watch out. She is noticeable, flashy, fun, and “out there.” Some love her, but you despise the outward masquerade she performs for the world. For you know that you don’t really matter to her and her show, except in how you make her look to the rest of the world. Seeing how the world responds to her confuses you. You see that she doesn’t offer the same warmth and charisma to you, her child, as she does to others—to friends, colleagues, family, even to strangers. “If she could only love me, then she could be whatever she wants to be and I wouldn’t care,” you feel. You desperately want her to know you and to let you be yourself too.</span></p><p class="para"><span>More often than not, these mothers lead charmed lives and want their daughters to fit into their social world and conform to their mold.</span></p><ul class="bulletList"><li class="listItem">Sherry’s mother was a perfect example of this. She worked hard at getting attention. Her looks changed as often as the weather, and for maximum dramatic effect. “I don’t recall ever seeing her natural hair color,” Sherry, 55, said with a wry smile. She remembers her mother’s different phases. “In the early ’60s, she had the Jackie O look, big hats. When the mod things came out, she had sunglasses and miniskirts. She was always in style, the center of attention. I always felt I didn’t want to move into her territory. I remember being embarrassed about the hot pants and pantyhose under them. White go-go boots and stiletto heels. She always took it a step beyond tacky. Somehow I think she knew she wasn’t very authentic. She actually said she wanted this inscription on her tombstone: ‘Will the real Betty please stand up?’”</li><li class="listItem">Amy had an eccentric, flamboyant mother, whose charisma helped her get into and out of a lot of interesting situations. Her mother owned 144 pairs of shoes with matching purses and watches, and was a self-proclaimed psychic who once had her own cable TV show. A chronic liar and gossip, Amy’s mother used to get together with the neighbors and give them psychic readings. “One lady on our block decided that Mom was Satan. She convinced the neighbors of that, so we got kicked out of the neighborhood. My mother’s response was that people would short circuit if given too much spiritual information. She always had an excuse for things or tried to blame others.”</li><li class="listItem">Lina’s mother had a perfect venue in which to shine as the owner of a glamorous nightspot. Lina smiles as she recalls how every evening her mother would dress up in a ball gown and go to her coffeehouse to play hostess. A onetime blues singer who had spent time in Hollywood, Lina’s mother claimed that she had sung with Desi Arnaz, partied with Frank Sinatra, and sat on Cary Grant’s lap. To Lina, her mother is nothing but show. “She likes to tell people who she knows. It’s all about her image. She still does inappropriate stuff like dance around the room to get attention or make an entrance that all will notice. I’ve always thought it was strange that when I introduced her to my friends, she would say, ‘I’m so glad they got to meet me!’”</li></ul><p class="chapterHeadB"><span>THE ACCOMPLISHMENT-ORIENTED</span></p><p class="paraNoIndent"><span>To the accomplishment-oriented mother, what you achieve in life is paramount. Success depends on what you do, not who you are. She expects you to perform at the highest possible level. This mom is very proud of her children’s good grades, tournament wins, admission into the right college, and graduation with the pertinent degrees. She loves to brag about them too. But if you do not become what your accomplishment-oriented mother thinks you should, and accomplish what she thinks is important, she is deeply embarrassed, and may even respond with a rampage of fury and rage.</span></p><p class="para"><span>A confusing dynamic is at play here. Often, while the daughter is trying to achieve a given goal, the mother is not supportive because it takes away from her and the time the daughter has to spend on her. Yet if the daughter achieves what she set out to do, the mother beams with pride at the awards banquet or performance. What a mixed message. The daughter learns not to expect much support unless she becomes a great hit, which sets her up for low self-esteem and an accomplishment-oriented lifestyle.</span></p><ul class="bulletList"><li class="listItem">As a little girl, Yasmin loved to ride horses. But her mother was reluctant to support this costly, time-consuming passion. Yasmin’s father helped her, though, working hard with her to teach her barrel racing, and her mother was furious with him. But success changed the family dynamic. When Yasmin won a blue ribbon at the kids’ rodeo, “Mom plastered the winning smile on her face and the bragging spree began.” Yasmin remembers being confused and hurt.</li><li class="listItem">Carol grew up feeling controlled by her mother’s ambition for her. She took seven years of piano lessons, where she had to play in recitals as well as for her mother’s friends. “I would be playing along and hear her snort if I made a mistake. I could feel her disappointment in me. I felt like I had to be perfect for her. When I was old enough to choose, I purposely flunked the test to the academy for piano where she wanted me to go. After that, I didn’t touch the piano for 12 years. When I moved out and had my own home, I wanted a piano just to play for me. I still can’t play in front of Mom. When I started therapy, I had to stop playing the piano again because it brought up all the old stuff with Mom. I still have a love/hate relationship with the piano. Somehow the line between Mom’s benefit and my benefit got crossed. I was a trophy for her.”</li><li class="listItem">Eleanor’s mother judged people solely on their educational accomplishments. First thing she always asked was where someone went to college. “Harvard and Stanford people were the very best you could find.” Then she wanted to know their degree level. “M.D.’s and the Ph.D.’s were outstanding. Anything less was not good enough. All of her friends were Dr. So-and-So or married to Dr. So-and-So. She didn’t care what kind of people they were or if they were even nice to her or us.” Eleanor leaned back in her chair, exhaling a sigh of relief, and told me, “Thank God, I made a few A’s in my day and have a couple of degrees because if not, she probably wouldn’t even speak to me! Poor Dad is only at the master’s level—I don’t know how he survived with her.”</li><li class="listItem">Mia’s mother obsessed about cleaning. “She was psycho about it: Everything had to be perfect, like we clean the house before the maid comes.

She cares little for those around her, including her daughter, or their needs. If your mother was like this, the only way you were able to get attention from her was to take care of her. If you failed to respond to her, or even rebelled against her behavior, Mom would play the victim by becoming more ill or have an illness-related crisis to redirect your attention and make you feel guilty. I call this the “illness control method.” It is very effective. If the daughter does not respond, she looks bad and feels like a loser who can’t be nice to her mother. The most important thing to the psychosomatic mother is that her daughter be there to care for her and understand <span class="italic"><span>her</span></span>.</span></p><p class="para"><span>Many times the psychosomatic mother uses her illnesses to escape from her feelings or from having to deal with a difficulty in life. The daughter will commonly hear from her father or other family members, “Don’t tell your mother. It will upset her or make her sick.” Some daughters learn that being sick themselves brings some attention from their psychosomatic mothers because illness provides a common bond. The mother can relate to illness and is able to communicate about it with the daughter, but the daughter must be careful not to be sicker than her mother is, because then the mother will not feel cared for, which she feels entitled to.</span></p><ul class="bulletList"><li class="listItem">While migraine headaches are genuinely debilitating, May’s mother used them as a way of escaping problems in the household and would not take care of herself in ways that can help prevent migraines. For instance, she never dealt with her stress, a common trigger for migraines, and allowed herself to become upset by many things. “Mom was not able to deal with anything. She would instantly get a headache and have to be run to the emergency room for some shot that would knock her out for days on end. Then Dad and I would have to deal with whatever it was that was a problem. It was her escape!” This continued throughout May’s young adulthood. “I remember one time telling her that I was dating a much younger man and it was like the headache came on so suddenly neither of us knew what hit her. I guess she didn’t like that!”</li><li class="listItem">Irene was blamed for her mother’s inability to deal with stress. “Whenever anything went wrong at home, Dad would say, ‘Look what you’ve done to your mother.’ Mom would end up in the bedroom sobbing, and have a headache and diarrhea and be on the toilet for hours and then come out to the couch with a rag on her head and all sad. Dad would come to her rescue and blame us, saying she handles stress badly.” Irene needed recognition for herself, but learned that “if I don’t live up to her expectations, she gets aches and pains, has cold sores on her mouth, develops weird rashes, and makes herself sick from emotional stress. Everything has to be about her.”</li><li class="listItem">Jackie’s mother’s behavior got worse as she and Jackie’s father got older and he began to get sick. “Mother always had to be sicker than Daddy was. If I gave Daddy attention because something was wrong, she always had to ‘up’ the illness. Once she faked a heart attack. I can’t count the number of times she called me at work and I rushed over there only to find nothing wrong with her. The one time I didn’t come over after a call, she didn’t speak to me for days, said I never cared for her, and wrote me nasty letters.”</li><li class="listItem">Mona cried during therapy as she discussed her father’s hip surgery, which was hard for him because he was aging and weak. But she was really crying because “the whole time Dad was going through this, my mother said her hip hurt and she needed hip surgery too. She couldn’t let the attention be on him. It was so sick! Her hips were just fine. As soon as Dad recovered, we never heard about her hips again.”</li><li class="listItem">Celeste tells me, “My mom just did a lot of groaning. When she got up or sat down, or walked across the room, she just groaned! She had no physical reason to do this. It seemed to be her way of getting everyone in the room to look at her and ask her if she was okay. Then she would say, ‘Of course I’m okay. Why?’”</li></ul><p class="chapterHeadB"><span>THE ADDICTED</span></p><p class="paraNoIndent"><span>In Rebecca Wells’s novel <span class="italic"><span>Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood,</span></span> Sidda describes the sound of her mother’s voice as “the cacophony of five jiggers of bourbon.” Although “two thousand miles apart, Sidda could hear the ice cubes clinking” as she talks to her mother on the phone. She then says, “If anyone ever made a movie about her childhood, that would be the soundtrack.”<span class="centerImage"><span><a href="part0028.html#en_des_00002_00007"><sup class="calibre3">8</sup></a></span></span></span></p><p class="para"><span>The parent with a substance-abuse problem will always seem narcissistic, because the addiction speaks louder than anything else. Sometimes when an abuser sobers up, the narcissistic behavior goes away. Sometimes not. But while users are using, their focus is always on themselves and their god, the addiction. Children of alcoholics and other substance abusers know this well: The bottle or the drug of choice always comes before anything or anyone else. Substance abuse is an effective way to mask feelings. Clearly, the mother who shows up drunk at her daughter’s choir concert is not thinking of her daughter’s needs.</span></p><ul class="bulletList"><li class="listItem">Hanna had to fend for herself most of her childhood. “For years my mother was hooked on Tylenol with codeine and Valium—totally checked out. By the time I was ten, she had been married seven times. We moved around with lots of different men.” When Hanna was 14, her mother told her that she wanted to kill herself. Hanna pleaded with her not to do it, telling her mother that “I needed her, and I couldn’t survive without her.” Hanna stops for a moment when she tells this story. Her pain is palpable. “She did it anyway. She died by her own hand. I always lost—first a mom who was there but not there and then a mom who killed herself.” After her mother’s suicide, Hanna lived in a trailer park and continued going to school. She did well until her junior year in high school, when she began to call herself in sick to school and started getting high on drugs and alcohol.</li><li class="listItem">Julia’s mother was a party girl almost every night. “We lived in a neighborhood of lots of single parents when I was growing up, and they all partied. My mom loved to throw the party at our house so she didn’t have to get a babysitter. I became one of those ‘moral’ kids. I hated the drinking, smoking, dirty stories, swearing, etc. I used to complain about it to my mom and her boyfriend. They got sick of it, so they used to humiliate me by calling me ‘Queenie.’ When they were planning the next party, Mom would say, ‘We’re having a wild party tonight, Queenie, so you can go to your room, where you won’t be bothered.’”</li></ul><p class="para"><span>The addicted narcissistic mother’s mantra is best described by Billie Holiday: “Smoke, drink, never think.”<span class="centerImage"><span><a href="part0028.html#en_des_00002_00008"><sup class="calibre3">9</sup></a></span></span></span></p><p class="chapterHeadB"><span>THE SECRETLY MEAN</span></p><p class="paraNoIndent"><span>The secretly mean narcissistic mother does not want others to know she is abusive to her children. She usually has a public self and a private self, which are quite different. Daughters of the secretly mean describe their mothers as being kind, loving, and attentive when out in public, and abusive and cruel at home. It is hard not to feel significant resentment toward your mother for this, especially if she fooled a lot of people outside the family. If you had this mother, you know how awful this inconsistent behavior feels. In church your mother has her arm around you and gives you some gum from her purse with a warm smile. At home, when you ask for the gum, or reach out to her, you get slapped and demeaned. This mother is capable of announcing in public, “I am so proud of my daughter. Isn’t she beautiful?” and then saying at home, “You really should lose some weight, your hair is a mess, and you dress like a slut.” These unpredictable, opposite messages are crazy-making.</span></p><ul class="bulletList"><li class="listItem">Veronica’s mother was a saint in public, but angry and abusive at home. “Whatever she was feeling was the center of the universe and all life had to stop to abide by it. If she had a headache or the blues, we walked on eggshells. Her feelings dominated everything. My feelings were minimized, to put it mildly, and I learned that mine didn’t hold a candle to hers. She would always say, ‘If you only knew…You think you got it bad,’ but whenever we went out somewhere, she acted all loving and really fake. Our battles were inside the home and nobody saw them.”</li><li class="listItem">Robin’s mother’s behavior confused her. “As a kid I had always adored my mom and felt she was on my side, but when my brother and I became teenagers, she used to tell us how awful we were. ‘Don’t ever have children,’ she would say.” Robin’s mother told her stories about how she tried to abort Robin by throwing herself down the stairs and taking certain drugs. “She probably would have aborted my brother,” Robin tells me, “but my father was ready to be sent to war, and in those days if you were pregnant they wouldn’t draft your husband.” Since her mother had had three abortions and one miscarriage, she called Robin and her brother her “live births.” “What was so strange, though, is that in front of others, she always talked about how she loved children and she tried so hard to have the ones she did and what a miracle we were. Huh?”</li><li class="listItem">Hailey relished the freedom of being away from her secretly mean mother after she got married. “Mom didn’t like my husband, so she didn’t want to see us, and it was great! Until one time I decided to go visit her. She was doing caretaking for an elderly lady in the neighborhood, and she would actually say malicious things under her breath about this poor old lady. I went out to lunch with them. The lady was hard of hearing, but it still bothered me that she would say things about this lady right in front of her. ‘Do you think she could move any fucking slower?’ It was so mean. It reminded me of what I had lived with my whole life. There is a nice side and a dark side of my mother. Once this older lady passes, she will project onto the rest of us again. This poor old lady is getting it now.”</li></ul><p class="chapterHeadB"><span>THE EMOTIONALLY NEEDY</span></p><p class="paraNoIndent"><span>While all narcissistic mothers are emotionally needy at some level, some show this characteristic more openly than others. These mothers wear their emotions on their sleeves and expect their daughters to take care of them, a losing proposition for children, who are expected to calm their mothers, listen to their adult problems, and solve problems with her. Of course, these children’s feelings are neglected and you are unlikely to get anywhere near the same nurturance that you are expected to provide.</span></p><ul class="bulletList"><li class="listItem">Ivette’s mother knows how to up the ante. When Ivette tells her she’s tired from working all week, her mother says, “Darling, you don’t know what tired is.” Then her mother goes into a tirade about how exhausting <span class="italic"><span>her</span></span> day was. Rarely can Ivette match her mother’s story, so she just gives up telling her anything and listens. Ivette has learned not to discuss her own feelings, because it is too hurtful. “I just ask her how she is and let it go at that. She seems to get less worked up this way.”</li></ul><p class="para"><span>A classic example of an emotionally needy mother is portrayed in the recent film <span class="italic"><span>The Mother</span></span>. In this dramatic screenplay, written by Hanif Kureishi, the daughter, Paula (Cathryn Bradshaw), feels empty, can’t figure out what to do with her life and career, and has never felt loved or valued by her mother. The daughter is attracted to needy men, having been accustomed to trying to please her mother. Her self-absorbed mother, May (Anne Reid), begins to show the depth of her neediness when her husband dies, and blatantly has an affair with a carpenter, with whom the daughter is madly in love. This mother has no compassion or concern for her daughter’s feelings and would have justified her actions by saying that she was grieving and the affair made her feel better. Movie critic Michael Wilmington says it well: “Self-absorption is the vice of these characters; that, not sex, is their sin.”<span class="centerImage"><span><a href="part0028.html#en_des_00002_00009"><sup class="calibre3">10</sup></a></span></span></span></p><p class="spaceBreak"><span> </span></p><p class="paraNoIndent"><span>Now that you’ve had this inside look at many different types of narcissistic mothers, it is important to emphasize a few things. First of all, our mothers weren’t born this way. They most likely faced insurmountable barriers to love and empathy when they were children. In part 3 of this book, one of your challenges will be to explore your mother’s background, so that you will have a deeper understanding of the reasons for her behavior. This does not take away your pain, but allows you to empathize and forgive her to a degree that will help your recovery.</span></p><p class="para"><span>No narcissist operates in a vacuum.
