It is the intuitive voice that speaks to you and wants to nurture, love, and mother you. While in the past you had to give up on the notion that your external mother could give you what you needed, you can now have an internal mother readily available to you. She makes it possible to parent yourself.</span></p><p class="para"><span>Many daughters are sad and angry when first confronted with the concept of parenting themselves, but when they realize and accept these feelings, they get through them to a sense of inner strength and empowerment.</span></p><p class="para"><span>To grow the internal mother, you must first give her permission to be there. You allow her kind, maternal voice to resonate within you. You allow yourself to hear it. To begin, find a quiet, lovely healing place where you will have solitude. This may be the bathtub, your deck, office, or on a walk. Whatever works for you. Try to create an atmosphere where you will not be interrupted. After you’ve done this several times, you will be able to do this anywhere and even go through interruptions. But start with having complete quiet and focusing on yourself. Have your journal, writing pad, and pencil with you.</span></p><p class="para"><span>Your first task is making what I call the “I am” list. To do this, it is important to allow your internal mother to share and review your many incredible strengths and characteristics. Write them down in a manner similar to these examples:</span></p><p class="para"><span>“I am strong, I am intelligent, I am wise, I am loving, I am helpful, I am empathetic, I am industrious, I am energetic, I am productive, I am sensitive, I am honest, I am a person with integrity, I am talented, I am caring, I am responsible, I am spiritual, I am beautiful inside and out, I am healthy.”</span></p><p class="para"><span>Your next task is to push away negative messages like “I don’t have any good traits.” You know in your heart that you do. If you give her permission, your internal mother will help validate and verify the positive <span class="italic"><span>you</span></span> sitting right there. If the negative thoughts persist, it is a red flag that you have additional grieving and trauma to process and you must go back to first steps. As discussed earlier, reaffirming messages do not “stick” unless you have done the proper grieving.</span></p><p class="para"><span>Your “I am” list is the starting point with your internal mother. Practice being with her. Talk to her often and let her console you. I often tell clients to treat themselves at this point as they would treat a two-year-old child. Be gentle, kind, understanding, and sweet. You so deserve this. When you don’t know what to do, ask yourself how your own maternal self would treat a child with this same emotion or struggle and then do that. When I think of two-year-olds, I think about scooping them up and giving them lots of love and attention. I bet your maternal instinct is similar.</span></p><p class="para"><span>As you practice conferring with your internal mother, she will begin to grow and strengthen. You will feel a committee forming of “me, myself, and I.” The internal mother heads this association. I have found that the times to practice and strengthen the internal mother are in those situations where you want to reach out for help and advice from someone else because you don’t know what to do. This is the time to go internally and find intuitive answers and consolation from the maternal committee. The more that you confer with them, the stronger and more self-assured you become. This mother will never abandon you.</span></p><p class="para"><span>You will particularly need the internal mother when you experience what is called “the collapse.”</span></p><p class="chapterHeadA"><span><span class="bold"><span>The Collapse</span></span></span></p><p class="paraNoIndent"><span>In true narcissism, the narcissist often experiences something called a “narcissistic injury.” According to the <span class="italic"><span>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM):</span></span></span></p><div class="chapterEpigraph"><p class="paraNoIndent"><span>Vulnerability in self-esteem makes individuals with narcissistic personality disorder very sensitive to “injury” from criticism or defeat. Although they may not show it outwardly, criticism may haunt these individuals and may leave them feeling humiliated, degraded, hollow and empty. They may react with disdain, rage, or defiant counterattack.<span class="centerImage"><span><a href="part0028.html#en_des_00010_00002"><sup class="calibre3">3</sup></a></span></span></span></p></div><p class="para"><span>The narcissistic individuals I have known who have had this kind of injury reaction take a long time to get over it; they hold grudges, want to get back at the person they perceived harmed them; they seek revenge, try to cause problems for their attacker, and seem never to forget or forgive. Most daughters of narcissistic mothers with whom I have worked experience a similar condition, although to a much lesser degree, which is called “the collapse.” They feel as if they just popped their self-esteem balloon and all the air rushed out and they need a bit of time to restabilize and refill that balloon. It is different from the narcissist’s injury, because it doesn’t last long and the daughter is able to forgive and forget, and she is not haunted or humiliated for long periods of time. She is also typically not out to get revenge, do paybacks, or seek to harm. The daughter’s collapse is due to her internal sensitivity caused by being insulted and invalidated as a child, adolescent, and adult by her narcissistic mother. When it happens during recovery, it is as if it triggers a momentary regression back to childhood; old memories make the current situation feel much bigger than it really is. This “domino effect” leads to the feeling of internal “collapse,” which is also described as a result of post-traumatic stress disorder, commonly referred to as PTSD. The <span class="italic"><span>DSM</span></span> explains this further:</span></p><div class="chapterEpigraph"><p class="paraNoIndent"><span>The traumatic event is persistently reexperienced in one or more of the following ways…. Intense psychological distress at exposure to internal or external cues that symbolize or resemble an aspect of the traumatic event, and…physiological reactivity on exposure to internal or external cues that symbolize or resemble an aspect of the traumatic event.<span class="centerImage"><span><a href="part0028.html#en_des_00010_00003"><sup class="calibre3">4</sup></a></span></span></span></p></div><p class="para"><span>This means that the daughter will feel the collapse when something reminds her of early childhood wounds. At this moment, a daughter is most tempted to reach out for external validation and ask someone else to make it better for her, and she may act needy. You can manage this differently—without acting needy—by going to your internal mother for support and comfort.</span></p><p class="para"><span>Without naming it, daughters frequently describe “the collapse.” As Felicity told me:</span></p><ul class="bulletList"><li class="listItem">I was recently sitting with a guest at my house who announced to me that he was having one of his employees stop by my house to pick up a work check. I thought this was a bit strange, but certainly okay with me. The employee did stop by, and I welcomed her into my house and offered her a beverage while chatting briefly. We had never met before. When she left, after only about ten minutes, I walked her to the door, and expressed that it was nice to meet her. She responded with “Nice to meet you too, even though you have issues.” I was floored by this inappropriate comment from someone who didn’t even know me. I knew instinctively that it was about something that was going on with her, but it still felt like a punch in the stomach, and that feeling lasted for a whole damn day! Why, Dr. McBride, would I allow this stranger’s inappropriate comment to bother me so?</li></ul><p class="para"><span>As in the past with her mother, Felicity was reminded of years she had tried to be so good and pleasing, to do things right and be kind and polite and then got zapped in the end as never being good enough. This domino effect or collapse took Felicity back to historical wounds, but she handled it by talking to me, her therapist, and a friend. She reached out for external validation in this case, but eventually learned to manage other situations like this on her own, which was her recovery.</span></p><p class="para"><span>Now that you are aware of what the collapse is, you will be better prepared to deal with it when it happens to you. Notice your reactions in the next week; keep track of how many times a collapse actually happens to you. Your increasing awareness will give you increasing strength. You are in charge of you.</span></p><p class="para"><span>Kristal describes another example of a collapse moment:</span></p><ul class="bulletList"><li class="listItem">I stopped by my friend’s house to see if she could babysit for a couple of hours while I ran some errands. We do this for each other often and we are both fine with it. On this particular day, however, my friend, Beth, asked me how long I would be gone because she had laundry to do. That was it. She just set a boundary and asked a simple question, but I immediately interpreted it as her intimating that I was being a burden on her, and she did not want to help me.</li></ul><p class="para"><span>In Kristal’s case, the friend had good boundaries, but what she asked, although not inappropriate, triggered in Kristal feelings of being a burden on her mother, and she had a strong reaction that lasted for several days.</span></p><p class="para"><span>The collapse can cause another problem, as described by Joanie, 36.</span></p><ul class="bulletList"><li class="listItem">We were at a family barbecue and I was sparring with my brother. We do this a lot, but on this day, he actually told me I had gained too much weight and my butt looked big. He always teases me about trying to look “J-Lo-ish,” his term for a great-looking butt and body. But today, he just said, “Big!” I was hurt. I went to my sister and complained to her, and she said, “Why would you let him bother you? He’s just a brat, and who cares what anybody says about your butt? Get over it.” Then, I was not only hurt by my brother, but mad at my sister for not supporting me and giving me sympathy. The thing that bothers me most, though, is that I thought about it for a week and it reminded me so much of the constant criticism and insults from Mom about my weight while growing up.</li></ul><p class="para"><span>Joanie’s experience with her weeklong collapse is interesting. First she was <span class="italic"><span>hurt</span></span> and then <span class="italic"><span>angry</span></span> at not being rescued from her pain. She could have worked on this and shortened her distress if she had strengthened and called on her internal mother, who could have comforted her immediately. Instead, she did not get the validation for her feelings that she needed until she came to therapy a week later. Again, getting support is a good thing, and we all need it on occasion, but you can save a week of feeling bad by building up your self-reliance—your internal mother.</span></p><p class="chapterHeadA"><span><span class="bold"><span>The Sensitive One</span></span></span></p><p class="paraNoIndent"><span>Daughters were often called “the sensitive one” in the family. They tire of people telling them that they are overreacting to things said or done by other people. Daughters of narcissistic mothers have to work on freeing themselves of this tie to their past. You will feel more normal and less crazy when you understand that any temporary collapse is a normal reaction to a trigger from your history. When you can identify and understand it, you can also work to relieve it and prevent it from recurring. Otherwise, you may tend to beat up on yourself for letting things bother you and buying into the old “you’re the sensitive one” script.</span></p><ul class="bulletList"><li class="listItem">Deadra, 35, tells me, “Feelings were generally not allowed in our family, so whenever I had some feeling going on and tried to express it, I was told that I was being too sensitive. That usually shut me down, but I didn’t know what to do with the feelings that were left inside of me.”</li><li class="listItem">Melodie, 42, said, “I’m so sick of people telling me I’m oversensitive! My mother said that to me anytime I showed even one little feeling growing up. I know it is because she couldn’t deal with my feelings and so she wouldn’t allow them. Now, when my husband or children say the same to me, I just want to bop them. I want to be real and have whatever feelings I have and quit worrying about it.”</li></ul><p class="para"><span>Now that you understand why you need to strengthen the internal mother and recognize your being at risk for periodic emotional collapses, you are ready to start reinventing yourself. After the painful work of prior chapters, the rest of this chapter should be fun and entertaining. For the exercises that follow, you need only your own approval and that of your internal mother, who is always on your side, no matter what. Let’s get started, so you can discover your passions and preferences, which you may have kept under wraps before now, when it was “all about Mom.” You will be asking yourself questions such as:</span></p><ul class="bulletList"><li class="listItem">What do I value most?</li><li class="listItem">What makes me happy?</li><li class="listItem">What gives me the deepest sense of fulfillment?</li><li class="listItem">What are my passions and talents?</li></ul><p class="chapterHeadA"><span><span class="bold"><span>Who Am I Really?</span></span></span></p><p class="paraNoIndent"><span>Because daughters of narcissistic mothers have been forced into supporting roles demanded by their mothers and the narcissistic family system, it is not uncommon for them to say they don’t really know who they are or what they like. They have become accustomed to doing for others and not focusing on themselves in healthy ways. As Mei tells me, “The message I got from Mom is that she will love me if I do what she thinks I should do. So I try to be me, but I don’t know who I am.”</span></p><p class="para"><span>To begin the discovery process, it is important to know the basics of what you like and what you believe in. To do this, I am going to suggest two exercises to get you started.</span></p><p class="chapterHeadA"><span><span class="bold"><span>Real-Woman Collage</span></span></span></p><p class="paraNoIndent"><span>Although not new or innovative, this exercise is helpful for women beginning to think about themselves in a different way. To do this exercise, get a poster board or piece of construction paper and several women’s magazines. Start thumbing through the magazines to find pictures of women who represent womanhood to you. Pay attention to what you choose: Are the images representing what you really desire or what your mother or someone else thinks you should be? Cut out only those images or pictures that represent what you believe are symbols of positive, adult womanhood to you, representations of who you are and who you want to become when you allow yourself to show forth. When you have found images that fit you, make a collage of them on the paper. Keep this collage as a reminder of where you are going with your re-creation or finding of yourself.</span></p><p class="chapterHeadA"><span><span class="bold"><span>What Are My Values?</span></span></span></p><p class="paraNoIndent"><span>This exercise assists you in reminding yourself what you believe in and determining what you like. You will make a list of beliefs on your desires and preferences. I will give you my starting list, and you can add to it as you think of beliefs on which you want to focus. The categories will be a combination of simple, seemingly unimportant things and huge, significant life philosophies. For each category, it is your job to write what is your style, preference or belief.</span></p><ul class="bulletList"><li class="listItem">Education: your beliefs and philosophy about education for yourself and your family</li><li class="listItem">Politics: your political beliefs</li><li class="listItem">Religion: your religious or spiritual beliefs</li><li class="listItem">Parenting belief system: How do you want to raise your children and what are your priorities as a mother?</li><li class="listItem">Love relationship: What are the most important things to you in a love relationship?</li><li class="listItem">Men: Who is the ideal man for you; what are his characteristics?</li><li class="listItem">Friends: What kind of friends are you attracted to?</li><li class="listItem">Movies: What kind of movies do you like best?</li><li class="listItem">Books: What kind of books are your favorites?</li><li class="listItem">Jewelry: What is your style of jewelry?</li><li class="listItem">Fashion: What is your style of clothing?</li><li class="listItem">Cars: If you could buy whatever cars you wanted, which two would you choose?</li><li class="listItem">Architecture and house style: What kind of architecture do you like?</li><li class="listItem">Furniture: What are your favorite kinds of furniture?</li><li class="listItem">Gemstone: your favorite gemstones</li><li class="listItem">Weather: your favorite weather</li><li class="listItem">Geography: your favorite landscape</li><li class="listItem">Season: Which of the seasons is your favorite and why?</li><li class="listItem">Music for listening: What kind of music do you like for pure listening and pleasure?</li><li class="listItem">Music for dancing: What is your favorite dance music?</li><li class="listItem">Leisure-time activity: What leisure-time activity do you like most?</li><li class="listItem">Kick-up-your-heels fun: What activity do you love that brings you sheer joy?</li><li class="listItem">Exercise: your favorite kind of exercise</li><li class="listItem">Television show: What do you like to watch on television?</li><li class="listItem">Food: your favorite foods to cook and eat</li><li class="listItem">Restaurant: When you dine out, where do you most like to go?</li><li class="listItem">Shopping place: What is your favorite shopping place?</li><li class="listItem">Vacation: your ideal vacation</li><li class="listItem">Sports to play: If you play sports, which do you enjoy most?</li><li class="listItem">Sports to watch: If you watch sports, what is your favorite?</li><li class="listItem">Color: What is your favorite color for wearing and decorating?</li><li class="listItem">Fabrics: What is your favorite fabric for wearing and decorating?</li><li class="listItem">Flowers: your favorite flowers</li><li class="listItem">Conversation: your favorite kind of conversation; about what and with whom?</li><li class="listItem">Favorite age group: What age group do you most like to hang out with?</li></ul><p class="para"><span>Add more as you go. The purpose here is to be writing and thinking about yourself through your thoughts, desires, preferences, beliefs, and values. We rarely take time to stop and ask ourselves these kinds of questions, and you will be surprised at how much “self” you already have and how much you do really know about you.</span></p><p class="chapterHeadA"><span><span class="bold"><span>If I Were Good Enough</span></span></span></p><p class="paraNoIndent"><span>The next exercise can be very helpful if you spend time on it and think carefully about it. At the top of a page in your journal, you write the heading “If I Were Good Enough.” Then write about the things you would do if you felt good enough right now. “If I were good enough, I would———.” Keep at this until you have written at least ten things. I’m always surprised when I do this myself, as I find it can change from year to year. It is also a useful way to demonstrate that you have vanquished the old negative internal messages and that they are not controlling your choices any longer.</span></p><p class="para"><span>After doing this exercise, read it to someone who loves you and get his or her reaction. Allow your internal mother to digest it as well. Then start doing the things on that list.</span></p><p class="chapterHeadA"><span><span class="bold"><span>Finding Your Interests in a Memory Exercise</span></span></span></p><p class="paraNoIndent"><span>It worries me when I ask women what they are interested in and they say they don’t know. If this is the case for you, I want you to take some quiet time to think about what you liked to do as a small child. What kinds of things did you play with? Sometimes you can take a childhood activity and transfer it to an adult activity that fits your current interests beautifully. For example, when I did this, I remembered that before I turned seven, we lived in the country and rode Shetland ponies. I loved the horses and the countryside, but they also reminded me of country dancing and country music and I threw myself into those activities again. They are two of my favorite pastimes now. I also used to love to play paper dolls, which translates into a love of clothes and fashion today. Try this remembering exercise and see what you come up with.</span></p><p class="para"><span>Perhaps you are aware of what interests you have but do not allow yourself the time to explore them or experience fun. To get in touch with the real you, you have to involve the child side of you to laugh and have a really good time. Don’t deny this core part of you any longer. Find what it is for you. Allow yourself both leisure-time enjoyment and what I call “kick up your heels” kind of fun. An example of these two different activities for me would be attending a spectacular musical, which I would find very enjoyable, versus dancing with a great dancer to my favorite music, which would be “kick up your heels” fun. You may love rock climbing for three days in the wilderness, but your girlfriend may prefer a Ritz-Carlton kind of vacation. Find out what constitutes pleasure and enjoyment and what is out-of-control, belly-laughing fun for you.</span></p><p class="para"><span>When you do figure out your specific interests, then it is time to set up your schedule to include them in your life. You may suddenly be taking piano lessons or dance lessons or ski lessons. A client of mine recently started belly dancing and loves it—it’s great exercise and she laughs and has fun. Her husband likes it, too, when she has to practice at home. You may find that you want to explore some new things but have no one to do it with. If this is the case, it is important to make yourself do them alone. Going to movies, dancing, hiking, walking—whatever it is—do it alone. The time you spend with yourself is very important in improving your self-understanding and self-reliance. Time alone may seem like a luxury, but I assure you that this time spent on your own interests is very important to your recovery.</span></p><p class="para"><span>Your age should never be a factor. I am working with several women in their fifties, sixties, and seventies who are just now getting to do things they always wanted to do and are finding great joy.</span></p><p class="para"><span>Keep a list of the true interests you discover in your recovery journal. It helps to refer back to them and take encouragement from this aspect of your recovery whenever you find that you also have to do some painful processing. Recovery can have a fun side—in fact, it has to—so be sure to include this part. Being nice to yourself is a gift that you and your internal mother can provide regularly and reliably, as no one else can. Give permission! Don’t allow yourself to get caught up in believing that taking care of yourself and enjoying yourself is selfish. On the contrary, it is a vital, necessary part of your recovery.</span></p><p class="chapterHeadA"><span><span class="bold"><span>Actually, Let’s Talk About Selfish</span></span></span></p><p class="paraNoIndent"><span>Many daughters in recovery have been taught by their narcissistic mothers and our patriarchal culture that focusing on their own needs is selfish. Women are the primary “caretakers” of others and are asked to be in a giving mode at all times. And daughters of narcissistic mothers have also been treated as if they were not worthy of loving care. But, remember, you can’t give what you don’t have. People who are fulfilled have an overflow of love and energy and therefore can give freely of themselves to others without becoming exhausted. Their own tanks are full and charged, and they have energy to spare. If your spirit and energy are chronically depleted, if you are unhappy and unfulfilled, you will find it difficult to care for others. Thomas J. Leonard, personal coach and founder of Coach University, said it best:</span></p><div class="chapterEpigraph"><p class="paraNoIndent"><span>Creativity and excellence require selfishness. So does evolution. When you know you’re onto something—a potential breakthrough of any kind—you need the purest kind of focus and concentration possible. You need to answer to the callings of your heart and mind before you answer to the callings of the tribe. You need to accept that a reasonable and responsible level of selfishness builds long-term benefits for everyone you care about.<span class="centerImage"><span><a href="part0028.html#en_des_00010_00004"><sup class="calibre3">5</sup></a></span></span></span></p></div><p class="chapterHeadA"><span><span class="bold"><span>Physical Health</span></span></span></p><p class="paraNoIndent"><span>Although I am not a medical doctor, this chapter would not be complete without mentioning the importance of your physical health. Because some daughters are at risk for sabotaging themselves and engaging in self-destructive behaviors, I want you to accept fully that taking good care of your health is mandatory. Sound mental health and recovery is not possible without your physical well-being. I will list only general health areas to make sure that you include these in your recovery plan. If you are not attending to one or more entries in the list below, ask yourself why and figure out the barrier so that you can overcome it. If you are having difficulty with something like an addiction, find an additional recovery program to enter so that you are getting the help you need. I compiled the following list after consulting with family practice physician James Gregory, M.D.<span class="centerImage"><span><a href="part0028.html#en_des_00010_00005"><sup class="calibre3">6</sup></a></span></span></span></p><ul class="bulletList"><li class="listItem">Have a complete physical examination that includes a thorough history and set up an individual health plan with general testing related to your age requirements. Some examples are: a colonoscopy after age 50 and a bone density test after age 60.</li><li class="listItem">Eat a balanced, nutritious diet.</li><li class="listItem">Drink plenty of water (48 ounces of water daily, by eight-ounce glass).</li><li class="listItem">Exercise regularly for at least 30 minutes, three times a week or more often. Include resistance training, e.g., weightlifting, in order to preserve bone density as well as aerobic exercise for general health.</li><li class="listItem">Get regular dental examinations and cleanings twice a year.</li><li class="listItem">Get adequate sleep at night. The amount of sleep varies with individual needs, but most physicians now recommend seven to eight hours a night. If you are tired, it means you need more. If you have good energy throughout the day, you are probably getting enough.</li><li class="listItem">Address problems of excessive consumption. Eating too much, smoking, taking drugs, and drinking alcohol to excess are, of course, detrimental to long-term health.</li></ul><p class="chapterHeadA"><span><span class="bold"><span>Talent Search</span></span></span></p><p class="paraNoIndent"><span>The next area to assess is your talent. We are all born with some innate talent. It is your job to figure out what that talent is and pursue it if you desire. I have talked to many daughters of narcissistic mothers who are wildly talented in some area but have never pursued their talent because they do not believe in themselves. Some daughters are very aware of their talents because their mothers pushed them like showbiz moms, but are now burned out and not using what they know and can do. Others were never encouraged.</span></p><p class="para"><span>If you have a special gift and want to use it, pursue it, and try it again, do so. Work on grieving and healing any memories connected with your mother that are preventing you from following your talent, reconnecting with it, picking it up again. Life is short and you were given certain aptitudes for a reason. You don’t have to be a superstar. Whatever you do will be good enough. This exercise is not meant for anyone else. This is for you! One daughter I worked with, a talented artist, did not want to paint and sell or start her own gallery, but she did want to use her talent. She ended up volunteering in art classes at her neighborhood school and loved it. Another daughter had a beautiful singing voice and started singing in the church choir. You can be very creative with how you use your talents. Allow the full you to be in operation now.</span></p><p class="chapterHeadA"><span><span class="bold"><span>Indulge Your Passions</span></span></span></p><p class="paraNoIndent"><span>Not everyone has a passion, but if you do, don’t let this world go by without at least trying your hand at whatever brings you deep excitement and purpose. You must explore the things that stir your soul. You do not have to be the best at anything. You can strive to be the best if you choose to, but it is your choice now. You are good enough to try to do whatever you want. You are driving the bus of your own life journey.</span></p><p class="para"><span>My passion is dance. I have dabbled in it for years and dance whenever I can. When I finish writing this book, I plan to explore every avenue of dance I can. This passion will take me into retirement doing something I dearly love. That’s what I hope for you too.</span></p><p class="para"><span>Sit with your journal now and write about anything that brings you life and excitement. What is your deep personal interest and desire? Make yourself get in touch with a passion even if you feel like you don’t have one.
