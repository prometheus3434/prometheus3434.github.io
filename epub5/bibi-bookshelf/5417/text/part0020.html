When your first child enters the world, you enter the new state of “permanent parenthood” and remain there forever. For most women, the experience of bearing a child is blessed with intoxicating excitement and anticipatory visions for the future. For daughters of narcissistic mothers, however, it can also be blighted by unrelenting fear and anxiety.</span></p><p class="para"><span>The fear is of being like Mother, of emotionally orphaning your children or harming them in some other way. You worry about not feeling good enough to do the job—whether because you carry that nagging belief around with you everywhere, or because you know you lack certain skills you will need as a parent. Perhaps you haven’t yet fully come into your own identity. Whatever its origin, your fear is very real.</span></p><ul class="bulletList"><li class="listItem">Mattie’s apprehensions about becoming a mother brought her into therapy. “Getting pregnant was the scariest thing ever for me. I didn’t have a need to be pregnant and have kids. I wasn’t even sure I wanted kids. I was worried that I would be a horrible mother, like mine was, emotionally and physically abusive. Would I be? What if I turned out to be just as crazy as she?”</li><li class="listItem">For Kylie, having a child brought back many memories of her childhood. “My mother did not connect with me. I felt like she never saw me.” Kylie felt that she had to give her daughter what she hadn’t received. “Whenever my daughter would make a sound,” she told me, “I would say, ‘I see you, Lacy. I see you.’”</li><li class="listItem">Lavonda reports, “I was so excited when I first got pregnant but very worried, too, that I was going to mess up my kids. I did a lot of therapy while I was pregnant and wanted to have a big talk with my mom then, but my therapist advised me not to. I so wanted my mother to hear me, but my therapist made me realize it was unlikely that this would happen. I mostly worried that I would be narcissistic too. I don’t want to smother my baby like my mother did me.”</li><li class="listItem">As a young adult, Mia felt very much alone. “I was alone, sad, empty, and involved with drugs and alcohol. I would picture having a family and cry about it. Since I’ve had my own family, I don’t feel quite so empty, but I know I fill the emptiness by being the mother that I <span class="italic"><span>wanted</span></span> rather than the mother that I <span class="italic"><span>had.</span></span>”</li><li class="listItem">Sidney relates this story: “I still have fears that I will be like her. My ex-husband says that I have traits of my mother. One time, he said I looked like her because I was smoking a little cigarillo, and he said, ‘You are just as pretentious as your mother.’ I never touched those again. I turned pale and put it out. I just hope I am not like my mother in my parenting style!”</li></ul><p class="para"><span>To have worries and fears about your parenting is normal, but the women above have concerns that are a few steps beyond those of most mothers-to-be. Of course, we strive to do the right things for our children, and none of us wants to pass along our own undesirable legacy. Breaking the cycle is a challenge when you have no positive role model as a mother. Daughters of narcissistic mothers often feel as if we are blazing our own trail of love in raising <span class="italic"><span>our</span></span> babies.</span></p><p class="para"><span>If you see yourself making mistakes in parenting, don’t panic. You don’t have to be afraid even if you have learned or inherited some narcissistic parenting traits. This does not mean that you are narcissistic. You <span class="italic"><span>can</span></span> change. The best thing you can do for yourself and your family is to allow yourself the awareness of possible mistakes you could make or have made, and work to correct them. This chapter is designed specifically to look at the pitfalls many of us face.</span></p><p class="chapterHeadA"><span><span class="bold"><span>Warning: The Risk of Doing the Opposite</span></span></span></p><p class="paraNoIndent"><span>If a daughter swings to the other end of the continuum and acts the opposite of her mother, she stands a good chance of creating the same dynamics that she’s trying so hard to avoid. The key lies in finding a middle ground on which you can stand as a loving parent with your own values.</span></p><p class="para"><span>Typically when we want to change something, we think in black and white terms. Let’s say you want to work on explosive anger and aggressive behavior. You switch to the opposite end of the emotional spectrum and start behaving in passive, meek, quiet, nonassertive ways. Being explosively angry means you are stuffing feelings until they explode, and being passive and nonassertive probably means you are not expressing your emotions either. Your goal is to go to the middle and become assertive, but it takes a while to get there.</span></p><p class="para"><span>If you want to parent in different ways from your mother, remember that the middle ground you find ultimately needs to be based on <span class="italic"><span>your</span></span> value system and beliefs, but it can indeed include some of your mother’s beliefs. For instance: Maybe you like a clean house, as did your mother, or you plan to stay with the same religious denomination, or have strong beliefs about the importance of education, but you want to parent with a special ear for your child’s emotional needs, which is likely very different from your mother. You don’t completely throw the baby out with the bathwater and just go the total opposite direction with everything. We begin to see mistakes when we do this.</span></p><p class="para"><span>If you had an engulfing mother, for instance, you may decide you will absolutely not be a smothering mother, but end up doing the opposite, so the child feels ignored on some level. Jaime tried too hard not to smother her daughter, Chelsea, and on the first day of kindergarten her little girl, who had just turned five, was found crying in the classroom. She wanted her mother to sit with the class for a while like some of the other parents. Jaime, bound and determined not to be an overprotective mom like her own mother, had gone overboard the opposite way.</span></p><p class="para"><span>If you had an ignoring mother, you may decide to give your child so much attention that you end up engulfing her. Rosaline found that she could not let her child alone. “I had to be involved in everything she did and everywhere she went because I was so afraid she would think I didn’t care like I felt with my mother. When she was twelve, she set me straight by telling me to get a life, as she was kind of sick of me.”</span></p><p class="para"><span>Another example may be how you handle praising your child. You were never praised or encouraged, so you overdo it with your children. Terra created a situation where her daughter not only felt entitled, but also believed she could never measure up. “My sixteen-year-old broke down in tears the other day. I sat with her immediately and began to tell her all the wonderful things I could think of and how awesome she was. I found out that I was ‘overpraising’ her and she felt like she was a fake in trying to please me and that she could never measure up to all the things I thought about her. Damn. I over-did it, I guess. I was trying to be so different from my mother.”</span></p><ul class="bulletList"><li class="listItem">Marlene’s mother was very strict and did not allow her children the freedom of speech, space, and choices they needed. She decided to be super lenient with her children, and they turned out to be kids with no boundaries, unable to manage their own behavior. “I was bound and determined to let my kids be. I wanted them to feel total freedom and not be caged and stifled like I was as a child. But I soon discovered that all that freedom led two of my daughters to getting in trouble with the law and enough speeding tickets and accidents to break my pocketbook in insurance and car repair bills. I guess I should not have gone that far.”</li></ul><p class="para"><span>This is tricky business. Parenting is tough, and of course none of us do it perfectly, but these stories show how easy it is to pass along a dysfunction when we think we are doing exactly the opposite of how we were reared.</span></p><p class="chapterHeadA"><span><span class="bold"><span>Modeling the Not-Good-Enough Message</span></span></span></p><p class="paraNoIndent"><span>Sometimes we are able to find that middle ground and what we do with our children reflects that. If you succeeded in this, give yourself credit; you deserve lots of it. One pitfall to finding the middle ground, however, is the internal belief that we ourselves are <span class="italic"><span>not good enough.</span></span> If you carry this unhealthy message within yourself, you are most likely modeling it for your children. You will show them inadvertently, through your behavior, that you feel unworthy, and they will grow to feel the same way about themselves. This can happen even if you don’t really believe it or ever say it to them. Remember, children learn more through what they see in us than through what we tell them. If you model in yourself a woman who does not take good care of herself or who stays in unhealthy relationships, feeling you don’t deserve better, or you do not pursue your own passions, don’t be surprised if you see the same in your children. Similarly, if you set boundaries and stand up for yourself, your children most likely will too. This is the best reason there is to embrace recovery.</span></p><p class="chapterHeadA"><span><span class="bold"><span>How Do You Spell “Empathy”?</span></span></span></p><p class="paraNoIndent"><span>Many daughters who didn’t get empathy from their mothers do not know how to give it to their children. The ability to empathize is the most important parenting skill there is. Nothing makes you feel more real, heard, and understood than someone who empathizes with you in a time of need.</span></p><p class="para"><span>If this skill was neither modeled nor taught well in your family of origin, you will need to work to develop it. Shay, a pensive, insightful, and highly educated woman who was raised by an ignoring narcissistic mother, has four children now and a loving husband. They were all in my office for family therapy to learn about healthy communication following a suicide in their extended family that had frightened them all. Every single family member present that day was committed, but Shay was particularly worried. Aware of her unmet childhood needs with her own mother, she didn’t have a clue how to empathize with her own children, who told her, in session, that she “sucked” at this. Shay spent many months working on developing the skill of expressing empathy.</span></p><p class="para"><span>Kami, 45, came to therapy to increase her empathy for her seventeen-year-old daughter, who was pregnant. She realized she was having trouble being there for her child. An insightful, intelligent woman raised by an image-oriented narcissistic mother, Kami found herself overly concerned about what her friends and family would think. She was not narcissistic, was aware of her childhood issues, but still couldn’t shake some of her ingrained messages. She seemed to talk to me from two sides of her being. One side was angry, humiliated, and shamed by her daughter’s actions, and the other side was humane and loving and wanted to do right by her. She clearly did the right thing in seeking assistance in how to let her own issues rest and tune in to her daughter’s needs at the time. Today Kami is a proud grandmother, and her daughter speaks highly of her mother’s nurturing ability.</span></p><p class="chapterHeadA"><span><span class="bold"><span>My Kid the Honor Student</span></span></span></p><p class="paraNoIndent"><span>How many of these bumper stickers have we seen? Where are the bumper stickers that say “My kid has a big heart,” “My kid is honest,” “My kid is kind”? A significant problem I see in my practice today is too many parents unable or unwilling to tune in to who their child is as a person. As a daughter of a narcissistic mother, you should beware of this major pitfall. Your child’s accomplishments are not who your child is.</span></p><p class="para"><span>Abbie, 47, came to a therapy session worried about her son who was the quarterback on the high school football team, first chair in an honors band, an honor student, and a great-looking kid to boot. Eventually she reported that this great kid had just been arrested and was in juvenile detention for pointing a gun at another student at a lakeside party over the weekend. When she went to visit him in jail, he was crying and told her that he felt too much pressure to succeed in everything and always felt he had to be the best. He wanted to prove that he was just a normal guy who got in trouble sometimes. While this kind of getting in trouble was over the edge, Abbie learned to see past the accomplishments and into her son’s anxieties and fears.</span></p><p class="para"><span>Dori was worried about her daughter because the fourteen-year-old had just been picked up for shoplifting: “How can this kid, who is a total star in her musical abilities, be doing such a stupid thing as shoplifting? She has a recital on Friday. How could she?”</span></p><p class="para"><span>Obviously Dori should have been thinking more along the lines of “What is going on in my young daughter’s feelings? What does she feel she is missing? Does she not feel worthy? There has to be a reason that she is sabotaging her talent and I want to find out why.” At the time, Dori had a way to go in learning empathy.</span></p><p class="chapterHeadA"><span><span class="bold"><span>Those Messy Things Called Feelings</span></span></span></p><p class="paraNoIndent"><span>It’s easy to understand the need for authenticity until your own child shows authentic feelings and you don’t like what she is saying or feeling. This is particularly difficult if she expresses negative feelings about you. Allowing authenticity in children will be discussed more in part 3, but here are some examples of how not allowing your child to be authentic can get you in trouble as a parent.</span></p><p class="para"><span>Alexis, who had been taught as a child not to deal with authentic feelings, has two daughters, both of whom are now involved in drugs. She came to therapy asking for help without having ever talked to her daughters about this issue. I asked her if she had confronted the drug abuse, and she told me, “Oh, no, what would I say to them? Do I really want to know?”</span></p><p class="para"><span>Fiona’s thirteen-year-old daughter recently informed her that she had been sexually abused. The girl had been afraid to tell her mother the real story because the perpetrator was a family member. Fiona came to therapy wanting not to believe her daughter and to shove the whole issue under the rug. I worked with Fiona so that she could listen to her little girl and get to the bottom of what had happened to her. Lack of authenticity can truly be dangerous.</span></p><p class="chapterHeadA"><span><span class="bold"><span>My Daughter, My Friend</span></span></span></p><p class="paraNoIndent"><span>You may be thinking, “I want to have my daughter as a friend. I crave this closeness. I didn’t have this with my mother. Please don’t tell me this is wrong. What is the right way?” Even when your daughter becomes an adult, you must still be the mother. You will continue to have parenting duties and need to provide guidance, empathy, and understanding. It is not your daughter’s job to give that to you.</span></p><p class="para"><span>Jan, a mother of three girls, brought her oldest two to therapy because they were displaying signs of anger that she didn’t understand. I asked Jan to leave the room so I could sit with the girls and chat. As soon as Jan left my office, the girls both made a disgusting gesture toward her. I knew then we were in for some kind of mother-daughter train wreck. I had expected that the girls were probably not getting the cell phones, cars, clothes or freedom they wanted, but the issue was very different. They both told me that Jan expected them to help her get over her depression, and they were totally exasperated and feeling helpless. They reported that each day when they came home from school, they sat with their mother and listened to her sadness, crying, and desperation and they were sick of it. Jan had grown up with a psychosomatic narcissistic mother, so she knew better, but she was falling into a similar pattern with her children in expecting them to take care of her emotionally. Luckily, the situation was easily turned around and Jan went back into psychotherapy. However, one can see that, even with education and awareness, adult daughters of narcissistic mothers can unwittingly fall into the legacy of narcissistic behaviors.</span></p><p class="chapterHeadA"><span><span class="bold"><span>Take Care of Yourself but Stay Connected to Others</span></span></span></p><p class="paraNoIndent"><span>Although healthy self-care is central to the recovery of daughters of narcissistic mothers, self-care does not mean becoming self-absorbed. Taking care of yourself does not mean tuning out others’ feelings. I have seen daughters make the mistake of misinterpreting self-care to mean they should focus on themselves in unhealthy ways, even after they saw how harmful their mother’s belief was that everything was “all about Mom.”</span></p><p class="para"><span>Marni had three children at home, but decided that instead of giving those children the time and attention they needed, her recovery mission was to take care of herself with luxurious clothing, fancy trips, and expensive jewelry. When her kids were brought to therapy for acting out and getting in trouble with the law, she was on the beach somewhere getting a nice suntan. The kids were angry and also surprised because this was not typical behavior. Again, Marni knew better and had done some of her own recovery work but had not understood this part very well. Family therapy was very effective, because as soon as she heard how her children were feeling, she set about to truly understand what she needed to do for herself and them.</span></p><p class="para"><span>Healthy self-care means finding fulfillment so that you have energy, love, and empathy for others. Finding the middle ground means realizing that it is not an either-or situation—you are neither full of self nor drained of self.</span></p><p class="para"><span>Part 3 will teach you how to do this. Having established an understanding of how maternal narcissism creates certain negative dynamics in the mother-daughter relationship that affect daughters’ lives as adults, we are now ready to step onto the path to recovery.</span></p></div></div></body></html>
