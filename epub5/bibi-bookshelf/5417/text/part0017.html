I wish someone had told me it wouldn’t fill the bill as I imagined it would. The hard-work escape sounded good at the time.</span></p><p class="chapterEpigraphSource"><span>—Kerry, 35</span></p></div></div><div class="centerImage"><p class="chapterOpenerText"><span><span class="chapterOpenerFirstLetters"><span><span class="bold"><span>T</span></span></span></span>he high-achieving daughter, whom I call Mary Marvel,<span class="centerImage"><span><a href="part0028.html#en_des_00005_00000"><sup class="calibre3">1</sup></a></span></span> embarks on a whirlwind of achievement, out to prove to her mother and to the world just how good she can be. “I am worthy,” she is trying to tell herself and her mother, “because of the extraordinarily impressive things I can accomplish.” She finds it difficult to love herself just for who she is. She bases her worth on her accomplishment and her busyness. When not accomplishing something she (or others) thinks is great, she feels worthless. The high achiever becomes a “human doing” rather than a “human being” who is accepted for and comfortable just being herself.</span></p><p class="para"><span>Such women appear to be superheroes, but their productivity and achievement don’t make them feel accomplished or comfortable on the inside. They never give themselves the credit they deserve and continually struggle with feelings of inadequacy. Constantly looking for more things they can do to prove themselves, they are often chronically exhausted, unaware of how this drive to achieve inhibits their ability to take care of themselves. Mary Marvels can be highly educated and professional or stay-at-home, perfectionist homemakers, but they feel nothing they do is ever good enough.</span></p><p class="para"><span>Are you a Mary Marvel? One way to identify whether you are is to look at how you define yourself. Do you typically describe yourself as who you are: “I am a loving, kind person who strives to be honest and to live a life that contributes to society in some significant way”? Or is your identity more closely tied to what you do: “I am a CEO for a large manufacturing firm, I am a business owner, I am an attorney, or I am a mother of four and a Girl Scout leader who also teaches Sunday school”?</span></p><p class="para"><span>You might have learned that you had to be a doer for your mother in order to be accepted or approved. If your mother was an “accomplishment-oriented” narcissist, as discussed in chapter 3, you grew up emulating this role model and following the rule that you had to “achieve to be worthy.” Even though this was expected of you, however, your accomplishments don’t really make you feel good about yourself. For no matter how much you try to accomplish and perform, you still hear the internal message: It’s not enough.</span></p><p class="para"><span>This attitude is frustrating, sad, and difficult. There is always a push to do more, but doing more makes you feel better about yourself only temporarily. So you up the ante, hoping somehow that it <span class="italic"><span>will</span></span> work in the end. Most daughters of narcissistic mothers don’t understand the origins of this impulse, but feel they need to keep it up. As Pressman and Pressman say in their book, <span class="italic"><span>The Narcissistic Family</span></span>, “The roots of workaholism are truly sown in narcissistic homes; ‘I do, therefore I am’ could be the motto of many adult children from these homes.”<span class="centerImage"><span><a href="part0028.html#en_des_00005_00001"><sup class="calibre3">2</sup></a></span></span></span></p><ul class="bulletList"><li class="listItem">Rosa is a pretty but harried-looking woman who is constantly doing more than her fair share of work within any group. She explains, “I have to work so hard to justify just being here—have to do and do and do.”</li><li class="listItem">Mother of three and a college professor, Jerilyn started on her path during the early years. She relates, “I’ve been doing this race for the good since I was a kid. Straight A’s, AP classes in high school, every sport offered, in all the music programs, honors programs, straight to college and then on to grad school. It all looks great, but somehow it feels like I am trying to prove something to justify my existence.”</li></ul><p class="para"><span>I have to admit this category fits me. Sometimes I have been able to give myself credit for what I have accomplished, but even when I’ve done so, I still feel something might be missing. Throughout my life, it would actually make me angry when others asked why I was doing something more—another degree, another business idea, another major project. You yourself probably won’t really be able to explain it to yourself until you complete recovery and uncover all the dynamics behind it. We daughters may try to explain ourselves as being type A personalities, or just overly ambitious. But inside, we know that our personal rat race has another cause. A recurring dream I had in my early years before graduate school illustrates this unconscious compulsion always to work harder and get it right:</span></p><p class="para"><span>I am standing in front of a mirror in the bedroom trying to get dressed. As I am trying on several different outfits in arduous, frustrating slow motion, nothing looks right or is working correctly. I keep changing clothes, regardless. A voice in the hall outside the bedroom is calling me: “Come on, you’re okay just the way you are.”</span></p><p class="para"><span>I misinterpreted this dream for years, thinking it had something to do with my husband’s impatience with me when we were getting ready to go somewhere. I ultimately realized, however, that the voice in the hall was my intuition calling to me, voicing the validation that I am okay as I am.</span></p><p class="chapterHeadA"><span><span class="bold"><span>So, What Does This Mean?</span></span></span></p><p class="paraNoIndent"><span>If you fit the description of a Mary Marvel, you may be asking the question “But what if my choices are mine and I am doing what I want, although it just happens to be a higher level of achievement than many people care to pursue? Is this wrong?” Of course, a significant number of high achievers <span class="italic"><span>are</span></span> doing things they really want to do. Many daughters of narcissistic mothers who took the Mary Marvel route are truly accomplished, amazing women, and I honor their multitude of talents. In fact, sometimes the narcissistic mother’s legacy ends up being a gift that provides you with an inner drive that others may not have. One woman, an exceptionally talented artist, explained it this way:</span></p><div class="chapterEpigraph"><p class="paraNoIndent"><span>I’ve always felt that my art was something “untouchable”; my narcissistic mother could not affect it because it was an inner event and therefore not subject to her influence. It was a private joy that flourished and thrived as I grew. I had to spend so much time on the inside of myself, not disturbing her, being quiet and unseen, that my drawing abilities sort of became a natural outgrowth of that. If I had to come up with a positive result of growing up in a narcissistic home, that would top my list.</span></p></div><p class="para"><span>If you are a high achiever pursuing your chosen life dreams, <span class="italic"><span>and</span></span> you are giving yourself credit and taking good care of yourself in the process, you are doing it <span class="italic"><span>so</span></span> right. High achievement becomes a problem only when you:</span></p><ul class="bulletList"><li class="listItem">Have medical or mental health problems associated with not taking care of yourself.</li><li class="listItem">Seek only external validation to define your self-worth.</li><li class="listItem">Find that you cannot give yourself credit for what you accomplish in all aspects of your life.</li></ul><p class="para"><span>Let’s look at each of these Mary Marvel pitfalls so that you can make sure they have not entrapped you or, if they have, so that you can take steps to climb out of them.</span></p><p class="chapterHeadA"><span><span class="bold"><span>Lack of Self-Care</span></span></span></p><p class="paraNoIndent"><span>Busyness or workaholism can be a form of self-destructive behavior similar to alcoholism and drug or food addiction. It works the same to numb the pain. If you become chronically exhausted, and find that you can’t slow down, and are beginning to have health problems, it is time to take an inventory of whether or not your activities fit your own value system (rather than your mother’s or your internalized critic) and whether they are healthy for you. Looking strong and invulnerable on the outside may be an attempt to escape the emptiness and pain of feelings of unworthiness on the inside. Here are some women who have begun to come to terms with this behavior:</span></p><ul class="bulletList"><li class="listItem">Summer feels valued for what she does rather than who she is. “I’m a workhorse. I’m like this because my mother trained me to be. I don’t know how to stop. It’s affecting my health. I have MS, nine breast biopsies in the past few months, irritable bowel syndrome, can’t keep weight on, and arthritis. I work full time, have a side business of four accounting clients, am a Girl Scout troop leader for my daughters, youth athletic coach, make jewelry, and can vegetables. Everybody looks at me for what I do, not realizing there is a <span class="italic"><span>me</span></span> inside of there too. I can’t sit down. It feels like I am leaping small buildings in a single bound and if I sit down, I will crash.”</li><li class="listItem">Bernie looks at her overachieving with some regret. “I never called in sick at work even when I felt awful. Every job I had, I gave 100 percent. In fact, anything I do gets 100 percent. This is all that makes me good enough. Raising my daughters, sometimes I gave too much to my job when I should have been home with them. I have some regrets about this now, as well as a new diagnosis of fibromyalgia.”</li><li class="listItem">Marlo, 45, tells me, “I am an overachiever, a perfectionist type A with my job, with keeping a meticulous house, with constantly having new goals that I want to obtain. I never feel it is good enough and always that I have to do more. I have constant feelings of anxiety, worry, and excessive stress.”</li></ul><p class="para"><span>Once you recognize that you are trying to patch up your vulnerability with various modes of achievement, you will see that you have been shortchanging yourself and those you love. Then you’ll be able to take steps to change.</span></p><p class="chapterHeadA"><span><span class="bold"><span>Internal Versus External Validation</span></span></span></p><p class="paraNoIndent"><span>The need for validation can be a catch-22. If a child did not receive validation in her early developmental years, and as a young woman is not able to validate herself, she often succumbs to the lure of doing more and trying harder in ways that bring validation from others. This is an unconscious seduction because Mary Marvels are almost always highly skilled and competent. It is therefore not difficult to obtain external validation from friends, family, work, or society in general. The praise appears to fill the emptiness, but relying on external praise can create anxiety. Because it is <span class="italic"><span>external</span></span> validation, the daughter does not own it or control it and it can be taken away from her at any time. If she does not continue to accomplish, it will also disappear.</span></p><p class="para"><span>When you learn to rely on yourself for validation, on the other hand, you rest peacefully at night. You will be learning more about how to do this in the recovery section of the book, but let’s look closely now at why you find it so difficult to give yourself credit.</span></p><p class="chapterHeadA"><span><span class="bold"><span>Am I Arrogant?</span></span></span></p><p class="paraNoIndent"><span>Many daughters are afraid to give themselves credit. On the rare occasions when they do, they feel as if they are behaving like a narcissist or at the very least, acting arrogant, like their mothers. If you are worried about emulating your mother in this way, remind yourself that the true narcissist has “a grandiose sense of self-importance, e.g., exaggerates achievements and talents, expects to be recognized as superior without commensurate achievements.”<span class="centerImage"><span><a href="part0028.html#en_des_00005_00002"><sup class="calibre3">3</sup></a></span></span></span></p><p class="para"><span>The narcissist is arrogant in disingenuous ways, and most times with nothing to back up the bragging spree. She needs to make herself look bigger than she really is because she feels inadequate. But most high-achieving, Mary Marvel daughters have a ton of very real achievements because they have worked so hard. It is not narcissistic to be proud of your achievements and accomplishments. You do not need to brag, but give <span class="italic"><span>yourself</span></span> the credit you deserve. By giving yourself credit where credit is due, you can help slow down the rat race of do, do, do. Feel good about what you have already done.</span></p><p class="chapterHeadA"><span><span class="bold"><span>Am I an Impostor?</span></span></span></p><p class="paraNoIndent"><span>Another reason high-achieving Mary Marvels have difficulty giving themselves internal praise is a fear called the “impostor syndrome.” Someone who suffers from the impostor syndrome is unable to accept and claim her accomplishments, no matter what level of success she has achieved or maintained. She may have abundant proof of her hard-won accomplishments, including wealth and material goods, but remains convinced that she either doesn’t deserve her success or that she is just a fraud. She dismisses outward signs of accomplishments as just luck or good timing. An “impostor” usually feels as if she has been deceptive, having made others think she is more intelligent or skilled than she believes herself to be. Most people who admit to feeling like impostors are women, although there is some evidence that many men feel this way too.</span></p><p class="para"><span>High-achieving daughters of narcissistic mothers are at great risk for the impostor syndrome because we were raised to feel we were never good enough. When a woman does not feel worthy internally, she believes that she is undeserving and cannot accept success or recognition.</span></p><ul class="bulletList"><li class="listItem">Lonnie, 46, a very bright, accomplished owner of her own clothing company, puts it this way: “I have a knack for appearing competent when I don’t think I really am. I’m always worried that someone will find out that I’m not really very good at my job. I just know how to put on a good show. This bothers me and I know someday someone will find this out and call me a fake.”</li><li class="listItem">Ellen, 57, a successful real estate agent, does not attribute her success to her own efforts: “Every time I make a big sale, even though I know I worked my butt off, I regard it as luck or just a fluke that the money came my way once again and predict that the next time will be a failure.”</li><li class="listItem">Karena, 38, recalls how she felt right after receiving her Ph.D.: “I actually wrote that damn dissertation, but believe me, I won’t ever let anyone read it. I don’t want anyone to see how dumb it sounds. It is amazing I got that degree. Maybe my field is a particularly easy one or the professors felt they had to pass me after all this time.”</li></ul><p class="para"><span>In the above examples, you see how women discount their real successes. In addition to these tendencies, high-achieving daughters tend to disparage themselves and play down their positive attributes because they fear that someone will find them arrogant. This behavior is a holdover from growing up as the target of Mother’s envy.</span></p><p class="para"><span>An article titled “Introduction of the Impostor Syndrome” details some narcissistic family dynamics.</span></p><div class="chapterEpigraph"><p class="paraNoIndent"><span>Attitudes, beliefs, direct or indirect messages that we received from our parents or from other significant people in our lives early on may have contributed to the development of impostor feelings. Certain family situations and dynamics tend to contribute to impostor feelings: when the success and career aspirations conflict with the family expectations of the gender, race, religion, or age of the person, families who impose unrealistic standards, families who are very critical, and families who are ridden with conflict and anger.<span class="centerImage"><span><a href="part0028.html#en_des_00005_00003"><sup class="calibre3">4</sup></a></span></span></span></p></div><p class="para"><span>High-achieving daughters with the impostor syndrome are at great risk for “generalized anxiety, lack of self-confidence, depression, and frustration related to inability to meet self-imposed standards of achievement,”<span class="centerImage"><span><a href="part0028.html#en_des_00005_00004"><sup class="calibre3">5</sup></a></span></span> and cannot usually stop proving their worth until they work through a recovery program.</span></p><p class="para"><span>Even after extended and repeated experiences of success, the impostor feeling does not appear to lessen. This is the lasting power of internalized messages. Incredibly competent women share the following stories:</span></p><ul class="bulletList"><li class="listItem">Lillian wants to relax and rest on her laurels, but cannot. “I could never measure up as a kid. If I brought home a B, it was always ‘Where’s the A?’ If I cleaned the bathroom, I had to redo it because it wasn’t clean enough. Now as an adult, I am a successful screenwriter and should be able to finally feel some success, but I never give myself credit because I never know when the next shoe will drop. Something could happen that would make my proud self sit in shame once again.”</li><li class="listItem">Cassidy always questions herself: “I went to medical school and did very well. I have found deep passion in helping other people and love my job. People call me ‘Doctor’ and look up to me and ask for my help and advice. Even though I can see I have these important skills now, I wonder if I dare allow myself credit for all this hard work. I am a high achiever and always have been, but Mother always warned me, ‘Don’t get a big head.’”</li><li class="listItem">Lela, 59, makes certain that she takes care of herself, but though “I feel good enough at times, it never lasts long. My self-esteem can get shattered easily. Self-doubt is but a thought away. My husband often says to me, ‘Do you have any idea how awesome you are?’ I am truly astounded that I get awards. Why would they pick me? My résumé is about six pages long, but I can’t even say ‘You go, girl’ to myself.”</li><li class="listItem">Jeanie, 45, reports, “The odds were stacked against me. I had no support at home. I got validation at school. I would enter speech contests, I played sports, I was valedictorian. But inside I cried myself to sleep at night. From age 14 to 20, I was clinically depressed and didn’t know it. School was my outlet. That is where people would say I was smart and okay. I would accept my awards with my head down and hunched over. I covered myself with a lot of clothes in my teens. I had a nice figure, but I wanted to hide from people. No confidence really. I was so modest. I could not strut my stuff or Mother would have emotionally abused me. I still underplay myself to others. No one gave me any guidance. In business, I managed to go from nothing to making it in the corporate world. With no insight in how to do it, I am in public relations and a seasoned professional now. I know I have worked hard, but I always feel like a fraud, an impostor. Putting myself down. It is an exhausting way to live.”</li></ul><p class="para"><span>The narcissistic mothers of these talented, seasoned, even wise and self-aware women hijacked their young accomplishments. But now they continue to do this to themselves. I find comfort and inspiration in this favorite passage by Marianne Williamson, and hope you will too. And I hope you will start the recovery process in part 3.</span></p><div class="chapterEpigraph"><p class="paraNoIndent"><span>Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous? Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won’t feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do. We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It’s not just in some of us; it’s in everyone. And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.<span class="centerImage"><span><a href="part0028.html#en_des_00005_00005"><sup class="calibre3">6</sup></a></span></span></span></p></div><p class="chapterHeadA"><span><span class="bold"><span>Does the Glass Slipper Fit?</span></span></span></p><p class="paraNoIndent"><span>If you find you fit the description of Mary Marvel, know you are not alone. Your path to recovery will become clear in part 3 of this book. Many daughters of narcissistic mothers got the message to do well—but not too well, because they might outshine Mom. I don’t want to give you a mixed message too, so let me say again that your accomplishments are truly a marvel. You have overcome great odds and are an amazing woman and now you need to care for yourself and give yourself the credit you deserve. Then you will be able to enjoy the marvel that you truly are and cherish yourself as you deserve.</span></p></div></div></body></html>
