This opened up his pathway to the world of personal development, specifically to ontology and phenomenology in which he was rigorously trained for a number of years before becoming a senior program director with one of the world’s leading personal development companies. After years of facilitating programs to thousands of people all over the world and later studying and being influenced by the philosophies of Martin Heidegger, Hans Georg Gadamer and Edmund Husserl, Gary is producing his own brand of “urban philosophy”. His lifelong commitment to shifting people’s ability to exert real change in their lives drives him each and every day. He has a no-frills, no bullshit approach that has brought him an ever increasing following, drawn to the simplicity and real-world use of his work. He resides in Florida with his wife and three sons.</p><p class="s3"> </p><p class="s3">CONNECT</p><p class="s3">@garyjohnbishop</p><p class="s3">garyjohnbishop.com </p><p class="s21"> </p></div></body></html>
