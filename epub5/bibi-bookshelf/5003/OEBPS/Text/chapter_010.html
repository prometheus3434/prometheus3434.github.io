<p class="noindent"><span><span class="small">HAWKING’S SUGGESTION THAT</span></span> black holes emit radiation had been greeted at first with scepticism in 1974, but we’ve seen that most physicists soon came to agree it wasn’t nonsense after all. Black holes must radiate as any hot body does if our other ideas about general relativity and quantum mechanics aren’t badly out. No one has found a primordial black hole, but if one were discovered, physicists would be shocked to find it <em class="calibre1">not</em> emitting a shower of gamma rays and X-rays.</p>
<p class="indent">Go back to thinking about the particles that are emitted by a black hole in Hawking radiation. A pair of particles appears at the event horizon. The particle with negative energy falls into the black hole. The fact that its energy is negative means we have energy subtracted from the black hole. What happens to that energy? (Recall that we don’t think energy can simply disappear from the <span id="page197">universe</span>.) It is carried off into space with the positive energy particle (<a href="../Text/chapter_006_split_000.html">see Chapter 6</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The upshot, you’ll remember, is that the black hole loses mass and its event horizon shrinks. For a primordial black hole the whole story may end with the black hole’s disappearing completely, probably with an impressive fireworks display. How can something escape from a black hole if nothing can escape from a black hole? It really was one of the great ‘locked room mysteries’ of all time, solved by ‘S. H.’</p>
<p class="indent">The idea that matter in a black hole didn’t necessarily reach the absolute end of time at a singularity had triggered suspicions about another singularity: the singularity Hawking had decided earlier was at the absolute <em class="calibre1">beginning</em> of time. Quantum theory offered a fresh possibility: maybe the Big Bang singularity is, as Hawking terms it, ‘smeared away’. Maybe the door isn’t slammed in our faces after all.</p>
<p class="indent">Hawking points to a similar problem which quantum theory solved early in our century, a problem related to Rutherford’s model of the atom: ‘There was a problem with the structure of the atom, which was supposed to consist of a number of electrons orbiting around the central nucleus, like the planets around the Sun’ (look back at <a href="../Text/chapter_002.html#ch2fig1">Figure 2.1</a>). ‘The previous classical theory predicted that each electron would radiate light waves because of its motion. The waves would carry away energy and so would cause the electrons to spiral inwards until they collided with the nucleus.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch10ref1" id="rch10ref1">1</a></sup> Something had to be wrong with this picture, because atoms <em class="calibre1">don’t</em> collapse in this manner.</p>
<p class="indent">Quantum mechanics, with the uncertainty principle, came to the rescue. We can’t know simultaneously both a <span id="page198">definite</span> position and a definite momentum for an electron. ‘If an electron were to sit on the nucleus, it would have both a definite position and a definite velocity,’ Hawking points out. ‘Instead, quantum mechanics predicts that the electron does not have a definite position but that the probability of finding it is spread out over some region around the nucleus.’ The electrons don’t spiral inwards and hit the nucleus. Atoms don’t collapse.</p>
<p class="indent">According to Hawking, ‘The prediction of classical theory [that we will find the electrons at the nucleus] is rather similar to the prediction of classical general relativity that there should be a Big Bang singularity of infinite density.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch10ref2" id="rch10ref2">2</a></sup> Knowing that everything is at one point of infinite density at the Big Bang or in a black hole is too precise a measurement to be allowed by the uncertainty principle. To Hawking’s way of thinking this principle should ‘smear out’ the singularities predicted by general relativity, just as it smeared out the positions of electrons. There is no collapse of the atom, and he suspected that there was no singularity at the beginning of the universe or inside a black hole. Space would be very compressed there, but probably not to a point of infinite density.</p>
<p class="indent">The theory of general relativity had predicted that inside a black hole and at the Big Bang the curvature of spacetime becomes infinite. If that doesn’t happen, then Hawking wanted to work out ‘what shape space and time may adopt instead of the point of infinite curvature’.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch10ref3" id="rch10ref3">3</a></sup></p>
<p class="h">When Time is Time and Space is Space</p>
<p class="noindent">If you find the following discussion difficult, don’t hesitate to skim over it. It isn’t necessary to understand every word to appreciate Hawking’s theory, but it’s more interesting if <span id="page199">you</span> can. Of course, the maths Hawking uses to describe it, and that you and I would need in order to understand him completely, is much more complicated than the simple maths you will find here.</p>
<p class="indent">Relativity theory links space and time in four-dimensional spacetime: three dimensions of space and one of time. Take a look at what a spacetime diagram is like. Overleaf is one that I once drew showing my daughter Caitlin on her way from her classroom at school to the room where the children ate their lunch. The vertical line on the left represents the passage of time. The horizontal line at the bottom represents all the space dimensions. Any single point on our spacetime diagram represents a position in space and a moment in time. Let’s see how this works.</p>
<p class="indent">The diagram (<a href="../Text/chapter_010.html#ch10fig1">Figure 10.1</a>) begins with Caitlin at her desk in her classroom, at 12.00 noon. She sits still, moving forward in time but going nowhere in space. On the diagram a little band of ‘Caitlin’ moves forward in time. At 12.05 the bell rings. Caitlin moves towards the lunch room. (Her desk still moves forward in time but goes nowhere in space.) Caitlin moves in both time and space. At 12.07 she pauses to retie her trainer. For one minute she moves forward in time but does not move in space. At 12.08 she’s off again towards the lunch room, walking a little faster than before so that the food won’t all be gone by the time she gets there. At 12.15 she arrives at the lunch room. A physicist would say we have traced Caitlin’s ‘world-line’.</p>
<p class="indent">That spacetime diagram was a very sketchy affair. When physicists draw a spacetime diagram, they often use a common unit for both space and time. They might, for instance, use one yard as the unit of both space and time. (One yard of time is very small, only billionths of a second. It’s the time it takes a photon, which moves at the speed of light, to travel one yard.) In such a spacetime diagram, if something moves four yards in space and four yards in time, its world-line traces a 45-degree angle. That’s the world-line for something moving at the speed of light, a photon, for instance (<a href="../Text/chapter_010.html#ch10fig2">Figure 10.2</a>).</p>
<div class="centered-image1" id="page200"><a id="ch10fig1"/><img alt="image" class="imagefix10" src="../Images/f0200-01.jpg"/></div>
<p class="caption1"><em class="calibre1">Figure 10.1. Caitlin in Spacetime</em></p>
<p class="indent">If something moves three yards in space and four in time, it’s moving at three-fourths the speed of light (<a href="../Text/chapter_010.html#ch10fig3a">Figure 10.3a</a>). If something moves four yards in space and three in time, it’s exceeding the speed of light, which isn’t allowed (<a href="../Text/chapter_010.html#ch10fig3b">Figure 10.3b</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">The next diagram (<a href="../Text/chapter_010.html#ch10fig4">Figure 10.4</a>) shows two events happening simultaneously. They have no way of knowing about each other at the instant they happen because, for them to do so, the in formation would have to have a world-line running at a 90-degree angle from the time-line. Travelling such a world-line would require faster-than-light travel. Nothing can travel faster than light and light can’t manage anything greater than a 45-degree angle on the diagram.</p>

They can’t know about each other at the exact moment they occur, because that would require information from one to the other to travel a world-line running at greater than a 45-degree angle from the time-line. A world-line running at greater than a 45-degree angle requires faster-than-light travel. That’s not allowed in our universe</em>.</p>
<p class="indent" id="page203">Now we’ll talk about the ‘length’ of a world-line. How shall we say what the length of a world-line is – a ‘length’ that takes into account all four dimensions?</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s examine the world-line of something that moves a lot faster than Caitlin. The object in <a href="../Text/chapter_010.html#ch10fig5">Figure 10.5</a> moves four yards in space and five in time: four-fifths the speed of light. Think of the distance it moves in the ‘space’ direction on the diagram as one side of a triangle (side <em class="calibre1">A</em>). Think of the distance it moves in the ‘time’ direction on the diagram as a second side (side <em class="calibre1">B</em>). That makes two sides of a right-angled triangle. The world-line of the moving object is the hypotenuse of that triangle (side <em class="calibre1">C</em>).</p>
<p class="indent">Most of us have learned that the square of the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. The square of 4 (side <em class="calibre1">A</em>) is 16. The square of 5 (side <em class="calibre1">B</em>) is 25. The sum of 16 and 25 is 41. The length of side <em class="calibre1">C</em>, the hypotenuse, would be the square root of 41.</p>
<p class="indent">Never mind trying to find that square root. That is another issue. It would be our next challenge if we were working with our familiar school geometry. However, for spacetime things work differently. The square of the hypotenuse (side <em class="calibre1">C</em>) is not equal to the <em class="calibre1">sum</em> of the squares of the other two sides. It’s equal to the <em class="calibre1">difference between</em> the squares of the two other sides. Our object travels four yards in space (side <em class="calibre1">A</em> of the triangle) and five yards in time (side <em class="calibre1">B</em>). The square of 4 is 16; the square of 5 is 25. The difference between 25 and 16 is 9. The square root of 9 is 3. So we know that the third side of the triangle, side C, the world-line of our travelling object, is three yards in length in spacetime.</p>
<div class="centered-image1" id="page204"><a id="ch10fig5"/><img alt="A right-angled triangle" class="imagefix15" src="../Images/f0204-01.jpg"/></div>
<p class="caption1"><em class="calibre1">Figure 10.5. A right-angled triangle, using the distance travelled in space as side A, the distance travelled in time as side B, and the world-line travelled in spacetime as side C, the hypotenuse</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s say, just for the fun of it, that the object is someone wearing a watch. The watch will show that length (three yards) as ‘time’. In <a href="../Text/chapter_010.html#ch10fig6">Figure 10.6</a> (see p. 206) Lauren remains stationary in space and measures five hours on her watch. Her twin brother Tim, moving at four-fifths the speed of light, meanwhile measures only three hours on his. Tim turns around and returns, again measuring three hours <span id="page205">while</span> Lauren measures five. Tim is slightly younger than Lauren when next they meet. This is one of the remarkable, unbelievable things that Einstein taught us about the universe.</p>
<p class="indent">Now let’s consider spacetime diagrams and world-lines of some smaller objects, elementary particles.</p>
<p class="h">‘Sums-Over-Histories’, or: The Likelihood of Visiting Venus</p>
<p class="noindent">Remember the smeared-out positions of electrons in the model of the atom we talked about earlier. Their positions were ‘smeared out’ because we couldn’t measure simultaneously both the position and the momentum of any one of them very precisely. Richard Feynman had a way of dealing with this problem which we now call ‘sums-over-histories’.</p>
<p class="indent">Imagine that you are considering all the different routes Red Riding Hood might take from home to her grandmother’s cottage – not just the quickest way as the crow flies or the safest route avoiding as much as possible the wolf-infested woods, but every possible route she might take. There are billions and billions of possible routes. You ultimately get a gigantic fuzzy picture of her making the journey by all these routes at once. However, some are certainly more likely than others. If you study the probabilities of her taking the various routes, you conclude that she is very unlikely at any time between home and grandmother to be found on the planet Venus, for instance. But according to Feynman you must not completely rule out her passing through there. The probability for that route is extremely low, but not zero.</p>
<p class="indent">In a similar manner, with sums-over-histories, physicists work out every possible path in spacetime that could have been travelled by a certain particle, all the possible ‘histories’ the particle could have had. It’s possible then to calculate the <em class="calibre1">probability</em> of a particle’s having passed through a particular point, something like calculating how likely Red Riding Hood is to travel by way of the planet Venus. (You don’t want to get the idea, however, that particles <em class="calibre1">choose</em> a path. That would be carrying the analogy too far.)</p>
<div class="centered-image1" id="page206"><a id="ch10fig6"/><img alt="image" class="imagefix16" src="../Images/f0206-01.jpg"/></div>
<p class="caption1"><em class="calibre1">Figure 10.6. The ‘twin paradox</em>’</p>
<p class="indent" id="page207">Hawking decided to put sums-over-histories to another use, to study all the different histories the universe could have and which are more probable than others.</p>
<p class="indent">As we continue, you’ll need to know that even though the theory of relativity taught us to think of three dimensions of space and one of time as four dimensions of spacetime, there are still physical differences between space and time. One of these differences has to do with the way we measure the four-dimensional distance between two points in spacetime: the hypotenuse of the aforementioned triangle.</p>
<p class="indent"><a href="../Text/chapter_010.html#ch10fig7">Figure 10.7a</a> (overleaf) shows two separate events (<em class="calibre1">X</em> and <em class="calibre1">Y</em>) on a spacetime diagram. They are connected by a world-line at more than a 45-degree angle from the time-line. No information can pass between these events without exceeding the speed of light. In a case like this, where the distance between two events is greater in space than it is in time, the square on the hypotenuse (side <em class="calibre1">C</em>) of our triangle is a <em class="calibre1">positive</em> number. In the language of physics the square of the ‘four-dimensional separation’ between events <em class="calibre1">X</em> and <em class="calibre1">Y</em> is positive.</p>
<p class="indent"><a href="../Text/chapter_010.html#ch10fig7">Figure 10.7b</a> also shows two events. The distance between them is greater in time than it is in space. A world-line between these events runs at a less than 45-degree angle from the time-line. Information travelling at less than the speed of light can reach <em class="calibre1">Y</em> from <em class="calibre1">X</em>. When this is true, the square on the hypotenuse (side <em class="calibre1">C</em>) of our triangle is a <em class="calibre1">negative</em> number. Physicists say the square of the four-dimensional separation between <em class="calibre1">X</em> and <em class="calibre1">Y</em> is negative.</p>

<p class="indent">Perhaps you got lost in those last two paragraphs. If you <span id="page209">didn’t</span>, a red light may have flashed on in your brain. The square of a number can’t be negative. That doesn’t happen in our mathematics. If the square of a number were a negative number, what number could possibly be its square root? What is the square root, for instance, of minus 9? In our mathematics the square of any number (negative or positive) is always positive: 3 squared (3<sup class="calibre3">2</sup>) is 9; so is minus 3 squared (−3<sup class="calibre3">2</sup>). We can’t possibly arrive at minus 9. It’s impossible for the square of <em class="calibre1">anything</em> to be a negative number.</p>
<p class="indent">Stephen Hawking and other mathematicians and physicists have a way around this problem: imagine that there are numbers that do produce negative numbers when multiplied by themselves, and see what happens. Say that imaginary one, when multiplied by itself, gives minus one. Imaginary two, multiplied by itself, gives minus four. Calculate the sums-over-histories of the particles and sums-over-histories of the universe using imaginary numbers. Calculate them in ‘imaginary’ rather than ‘real’ time. The time it takes to get from point <em class="calibre1">X</em> to point <em class="calibre1">Y</em> in <a href="../Text/chapter_010.html#ch10fig7">Figure 10.7b</a> is imaginary time – the square root of minus nine – imaginary three.</p>
<p class="indent">Imaginary numbers are a mathematical device (a trick, if you prefer) to help calculate answers that would otherwise be nonsense. ‘Imaginary time’ allows physicists to study gravity on the quantum level in a better way, and it gives them a new way of looking at the early universe.</p>
<p class="h">Smearing Out the Speed of Light?</p>
<p class="noindent">Travelling back into the very early universe, as space becomes more and more compressed, there are fewer possible choices about where a particle is (its position) at a <span id="page210">given</span> moment. The position becomes a more and more precise measurement. Because of the uncertainty principle this causes the measurement of the particle’s momentum to become less and less precise.</p>
<p class="indent">First, let’s look at the photon, the particle of light, under more normal circumstances. Photons move at 186,000 miles (300,000 kilometres) per second, making the speed of light 186,000 miles (300,000 kilometres) per second. Now I have to tell you that this might not always be the case. (Having read this far, you are accustomed to such reversals!) We’ve seen that the probability of finding an electron is spread out over some region around the nucleus of an atom: more likely at some distances than others, but definitely a very smeary affair. Photons, like electrons, can’t simultaneously be pinned down precisely as to both position and momentum, because of the uncertainty principle.</p>
<p class="indent">Just so, Richard Feynman and others have told us that the probability that a photon is travelling at 186,000 miles (300,000 kilometres) per second may be spread out over some ‘region’ around that speed. That’s the same as saying that, in one way of thinking about it, the speed of a photon fluctuates more or less around what we call light speed. Over long distances probabilities cancel out, so as to make the speed of a photon 186,000 miles (300,000 kilometres) per second. However, over very small distances, on the quantum level, there’s a possibility that a photon may move at slightly less or slightly more than this speed. These fluctuations won’t be seen directly, but the path of photons on the spacetime diagram, which we’ve drawn as a 45-degree angle, gets a little fuzzy.</p>
<p class="indent">When we’re studying the very early universe, when <span id="page211">space</span> is very compressed, that line gets <em class="calibre1">very</em> fuzzy. The uncertainty principle means that the more precisely we measure the position of a photon, the less precisely we’re able to measure its momentum. When we say that in the very early universe everything was packed to near-infinite density (not a singularity, but nearly there), we’re becoming extraordinarily precise about the location of particles such as photons. When we are that precise about position, our imprecision about momentum vastly increases. As we near infinite density we also get near an infinite number of possibilities of what the speed of a photon is. What happens to our spacetime diagram now? Look at <a href="../Text/chapter_010.html#ch10fig8">Figure 10.8</a>. The world-line of a photon that in more normal circumstances is shown as a 45-degree angle becomes <em class="calibre1">terribly</em> smeared out. It fluctuates and ripples wildly.</p>
<p class="indent">Here is another way of thinking about what causes this ‘rippling’, a way which will link it more clearly with other concepts in this book. Travelling back into the very early universe is like shrinking ourselves to a size so unimaginably tiny that we can see what’s happening on the level of the extremely small. Imagine it like this: if you look at this page, it seems smooth. You can curl the paper a bit, but it’s still smooth. In the same way, although there is some curvature, spacetime around us seems smooth. On the other hand, if you look at this page under a microscope, you see curves and bumps. Similarly, if you look at space-time on the extremely tiny level, billions on billions of times smaller than an atom, you find violent fluctuations in the geometry of spacetime (<a href="../Text/chapter_010.html#ch10fig9">Figure 10.9</a>) (<a href="../Text/chapter_010.html#page213">see here</a>). We’ll discuss this again in <a href="../Text/chapter_012.html">Chapter 12</a> and learn that it might result in something called ‘wormholes’. For the time being, the point is that we would find the same violent fluctuations in the very early universe, where everything was compressed to just such extreme smallness.</p>

<p class="caption1"><em class="calibre1">Figure 10.8. The uncertainty principle in the early universe</em></p>
<p class="indent">How can we explain this violent, chaotic scene? Again we turn to the uncertainty principle. We saw in <a href="../Text/chapter_006_split_000.html">Chapter 6</a> that the uncertainty principle also means that a field, such as an electromagnetic field or a gravitational field, can’t have a definite value and a definite rate of change over time. Zero would be a definite measurement, so a field can’t measure zero. All fields would <em class="calibre1">have</em> to measure exactly zero in empty space. So, no zero, no empty space. What do we have instead of empty space? A continuous fluctuation in the value of all fields, a wobbling a bit towards the positive and negative sides of zero so as to average out to zero but not <em class="calibre1">be</em> zero. This fluctuation can be thought of as the pairs of particles in Hawking radiation. Particle pair production is greater where the curvature of spacetime is most severe and changing most quickly. That’s why we expect to find so many of them at the event horizon of a black hole.</p>
<div class="centered-image1" id="page213"><a id="ch10fig9"/><img alt="image" class="imagefix20" src="../Images/f0213-01.jpg"/></div>
<p class="caption1"><em class="calibre1">Figure 10.9. The quantum vacuum, as imagined by John Wheeler in 1957, becomes more and more chaotic as you inspect smaller regions of space. At the scale of the atomic nucleus (top), space still looks very smooth. Looking much more closely than that (middle), we see a roughness begin to appear. At a scale 1,000 times smaller still (bottom), the curvature undergoes violent fluctuations</em>.</p>
<p class="indent" id="page214">In the very early universe we find a situation of extremely great spacetime curvature and rapid change in that curvature. The quantum fluctuations in all fields, including the gravitational field, become very violent. If there are violent fluctuations in a gravitational field, that is the same as saying there are violent fluctuations in the curvature of spacetime. We are not talking about big curves, such as swells on the ocean. We are talking about all sorts of continuously changing crinkles and ripples and swirls. Odd things happen to the world-line of a photon in such a wild and weird environment. Again <a href="../Text/chapter_010.html#ch10fig8">see Figures 10.8</a> and <a href="../Text/chapter_010.html#ch10fig9">10.9</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">Whichever of these explanations we prefer, the point is that the difference between the time direction and directions in space disappears. When time looks like space, we no longer have our familiar situation in which the time direction always lies within the 45-degree angle and space directions always lie outside it.</p>
<p class="indent">Hawking sums up what we have just seen: ‘In the very early universe, when space was very compressed, the smearing effect of the uncertainty principle can change the basic distinction between space and time.’ It’s no longer true that if points are farther apart in time than they are in space the square of their separation in four-dimensional spacetime (the square of the hypotenuse of our triangle) is <span id="page215">necessarily</span> a negative number. ‘It is possible for the square of [that] separation to become positive under some circumstances. When this is the case, space and time lose their remaining distinction – we might say that time becomes fully spatialized – and it is then more accurate to talk, not of spacetime, but of a four-dimensional space.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch10ref4" id="rch10ref4">4</a></sup></p>
<p class="h">When Time Gets Spaced Out</p>
<p class="noindent">What would this look like? How is this odd situation of four-dimensional space going to join smoothly with spacetime as we know it, in which time flows as time? Using imaginary time it’s possible to picture four-dimensional space, where time as we know it is non-existent, curving around and forming a closed surface, a surface without any edge or boundary. If you think you can picture this occurring in four dimensions, either you’re mistaken or else you’ve taken a fresh evolutionary step in brain development. Most of us are doomed to think about it in fewer dimensions. It’s easy to picture something with fewer dimensions that hasn’t any edge or boundary: the surface of a ball or the surface of the Earth.</p>
<p class="indent">In the first Friedmann model of the universe, the universe was finite, not infinite, in size. But in that model it was also unbounded. It had no boundaries, no edges in space. It was like the surface of a ball: no edge, but not infinite in size. Hawking thinks the universe may be finite and unbounded in space <em class="calibre1">and time</em>. Time may have no beginning or end. All of it comes around and forms a closed surface, like the surface of the Earth.</p>
<p class="indent">This leaves us fairly helpless. We can picture the surface of the Earth, and we can agree that it is finite and unbounded, but what would a <em class="calibre1">universe</em> that is finite <span id="page216">and</span> unbounded in space and time be like? It’s hard to make a mental connection between the shape of a ball and any meaningful concept of a four-dimensional universe. Just trying makes us feel quite blind – groping in the dark. Let’s see what else we can say about it that might be helpful.</p>
<p class="indent">First, we’ll say what it would <em class="calibre1">not</em> be like. There would be no ‘boundary conditions’ – the way things were at the exact point of beginning – because there would be no point of beginning, no boundary, there. The whole thing would just curve around. Hawking suggests we state it exactly like that: the boundary conditions of the universe are that there are no boundaries. There would be no beginning and no end of the universe – <em class="calibre1">anywhere</em>. So don’t even think of asking, But what about <em class="calibre1">before</em> that? That’s like asking what’s south of the South Pole. A signpost pointing ‘south’ has no meaning at the South Pole. An arrow of time indicating ‘this way to the past’ has no meaning when the time dimension has become ‘spacey’.</p>
<p class="indent">If there were no before and after the universe in the time dimension, would there be any ‘elsewhere’, any other place, any outside of such a universe – in space dimensions? Hawking’s model doesn’t say that there isn’t. Can you have an outside when you don’t have any boundary? In the ball model there is a sense in which we do. It’s in the direction the ant on the surface of the balloon in <a href="../Text/chapter_006_split_000.html">Chapter 6</a> would see if it could look ‘out’ from the surface – which, you’ll remember, it can’t do. That dimension doesn’t exist for the ant, but that doesn’t necessarily mean it doesn’t exist at all. The idea of having ‘elsewheres’ in space but none in time (no before or after) fits nicely with the idea that the time we live in is only a <span id="page217">temporary</span> mutation of what is really a fourth space dimension.</p>
<p class="indent">Since all of this may seem too complicated to be meaningful, let’s look at it in another, more practical, way. Ask again, What would a universe that is finite and unbounded in space and time be like? The calculations are extremely difficult. However, what they appear to be telling us is that a universe like that could be like our own.</p>
<p class="indent-bs">As Hawking described it:</p>
<p class="quote-jy-bs">They predict that the universe must have started out in a fairly smooth and uniform state. It would have undergone a period of what is called exponential or ‘inflationary’ expansion, during which its size would have increased by a very large factor but the density would have remained the same. The universe would then have become very hot and would have expanded to the state that we see it in today, cooling as it expanded. It would be uniform and the same in every direction on very large scales but would contain local irregularities that would develop into stars and galaxies.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch10ref5" id="rch10ref5">5</a></sup></p>
<p class="noindent">In real time – and that’s where we live – it would still appear to us that we have singularities at the beginning of the universe and inside black holes.</p>
<p class="indent">Hawking and Jim Hartle presented the physics community with this no-boundary model of the universe in 1983. Hawking liked to emphasize that it was just a proposal. He hadn’t deduced these boundary conditions from some other principle. The model appealed to him. He thought ‘that it really underlies science because it is really the statement that the laws of science hold everywhere’.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch10ref6" id="rch10ref6">6</a></sup> <span id="page218">There</span> are no singularities at which they break down. This kind of universe is self-contained. Do we have to explain how it was created? Would it have to be created at all? ‘It would just BE,’ writes Hawking.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch10ref7" id="rch10ref7">7</a></sup></p>
<p class="h">‘What Place, Then, for a Creator?’</p>
<p class="noindent">This raises some sticky philosophical questions. As Hawking puts it, ‘If the universe has no boundaries but is self-contained … then God would not have had any freedom to choose how the universe began.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch10ref8" id="rch10ref8">8</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Hawking hasn’t said that the no-boundary proposal rules out the existence of God, only that God wouldn’t have had any choice in how the universe began. Other scientists disagree. They don’t think the no-boundary proposal limits God very much. If God had no choice, we still have to wonder who decided that God would have no choice. Perhaps, suggests the physicist Karel Kuchar, that was the choice God made. Don Page, who reviewed <em class="calibre1">A Brief History of Time</em> for the journal <em class="calibre1">Nature</em> in England, has a similar viewpoint. Page, of course, was Hawking’s graduate assistant in the late 1970s. He had moved on to become a professor at the University of Alberta, Edmondton, Canada. He and Hawking were still good friends and were continuing to collaborate on scientific papers, and Hawking was well aware that Page was likely to come up with some arguments to refute the notion that the no-boundary proposal abolished the need for a Creator. Indeed he did.</p>
<p class="indent">To Hawking’s question, ‘What place, then, for a Creator?’, Page answered that in the Judeo-Christian view ‘God creates and sustains the entire Universe rather than just the beginning. Whether or not the Universe has a <span id="page219">beginning</span> has no relevance to the question of its creation, just as whether an artist’s line has a beginning and an end, or instead forms a circle with no end, has no relevance to the question of its being drawn.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch10ref9" id="rch10ref9">9</a></sup> A God existing outside our universe and our time wouldn’t need a ‘beginning’ in order to create, but it could still look to us, from our vantage point in ‘real’ time, as though there had been a ‘beginning’.</p>
<p class="indent">In <em class="calibre1">A Brief History of Time</em> Hawking himself would suggest that there may still be a role for a Creator: ‘Is the unified theory so compelling that it brings about its own existence?’ If not, ‘What is it that breathes fire into the equations and makes a universe for them to describe?’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch10ref10" id="rch10ref10">10</a></sup> In the book <em class="calibre1">A Brief History of Time: A Reader’s Companion</em>, the companion book for the film, he would say that if the no-boundary proposal is correct, he will have succeeded in discovering how the universe began. ‘But I still don’t know why it began.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch10ref11" id="rch10ref11">11</a></sup> He intended to find out, if he possibly could.</p>
<p class="indent">All of which brings us to a word of caution: although theoretical physicists ask challenging, penetrating questions and present us with mind-blowing proposals and theories, they do not claim to give us ‘ultimate answers’ – even though the subtitle of a later book co-authored by Hawking might suggest that they do. The best science progresses by suggesting ‘answers’ and then taking apart and disproving those ‘answers’. The most daring and imaginative scientists launch their toy boats and then, it seems, try extremely hard to make them sink.</p>
<p class="indent">Hawking’s work is a prime example. First he proved that the universe had to start as a singularity. Then with his no-boundary proposal he showed us how there might be <span id="page220">no</span> singularity after all. In the meantime he told us that black holes could never get smaller, and then he discovered they could. His work on the Big Bang singularity seemed consistent with a biblical view of Creation, but his no-boundary proposal put the Creator out of a job or at least changed the job description. In <em class="calibre1">A Brief History of Time</em> he suggested that we might need the Creator after all, and ‘the ultimate triumph of human reason’ would be to ‘know the mind of God’.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch10ref12" id="rch10ref12">12</a></sup> Hawking is provocative and open-minded in the way that the greatest thinkers have always been. He reaches clearly defined, well-supported conclusions, and then in the next breath he mercilessly questions and breaks down those same conclusions. He doesn’t hesitate to admit that an earlier conclusion was incorrect or incomplete. That’s the way his science – and perhaps all good science – advances, and one of the reasons why physics seems so full of paradoxes.</p>
<p class="indent">In the process, Hawking has supplied eloquent quotations that can be used to support opposing philosophical points of view. He’s been quoted and misquoted by those who believe in God and those who do not. He’s been the hero and villain of both camps. However, those who depend on his statements – or statements of other scientists – to support their belief or unbelief risk having the rug swept out from under them at any moment.</p>
<p class="indent">Meanwhile, although it may appear to us that Hawking completely reversed himself with the no-boundary proposal, he didn’t see it that way. He said that the most important thing about his work on singularities was that it showed that a gravitational field must become so strong that you can’t ignore quantum effects. And when you stop ignoring quantum effects, you find out that the universe <span id="page221">could</span> be finite in imaginary time but have no boundaries or singularities.</p>
<p class="h">Inflation Gets Chaotic</p>
<p class="noindent">In 1983, the same year that Hawking and Jim Hartle published their no-boundary proposal, Andrei Linde solved some of the still nagging problems of inflation theory with a new suggestion. The first person in the West to whom he mentioned ‘chaotic inflation’ was Hawking. Hawking was enthusiastic.</p>
<p class="indent">Both ‘old’ and ‘new’ inflation had assumed that inflation was just an intermediate short phase in the history of the early universe, that the universe was in a state of thermal equilibrium (meaning it was the same temperature everywhere) before inflation started, relatively homogeneous and large enough to survive until the inflation process got underway. Linde abandoned these assumptions in his chaotic inflation scenario, which didn’t require thermal equilibrium, and in which inflation could begin earlier, closer to the Big Bang.</p>
<p class="indent">The universe before the inflationary period could have been in a chaotic state. All that was needed was for minuscule parts of that chaos to be able to inflate, becoming smoother and more isotropic<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#FT1pg221" id="rFT1pg221">fn1</a></sup> as they did so, like balloons that started out as crinkly pieces of rubber and ended up smooth balls. For all we know, only one tiny part of the chaos did that, though that is probably not likely. In any event, our balloon, as it inflated, pushed other inflating bits far out of range of our potential sight. Maybe other parts of the universe are still chaotic. Or maybe everything <span id="page222">is</span> smooth everywhere.</p>
<p class="indent">In chaotic inflation there is no phase transition or supercooling at all. Instead, there is a field that has large values in some regions of the universe, while not in others, a kind of ‘lucky negligence of the Creator’, as Linde puts it.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch10ref13" id="rch10ref13">13</a></sup> The energy in the regions with large values, Linde was thinking, would be great enough to have a repulsive gravitational effect, causing them to expand in an inflationary way, while in the regions of the field where the values were too small this could not happen. Inflation in the regions where it did happen would create enormous homogeneous islands out of the original chaos, each one much larger than our observable universe. In these regions, the energy of the field would decrease slowly and, in some of them, eventually allow the expansion to reach the rate of expansion that we observe. Have a sufficient number of these regions around and we are highly likely to find one where the conditions were such as to produce a universe like the one we know, with the constants of nature that are arbitrary elements in our theories set just right to allow for the eventual existence of you and me. Maybe only one – in which case that one is ours.</p>
<p class="indent">A satisfying resolution to the story, but … not the end of it. Chaotic inflation theory also predicted a ‘second stage of inflation’, occurring much later – a speeding up of the expansion of the universe … perhaps in our own modern era. In the early eighties, that idea sounded like science fiction, even to Andrei Linde and Stephen Hawking. We will see that by the end of the century it would no longer be science fiction.</p>
<p class="indent">Meanwhile, the most remarkable aspect of inflation theory as it was beginning to be thought of in the early <span id="page223">1980s</span> was that though theorists still had different ideas about the way inflation happened, there <em class="calibre1">was</em> agreement that the whole visible universe that we know today could have begun from a much smaller irregularity of mass and energy than anyone had imagined possible. As John Barrow phrased it in <em class="calibre1">The Book of Universes</em>: ‘Instead of eradicating [irregularities], inflation just swept them beyond the visible horizon in the universe today. They will still be there somewhere far away but the whole of our visible universe reflects the high isotropy and smoothness of a tiny patch of space that underwent inflation.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch10ref14" id="rch10ref14">14</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Our universe is not, of course, completely smooth. We have solar systems, galaxies and galaxy clusters. Even immediately following inflation, the bit that would eventually expand to be our visible universe must not have been as perfectly smooth as the imagined inflated balloon might suggest. It would be stretched out, but not so much as to avoid still having small variations that would have provided the seeds that could grow into all that astounding structure – large-scale modern variations in density indeed.</p>
<p class="indent">As early as the conference Hawking and Gibbons organized in Cambridge in the summer of 1982, the participants realized that inflation would have produced a particular pattern of variations.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch10ref15" id="rch10ref15">15</a></sup> This would show up as a recognizable pattern of variation in the cosmic microwave background radiation. Observations at that time were not able to show any such pattern. Nevertheless, in the case for and against inflation, though no one could ever be an eye witness to the events with which our universe began, there was hope that there might someday be some evidence to show whether inflation theorists had it right.</p>
