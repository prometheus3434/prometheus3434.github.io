<p class="chaptitle">‘The big question was, was there a beginning or not?’</p>
<p class="noindent"><span><span class="small">AFTER THEIR WEDDING</span></span> and a short honeymoon in Suffolk, which was all they could afford, Stephen and Jane Hawking set out across the Atlantic to America for a general relativity summer school at Cornell University in upper New York State. The summer school was another opportunity for Hawking to meet top people in his field. However, he remembers the experience as ‘a mistake’. ‘It put quite a strain on our marriage, specially as we stayed in a dormitory that was full of couples with noisy small children.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch5ref1" id="rch5ref1">1</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">One summer evening at Cornell, chatting with friends in the night air – chilly in those climes despite the time of year – Hawking suddenly had a choking fit. He knew he should expect such episodes, but since he had resolutely refused to discuss his problems with Jane, she did not, and <span id="page83">she</span> had no idea what to do to help him. Finally he signalled her to give him a hard thump on the back. This solved the immediate problem, but the experience left Jane shaken and vividly aware of what faced them. ‘The demonic nature of the illness had announced its presence.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch5ref2" id="rch5ref2">2</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">In October, Hawking, aged twenty-three, began his fellowship at Caius. Jane Hawking had another year to go to complete her undergraduate degree at London University. As planned, Hawking would fend for himself during the week. She would join him for the weekends. Since he couldn’t walk far or cycle, they needed Cambridge lodgings near his department. Before going to America they had applied for a flat being built in the market square. No one told them that those flats were actually owned by Hawking’s college, which might have given their application an advantage. As it turned out, that didn’t matter because the flats weren’t ready for occupancy that autumn.</p>
<p class="indent">The bursar at Caius had earlier informed Stephen that Caius policy was not to help Fellows find housing. Relenting only slightly, he offered Stephen and Jane one room in a graduate student hostel and charged them double because there would be two of them living there at weekends. Then, three days after moving into the hostel, they discovered a small house available for three months in Little St Mary’s Lane – one of a group of picturesque cottages that line one side of the lane across from Little St Mary’s Church and churchyard garden. The house was only a hundred yards from the new Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics (DAMTP) premises in Silver Street, where <span id="page84">Stephen</span> was sharing an office with another young physicist, Brandon Carter. He was able to walk that distance, and he acquired a small three-wheeled car to drive when he needed to get to the Institute of Astronomy in the countryside near town. Later that autumn, when their first three-month lease was approaching its end, the Hawkings learned that another house in the lane was unoccupied. A helpful neighbour located the owner in Dorset and upbraided her for having her house vacant while a young couple had no place to live. The owner agreed to rent.</p>
<p class="indent">The choking fits became more frequent. Stephen’s sister Mary, still working towards her medical degree at London University, suggested that warmer, drier weather might help. Partly on that advice, in December at the end of the Michaelmas term, the Hawkings took advantage of an opportunity to cross the ocean for a second time. Stephen attended an astrophysics conference in Miami, and from there they went on to Austin, Texas, to spend a week with one of his graduate school friends George Ellis and his wife. They returned to England in time for Christmas and the move into their second, more permanent home in Little St Mary’s Lane.</p>
<p class="indent">Both Stephen and Jane followed punishing schedules during that first year of their marriage. Hawking was still keenly aware of his lack of mathematical background. Being, as his mother has said, a ‘self-educator’, he decided to use a time-honoured graduate student method of improving one’s own knowledge while also earning some money: if you want or need to learn a subject, teach it. So, in addition to working on his Ph.D. thesis, he supervised undergraduate mathematics for the college.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch5ref3" id="rch5ref3">3</a></sup> Jane managed <span id="page85">her</span> weekly commute, finished her undergraduate degree, engineered the move from one house to another, and typed her husband’s Ph.D. dissertation.</p>
<p class="indent">They celebrated the completion of Stephen’s Ph.D. in March 1966, and there was more to celebrate. Hawking had submitted an essay, ‘Singularities and the Geometry of Space-Time’, in competition for the prestigious Adams Prize, awarded by St John’s College, Cambridge, and named for John Couch Adams, co-discoverer of the planet Neptune. The winner had to be a young researcher who was based in Britain, and the work had to be of international calibre. Hawking’s essay was co-winner with Roger Penrose’s entry. A proud Denis Sciama told Jane that, in his opinion, Stephen could look forward to a career worthy of Isaac Newton.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch5ref4" id="rch5ref4">4</a></sup> In spite of his physical difficulties and bleak prospects, these were halcyon days: Cambridge in the 1960s was an extremely stimulating place for someone with Hawking’s interests. Everything seemed possible. Surprisingly much was!<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch5ref5" id="rch5ref5">5</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">That spring, Jane Hawking, eager to maintain some intellectual identity and purpose of her own, decided to continue her education and work towards a Ph.D. from London University. For her thesis topic she chose a critical treatment of previously published medieval Spanish texts. This topic allowed her to do her research in libraries rather than from primary sources. Even so, deciding to pursue a Ph.D. was a bold step, for Stephen was requiring more and more care and it was also about this time that the Hawkings decided to start a family. In the autumn of 1966, when Jane’s first pregancy began, Stephen’s fingers were beginning to curl and writing by hand became almost impossible for him. In an <span id="page86">extraordinary</span> move, for which Sciama was responsible, the Institute of Physics funded physical therapy at home for him twice a week.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch5ref6" id="rch5ref6">6</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">The Hawkings’ first child, Robert, was born on 28 May 1967. It was four years since doctors had told Stephen Hawking he had two years to live. He was still on his feet, and he was a father. Jane recalls: ‘It obviously gave Stephen a great new impetus, being responsible for this tiny creature.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch5ref7" id="rch5ref7">7</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Robert was still an infant when his parents whisked him off to America, on their first visit to the west coast. Hawking attended a seven-week summer school in Seattle, Washington. After this there was a fortnight at the University of California, Berkeley. He was living up to the reputation for ‘international calibre’ that had helped him win the Adams Prize. They ended the trip with a hop across the continent to spend time with Hawking’s childhood friend John McClenahan (the friend who had bet that Hawking would never amount to anything) and Hawking’s sister Mary, who now was practising medicine in the eastern United States. After nearly four months in America, Stephen, Jane and their baby returned to Cambridge in October in time for the Michaelmas term. Caius College had renewed Stephen’s fellowship for two more years.</p>
<p class="indent">People who remember Stephen Hawking in the DAMTP in the mid- to late 1960s recall his making his way around the corridors with a cane, supporting himself against the wall and speaking with what sounded like a speech impediment. More than that, they remember his brashness in sessions involving some of the world’s most distinguished scientists. The reputation that had begun <span id="page87">when</span> he challenged Fred Hoyle in 1964 was being reinforced regularly. While other young researchers kept a reverent silence, Hawking daringly asked unexpected and penetrating questions and clearly knew what he was talking about. The comments about ‘a genius’, ‘another Einstein’, began then. In spite of Hawking’s ready wit and popularity, that reputation and his physical problems distanced him from some in the department. One acquaintance told me: ‘He was very friendly always, but at the same time, some felt a little shy about asking him out with the gang for a beer at the pub.’ It’s no wonder Hawking feels it’s been a problem preventing people from thinking of him as ‘anything less or more than simply human’.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch5ref8" id="rch5ref8">8</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">In the late 1960s, Hawking’s physical condition began deteriorating again. He had to use crutches. Then it became difficult for him to get about even with crutches. He waged a pitched battle against the loss of his independence. A visitor remembers watching him spend fifteen minutes getting up the stairs to bed on his crutches, determined to do it without help. His determination sometimes seemed to be pigheadedness. Hawking refused to make concessions to his illness, even when those ‘concessions’ were practical steps to make things easier for him and make him less of a burden to others. It was his battle. He would fight it his way. His way was to regard any concession as caving in, an admission of defeat, and to resist as long as possible. ‘Some people would call it determination, some obstinacy,’ says Jane Hawking. ‘I’ve called it both at one time or another. I suppose that’s what’s kept him going.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch5ref9" id="rch5ref9">9</a></sup> John Boslough, who wrote a book about Hawking in the early 1980s, called him ‘the toughest man <span id="page88">I</span> have ever met’.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch5ref10" id="rch5ref10">10</a></sup> Even with a bad cold or flu, Hawking rarely missed a day of work. Meanwhile, while Hawking refused to make concessions to his illness, Jane Hawking learned to make no concessions to him. This was <em class="calibre1">her</em> way of fighting and part of her campaign to keep his life as normal as possible.</p>
<p class="indent">Boslough also described Hawking as a ‘gentle, witty man’, who quickly made you forget about his physical problems. That ‘gentle’ wit cut through all nonsense and pretension. Hawking’s ability to make light of himself, his problems, and even the science he was so keen on was awe-inspiring. It helped others to like him and most of the time eclipsed the feelings of ‘differentness’. For some he became, in the department, the most fun to be around. Hawking seems to have been following, without probably ever having read it, the advice Louisa May Alcott’s mother gave her family in times of overwhelming distress: ‘Hope and keep busy.’</p>
<p class="indent">Hawking’s future was more threatened by his communication problems than by his immobility. His speech was becoming more and more slurred and indistinct, so much so that Caius College and the University had to face the fact that he could not give regular lectures. His research fellowship was about to expire again in 1969. Once more Denis Sciama saved the day, this time with help from Hermann Bondi. A rumour got about – no one knows who started it, and maybe it was true – that King’s College, just down the street, was going to offer Hawking a Senior Research Fellowship. Caius came up with a way to keep him – a six-year contract for a specially created ‘Fellowship for Distinction in Science’. Hawking was becoming an important physicist. He was far too valuable to lose.</p>
<p class="indent" id="page89">Hawking’s science continued to occupy his mind far more than concern about canes and crutches and stairs. His almost obsessive enjoyment of his work set the tone of his life. In the late 1960s he was finding out what the universe is like and how it might have begun – what he describes as playing ‘the game of universe’. In order to understand the work he was immersed in, we have to go back thirty-five years.</p>
<p class="h">The Game of Universe</p>
<p class="noindent">Today we take it for granted that we live in a lacy spiral disc galaxy – the Milky Way – one of many galaxies more or less like it in the universe, with vast stretches of space between them. Early in the twentieth century not everyone accepted this picture. It was the American astronomer Edwin Hubble who, in the 1920s, showed that there are indeed many galaxies besides our own. Is there any pattern to the movement of these galaxies? Hubble showed that there is, with one of the most revolutionary discoveries of the century: the distant galaxies are all moving away from us. The universe is expanding.</p>
<p class="indent">Hubble found that the more distant a galaxy is, the more rapidly it’s moving away from us: twice as far, twice as fast. We observe some extremely distant galaxies receding as fast as two-thirds the speed of light. Does that mean every star in the universe is moving away from us? No. Our near neighbours are milling around, some approaching, some receding. It’s between clusters of galaxies that space is expanding. The most helpful way to think of the expansion of the universe is not as things rushing away from one another but as space between them swelling. It’s an oversimplification, but imagine a loaf of raisin bread rising in the <span id="page90">oven</span>. As the dough swells, the raisins move apart. ‘Twice as far, twice as fast’ works with raisins as well as with galaxies.</p>
<p class="indent">If galaxies are receding from us and from each other, then unless something has changed drastically somewhere along the line, they used to be much closer together. At some moment in the past, wouldn’t they all have been in exactly the same place? All the enormous amount of matter in the universe packed in a single point, infinitely dense?</p>
<p class="indent">That isn’t the only possible history of an expanding universe. Perhaps there was once a universe something like ours, and that universe contracted, with all its galaxies getting closer together, looking as though they were on collision course. But galaxies and stars, and atoms and particles, for that matter, have other motion in addition to the motion that draws them straight towards one another. Planets orbit stars, for instance. The result in that universe might have been that, instead of meeting in a point of infinite density, the galaxies, or the particles that made them up, missed one another, flew past, and the universe expanded again until it looks the way it does today. Could it have happened like that? Which way did it happen? These were questions Hawking had begun to consider in his Ph.D. thesis. ‘The big question was,’ says Hawking, ‘was there a beginning or not?’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch5ref11" id="rch5ref11">11</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">His search for an answer began, as we mentioned in <a href="../Text/chapter_004.html">Chapter 4</a>, with an idea introduced by Roger Penrose in 1965. Penrose’s idea concerned the way some stars may end up – something that three years later was going to be given the spectacular name ‘black hole’ by John Archibald Wheeler. The concept combined what we know about gravity with what general relativity tells us about the <span id="page91">behaviour</span> of light. Hawking’s friend Kip Thorne would later remember 1965–80 as a golden age of black hole research. In the enormous achievements made, Hawking was in the vanguard.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch5ref12" id="rch5ref12">12</a></sup></p>
<p class="h">What Do We Know about Gravity and Light?</p>
<p class="noindent">Gravity is the most familiar of the four forces. We all learned early in life that it’s gravity you blame when your ice cream cone splats on the rug or when you fall off a swing. Asked to guess whether gravity is a very weak or a very strong force, you might answer ‘incredibly strong’. You would be wrong. It’s by far the weakest of the four forces. The gravity that’s so conspicuous in our everyday lives is the gravity of this great hulk of a planet we live on, the combined gravity of every particle in it. The contribution of each individual particle is infinitesimal. It takes sensitive instruments to detect the faint gravitational attraction between small, everyday objects. However, because gravity always attracts, never repels, it has a talent for adding up.</p>
<p class="indent">Physicist John Wheeler liked to think of gravity as a sort of universal democratic system. Every particle has a vote that can affect every other particle in the universe. When particles band together and vote as a bloc (in a star, for instance, or in our Earth), they wield more influence. The very weak gravitational attraction of the individual particles in large bodies like the Earth adds up to a significant force: an influential voting bloc.</p>
<p class="indent">The more matter particles there are making up a body, the more mass that body has. Mass is not the same as size. Mass is a measure of how much matter is in an object, <span id="page92">how</span> many votes are in the voting bloc (regardless of how densely or loosely the matter is packed), and how much the object resists any attempt to change its speed or direction.</p>
<p class="indent">Sir Isaac Newton, Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge in the 1600s, the same position Hawking would hold, discovered laws explaining how gravity works in more or less normal circumstances. According to Newton, bodies are not ‘at rest’ in the universe. They don’t just sit still until some force comes along to push or pull them and then later ‘run down’ and sit still again. Instead, a body left completely undisturbed continues to move in a straight line without changing speed. It’s best to think of everything in the universe as being in motion. We can measure our speed or direction in relation to other objects in the universe, but we can’t measure them in relation to absolute stillness or anything that resembles absolute north, south, east, west, or up or down.</p>
<p class="indent">For example, if our moon were alone in space, it would not sit still but rather move in a straight line without changing its speed. (Of course, if it were truly all alone, there would be no way to tell it was doing this, nothing to which we could relate its motion.) But the moon isn’t all alone. A force known as gravity acts on the moon to change its speed and direction. Where does that force come from? It comes from a nearby voting bloc of particles (a massive object) known as the Earth. The moon resists the change. It tries to keep moving in a straight line. How well it’s able to resist depends on how many votes are in <em class="calibre1">it</em>, how massive it is. Meanwhile, the moon’s gravity also affects the Earth. The most obvious result is the ocean tides.</p>
<p class="indent">Newton’s theory tells us that the amount of mass a body <span id="page93">has</span> affects how strong the pull of gravity is between it and another body. Other factors remaining equal, the greater the mass, the greater the attraction. If the Earth were double its present mass, the attraction of gravity between the Earth and the moon would be double what it currently is. Any change in the mass of either the Earth or the moon would change the strength of the gravitational pull between them. Newton also discovered that the farther apart bodies are, the weaker the pull between them is. If the moon were twice its present distance from the Earth, the pull of gravity between the Earth and the moon would be only one-fourth as strong. Newton’s theory is usually stated: Bodies attract each other with a force that is proportional to their mass and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.</p>
<p class="indent">Newton’s theory of gravity is an extremely successful theory. It wasn’t improved on for over two hundred years. We still use it, though we now know that it fails in some circumstances, such as when gravitational forces become enormously strong (near a black hole, for instance) or when bodies are moving at near light speed.</p>
<p class="indent">Albert Einstein, early in the twentieth century, saw a problem with Newton’s theory. If the strength of gravity between two objects is related to the distance between them, then if someone takes the sun and moves it farther from the Earth, the force of gravity between the Earth and the sun should change instantly. Is this possible?</p>
<p class="indent">Einstein’s theory of special relativity recognized that the speed of light measures the same no matter where you are in the universe or how you’re moving and that nothing can move faster than the speed of light. Light from the sun takes about eight minutes to reach Earth. We always see <span id="page94">the</span> sun as it was eight minutes ago. So, move the sun farther from the Earth; the Earth won’t find out this has happened and feel any effect of the change for eight minutes. For eight minutes we’ll continue to orbit just as though the sun hadn’t moved. In other words, the effect of the gravity of one body on the other cannot change instantaneously because gravity can’t move faster than the speed of light. Information about how far away the sun is cannot move instantaneously across space. It can move no faster than about 186,000 miles (300,000 kilometres) per second.</p>
<p class="indent">It’s obvious then that when we talk about things moving in the universe, it’s not realistic to talk in terms of only the three dimensions of space. If no information can travel faster than the speed of light, things out there at astronomical distances simply don’t exist for us or for each other without a time factor. Describing the universe in three dimensions is as inadequate as describing a cube in two. Instead we must recognize the time dimension, admit there are really four dimensions, and talk of spacetime.</p>
<p class="indent">Einstein spent several years developing a theory of gravity that would work with what he’d discovered about light and motion at near light speed. In 1915 he introduced his theory of general relativity, requiring us to think of gravity not as a force acting between bodies but in terms of the shape, the curvature, of four-dimensional spacetime itself. In general relativity gravity is the geometry of the universe.</p>
<p class="indent-bs">Bryce DeWitt, at the University of Texas, suggested we begin thinking about this curvature by imagining someone who believes the Earth is flat trying to draw a grid on the Earth:</p>
<p class="quote-jy-bs" id="page95">The result can be seen from an airplane on any clear day over the cultivated regions of the Great Plains. The land is subdivided by east–west and north–south roads into square-mile sections. The east–west roads often extend in unbroken lines for many miles, but not the north–south roads. Following a road northward, there are abrupt jogs to the east or west every few miles. The jogs are forced by the curvature of the Earth. If the jogs were eliminated, the roads would crowd together, creating sections of less than a square mile. In the three-dimensional case one can imagine building a giant scaffold in space out of straight rods of equal length joined at angles of precisely 90 degrees and 180 degrees. If space is flat, the construction of the scaffold would proceed without difficulty. If space is curved, one would eventually have to begin shortening the rods or stretching them to make them fit.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch5ref13" id="rch5ref13">13</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">According to Einstein the curvature is caused by the presence of mass or energy. Every massive body contributes to the curvature of spacetime. Things going ‘straight ahead’ in the universe are forced to follow curved paths. Imagine a trampoline (<a href="../Text/chapter_005.html#ch5fig1">Figure 5.1</a>). In its centre lies a bowling ball, which causes a depression in the rubber sheet. Try to roll a golf ball in a straight line past the bowling ball. The golf ball will certainly change direction slightly when it meets the depression caused by the bowling ball. It will probably do more than that: it may even describe an ellipse and roll back in your direction. Something like that happens as the moon tries to continue in a straight line past the Earth. The Earth warps spacetime as the bowling ball warps the rubber sheet. The moon’s orbit is the nearest thing to a straight line in warped spacetime.</p>
<div class="centered-image1" id="page96"><a id="ch5fig1"/><img alt="A bowling ball" class="imagefix3" src="../Images/f0096-01.jpg"/></div>
<p class="caption1"><em class="calibre1">Figure 5.1. A bowling ball bends a rubber sheet where it lies. If you try to roll a smaller ball past the bowling ball, the path of the smaller ball will be bent when it encounters the depression caused by the bowling ball. In a similar manner, mass bends spacetime. Paths of objects in spacetime are bent when they encounter the curvature caused by a more massive object</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">Einstein was describing the same phenomenon that Newton described. To Einstein a massive object warps spacetime. To Newton a massive object sends out a force. The result, in each case, is a change in the direction of a second object. According to the theory of general relativity, ‘gravitational field’ and ‘curvature’ are the same thing.</p>
<p class="indent">If you calculate planetary orbits in our solar system using Newton’s theories and then calculate them again using Einstein’s, you get almost precisely the same orbits, except in the case of Mercury. Because Mercury is the nearest planet to the sun, it’s affected more than the others by the sun’s gravity. Einstein’s theory predicts a result of this nearness which is slightly different from the result predicted by Newton’s theory. Observation shows that Mercury’s orbit fits Einstein’s prediction better than Newton’s.</p>
<p class="indent">Einstein’s theory predicts that other things besides moons and planets are affected by the warp of spacetime. Photons (particles of light) have to travel a warped path. If a beam of light is travelling from a distant star and its path takes it close to our sun, the warping of spacetime near the sun causes the path to bend inwards towards the sun a bit, just as the path of the golf ball bends inwards towards the bowling ball in our model. Perhaps the path of light bends in such a way that the light finally hits the Earth. Our sun is too bright for us to see such starlight except during an eclipse of the sun. If we see it then and don’t realize the sun is bending the path of the star’s light, we’re going to get the wrong idea about which direction the beam of light is coming from and where that star actually is in the sky (<a href="../Text/chapter_005.html#ch5fig2">Figure 5.2</a>). Astronomers make use of this effect. They measure the mass of objects in space by measuring how much they bend the paths of light from distant stars. The greater the mass of the ‘bender’, the greater the bending.</p>
<div class="centered-image1" id="page97"><a id="ch5fig2"/><img alt="image" class="imagefix4" src="../Images/f0097-01.jpg"/></div>
<p class="caption1"><em class="calibre1">Figure 5.2. Because mass causes curvature of spacetime, the path of light travelling from a distant star bends as it passes a massive body like the sun. Notice the difference between the position of the star as we see it from the Earth and its true position</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">We’ve been talking about gravity in terms of what we observe on the large scale. That, of course, is the scale on <span id="page98">which</span> gravity becomes conspicuous – in stars, galaxies, even the entire universe – and that is the scale Hawking was dealing with in the late sixties. However, recall from <a href="../Text/chapter_002.html">Chapter 2</a> that gravity can also be looked at in terms of the very small, the quantum level. In fact, unless we can study it there, we will never get it unified with the other three forces, two of which work exclusively on that level. The quantum-mechanical way of looking at the gravitational attraction between the Earth and the moon is to picture it as an exchange of gravitons (the bosons, or messenger particles, of the gravitational force) between the particles that make up those two bodies.</p>
<p class="indent">With that background, we’ll treat ourselves to a little science fiction.</p>
<p class="h">A Disastrous Day for Earth</p>
<p class="noindent">Remind yourself what the force of gravity feels like on Earth (<a href="../Text/chapter_005.html#ch5fig3">Figure 5.3a</a>), then pretend you go off on a vacation in space. While you’re away something drastic happens to the Earth: it gets squeezed to only half its original size. It still has the same mass, but that mass is pressed together much more tightly. Returning from your vacation, your spacecraft hovers for a while at the place in space where the Earth’s surface used to be before the squeezing. You feel as heavy there as you did before you went away. The pull of the Earth’s gravity there hasn’t changed, because neither your mass nor that of the Earth has changed, and you are still the same distance as before from the Earth’s centre of gravity. (Remember Newton!) The moon, out beyond you, still orbits as before. However, when you land on the new surface (a much smaller radius, quite a bit nearer the Earth’s centre of gravity), the gravity on that <span id="page99">new</span> surface is four times what you remember on the Earth’s surface before the squeezing. You feel much heavier (<a href="../Text/chapter_005.html#ch5fig3">5.3b</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">What if something far more dramatic happened? What if the Earth were squeezed to the size of a pea – all the mass of the Earth, billions of tons, squeezed into that tiny space? Gravity on its surface would be so strong that escape velocity would be greater than the speed of light. Even light couldn’t escape. The Earth would be a black hole. However, at the radius out in space where the surface of the Earth was before any squeezing, the pull of the Earth’s gravity would still feel just the same as it does to us today (<a href="../Text/chapter_005.html#ch5fig3">Figure 5.3c</a>). The moon would still be orbiting just as before.</p>
<p class="indent">As far as we know, that story can’t happen. Planets don’t become black holes. However, there’s a good chance some stars do. Let’s retell the story, this time with a star.</p>
<p class="indent">Begin with a star that has a mass about ten times that of the sun. The star’s radius is about 3 million kilometres, about five times that of the sun. Escape velocity is about 1,000 kilometres per second. Such a star has a life span of about a hundred million years, during which a life-and-death struggle goes on within it.</p>
<p class="indent">On one side of the contest is gravity: the attraction of every particle in the star for every other. It was gravity that pulled particles in a gas together to form the star in the first place. The pull is even more powerful now that the particles are closer together. Gravity tries to make the star collapse.</p>
<p class="indent">The pressure of the gas in the star opposes gravity. This pressure comes from heat released when hydrogen nuclei in the star collide and merge to form helium nuclei. The heat makes the star shine and creates enough pressure to resist gravity and prevent the star from collapsing.</p>

<p class="indent">For a hundred million years the contest continues. Then the star runs out of fuel: no more hydrogen to convert into helium. Some stars then convert helium into heavier elements, but that gives them only a short reprieve. When there’s no more pressure to counteract gravity, the star shrinks. As it does, the gravity on its surface becomes stronger and stronger, in the same way that gravity on the Earth’s surface did in the shrinking Earth story. It won’t have to shrink to the size of a pea to become a black hole. When the 10-solar-mass star’s radius is about 20 miles (30 kilometres), escape velocity on its surface will have increased to 186,000 miles (300,000 kilometres) per second, the speed of light. When light can no longer escape, the star becomes a black hole (<a href="../Text/chapter_005.html#ch5fig4">Figure 5.4</a>).<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#FT1pg102" id="rFT1pg102">fn1</a></sup></p>

<p class="caption1"><em class="calibre1">Figure 5.5. In (a), particles from space move towards a star. The paths of particles 1, 2 and 3 are bent as they pass the star. The closer to the star, the greater the bending. Particles 4 and 5 hit the surface of the star. In (b), we see the same particles moving towards the star after it has become a black hole. The paths of particles 1, 2 and 3 are bent exactly as before, because the spacetime outside a star is the same as the spacetime outside a black hole of the same mass. (Recall the shrinking Earth.) Particle 4 circles the black hole and then escapes. It might circle it many times. Particle 5 is captured by the black hole</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">After the escape velocity on its surface is greater than the speed of light, we don’t have to ask whether the star <span id="page103">goes</span> on shrinking. Even if it doesn’t, we still have a black hole. Remember how gravity at the original radius never changed in the Earth-shrinking story. Whether our star goes on shrinking to a point of infinite density or stops shrinking just within the radius where escape velocity reaches the speed of light, gravity at that radius is going to feel the same, as long as the star’s mass doesn’t change. Escape velocity at that radius is the speed of light and will stay the speed of light. Light coming from the star will find escape impossible. Nearby beams of light from distant stars won’t only be bent; they may curl around the black hole several times before escaping or falling in (<a href="../Text/chapter_005.html#ch5fig5">Figure 5.5</a>). If the light enters the black hole, it cannot escape. Nothing can achieve a greater velocity than the speed of light. What a profound ‘blackout’ we have! No light, no reflection, no radiation of any kind (radio, microwave, X-ray and so on), no sound, no sight, no space probe, absolutely no information can escape. A black hole indeed!</p>
<p class="indent">The radius where escape velocity is the speed of light becomes the border of the black hole, the radius-of-no-return: the ‘event horizon’. Hawking and Penrose, in the late 1960s, suggested defining a black hole as an area of the universe, or a ‘set of events’, from which it’s impossible for anything to escape to a distance. That has become the accepted definition. A black hole, with its event horizon for an outer boundary, is shaped like a sphere, or, if it’s rotating, a bulged-out sphere that looks elliptical when seen from the side (or would, if you could see it). The event horizon is marked by the paths in spacetime of rays of light that hover just on the edge of that spherical area, not being pulled in but unable to escape. Gravity at that <span id="page104">radius</span> is strong enough to stop their escape but not strong enough to pull them back. Will you see them as a great orb shimmering in space? No. If the photons can’t escape from that radius, they can’t reach your eyes. In order for you to see something, photons from it have to reach your eyes.</p>
<p class="indent">Classical black hole theory tells us that there are only three secrets a black hole divulges: its mass, its electric charge (if it has any), and its angular momentum or speed of rotation (if it is rotating). John Wheeler, who liked to draw helpful pictures on the chalk-board for his students, drew a television set, a flower, a chair, ‘known particles’, gravitational and electromagnetic waves, angular momentum, mass and even ‘particles as yet undetected’ falling into a black hole, shown as a funnel, and nothing coming out at the bottom of the funnel except mass, electric charge and angular momentum. Part of Hawking’s work in the early 1970s<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch5ref14" id="rch5ref14">14</a></sup> would help to show that, as Wheeler summed it up: ‘Black holes have no hair.’</p>
<p class="indent">It’s the mass of the black hole that determines its size. If you want to calculate the radius of a black hole (the radius at which the event horizon forms), take the solar mass of the black hole (the same as for the star that collapsed to form it unless that star lost mass earlier in the collapse) and multiply by 2 for miles or 3 for kilometres. You’ll find that a 10-solar-mass black hole (that is, a black hole whose mass is ten times the mass of our sun) has its event horizon at a radius of 20 miles (30 kilometres). It’s clear that if the mass changes, the radius where the event horizon is also changes. The black hole changes in size. We’ll talk more about this possibility later.</p>
<p class="indent">Having drawn the curtain at the event horizon, the star <span id="page105">has</span> complete privacy, while any light it emits (any picture of itself that otherwise would be viewed from elsewhere in the universe) is pulled back in. Penrose had wanted to know whether the star would go on collapsing – or just what would happen to it. He had discovered that a star collapsing as we’ve described has all its matter trapped inside its own surface by the force of its own gravity. Even if the collapse isn’t perfectly spherical and smooth, the star does go on collapsing. The surface eventually shrinks to zero size, with all the matter still trapped inside. Our enormous 10-solar-mass star is then confined not just in a region with a 20-mile (30-kilometre) radius (where its event horizon is), but rather in a region of <em class="calibre1">zero</em> radius – zero volume. Mathematicians and physicists call that a singularity. At such a singularity the density of matter is infinite. Spacetime curvature is infinite, and beams of light aren’t just curled around: they’re wound up infinitely tightly.</p>
<p class="indent">General relativity predicts the existence of singularities, but in the early 1960s few took this prediction seriously. Physicists thought that a star of great enough mass undergoing gravitational collapse <em class="calibre1">might</em> form a singularity. Penrose had shown that if the universe obeys general relativity, it <em class="calibre1">must</em>.</p>
<p class="footnote-ts"><a href="#rFT1pg102" id="FT1pg102">fn1</a> Stars less massive than about 8 solar masses probably don’t shrink all the way to become black holes. Only more massive stars become black holes.</p>
