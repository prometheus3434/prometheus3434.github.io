<p class="chaptitle">‘My name is Stephen Hawking: physicist, cosmologist and something of a dreamer’</p>
<p class="noindent"><span><span class="small">HAWKING’S BOOK <em class="calibre1">THE</em></span></span> <em class="calibre1">grand design</em>, written with Leonard Mlodinow, appeared in the early autumn of 2010 with a subtitle that sounded rather un-Hawkinglike. <em class="calibre1">New Answers to the Ultimate Questions of Life</em>. Nothing here of the wry humour of previous titles – a ‘brief’ history – the universe in a ‘nutshell’. Apparently this book was going to get serious.</p>
<p class="indent"><em class="calibre1">The Grand Design</em> pulled together the thinking and work Hawking has been doing for over half a century, to give us a thorough update on the state of the quest for a Theory of Everything. Here are Feynman’s sums-over-histories, the anthropic principle, the meaning of ‘models’ and ‘reality’, the no-boundary proposal, information loss, the disparagement of modern philosophy (this time on the first page rather than the last), the battle with God. But right from the beginning of the book one dramatic change <span id="page412">is</span> clear: the quest for a Theory of Everything has, indeed, fragmented.</p>
<p class="indent">Isaac Asimov once wrote that ‘of all the stereotypes that have plagued men and women of science, surely one above all has wrought harm. Scientists can be pictured as “evil”, “mad”, “cold”, “self-centred”, “absent-minded”, even “square” and yet survive easily. Unfortunately they are usually pictured as “right” and that can distort the picture of science past redemption’. Stephen Hawking’s startling about-faces, which you have witnessed throughout this book, shatter that stereotype. Hawking has a robustly healthy history of pulling the rug out from under his own assertions. But, as we’ve seen, what appear to be about-faces have hardly ever actually been steps backwards or reversals. In Hawking’s own version of the game Snakes and Ladders, snakes don’t take him further from his goal. They just lead him off on more promising pathways. Be that as it may, giving up hope of discovering a fundamental Theory of Everything is an enormous shift – one that Hawking would not have made unless faced with truly unyielding evidence that it was warranted, the only way forward.</p>
<p class="indent">Another thing that is clear from the start of <em class="calibre1">The Grand Design</em> is that Hawking no longer regards string theory with the suspicion he once did. It’s not easy to pin down precisely when he changed his mind on this issue. Most accounts, not his own, have him still rather <em class="calibre1">anti</em>-strings well into the 1990s. However, he told me in 1990 (<a href="../Text/chapter_013.html">Chapter 13</a>) that he thought superstring theory had become the most promising route towards a Theory of Everything. He was right, but … with a twist.</p>
<p class="indent">The newest candidate, and perhaps the final claimant <span id="page413">for</span> that title of ‘ultimate theory of the universe’, is M-theory. As a theory of everything, in the time-honoured description, it is a little disappointing. M-theory is not simple. You can’t print it on a T-shirt. It doesn’t fulfil the promise of Wheeler’s poem. It doesn’t measure up to the Pythagorean standard, where beautiful clarity is a guide to truth. Does that mean it might be wrong? Hawking’s attitude towards it is not that it is right, or ultimate, but that it is the best we are ever going to do.</p>
<p class="indent">M-theory is not a single theory. It is a collection of theories. Hawking describes them as a ‘family of theories’. Each member of the family is a good description of observations in some range of physical situations, but none is a good description of observations in <em class="calibre1">all</em> physical situations. None can account for ‘everything’. The theories may look very different from one another, but all are on an equal footing, and all can be thought of as aspects of the same underlying theory.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch20ref1" id="rch20ref1">1</a></sup> We don’t yet know how to formulate that deeper theory as a single set of equations and arguably never will.</p>
<p class="indent">Hawking and Mlodinow compare the situation to a flat map of the Earth. Because the Mercator projection used for such maps makes areas further north and south look larger than they really are in relation to other parts of the world (the distortion becomes more and more pronounced the further north or south on the map you go), and the North and South Poles are not shown at all, the entire Earth ends up much less accurately mapped than it would if we used, instead, a collection of maps, each one covering a limited region, overlapping. Where the maps overlap, they don’t conflict; that bit of the landscape looks the same regardless of which of the overlapping maps <span id="page414">you’re</span> consulting. Each map is reliable and useful for the area it represents. But no single flat map is a good representation of the Earth’s surface. Just so, no single theory is a good representation of all observations.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch20ref2" id="rch20ref2">2</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Today, theorists recognize five different string theories and supergravity, a version of which Hawking had high hopes for in 1980, as the family of approximations of the more fundamental theory, M-theory. The six approximations are like the smaller maps in Hawking’s map analogy.</p>
<p class="indent">While this situation may not meet our most idealistic expectations for a complete understanding of the universe, we needn’t sit around too long moaning about our ignorance of the fundamental, comprehensive, underlying theory. There are things we do know about it. There are ten or eleven dimensions of time and space. There are point particles, vibrating strings, two-dimensional membranes, three-dimensional objects, and other objects occupying up to nine (or, in some versions, ten) dimensions of space – in other words, p-branes.</p>
<p class="indent">We have already talked about the idea that extra space dimensions beyond the three we experience may be escaping our notice because they are curled up tightly, and that the astounding number of different ways they can curl was at first discouraging to those who were hoping that string theory was going to be the unique theory of everything. Earlier we used the analogy involving a garden hose to help understand the curling up. Hawking and Mlodinow have found a better analogy for it.</p>
<p class="indent">They ask us to imagine a two-dimensional plane. It could be, for instance, a piece of paper. It is two-dimensional because two numbers (horizontal and vertical coordinates) are needed to locate any point on it. It may <span id="page415">not</span> occur to you that a drinking straw is also two-dimensional. To designate a point on it, you need to show where the point is along its length and also where in its circular dimension. But suppose your straw is very, very thin. You’d hardly feel the need to think about where the point is in its circular dimension. If it were extraordinarily thin, a million-million-million-million-millionth of an inch in diameter, Hawking suggests, you wouldn’t think it had a circular dimension at all. That is the way string theorists encourage us to think about the extra dimensions – curled or curved on a scale so small that we don’t notice them. They speak of them as being curled up into ‘internal space’.</p>
<p class="indent">In the early to mid-1990s, theorists were becoming less and less discouraged by the astoundingly many ways dimensions can curl. One change was a new understanding that the different ways of curling up the extra dimensions are nothing but different ways of looking at them from our vantage point in four dimensions. However, as Andrei Linde suggested, the way the extra space dimensions are curled up is crucial. In each universe, it determines the universe’s apparent laws of nature. However many solutions there are in M-theory for the ways internal space can be curled, that is how many different types of universe are allowed, all with different laws. The number is too large to comprehend.</p>
<p class="indent">Hawking suggests we think of the emergence of these universes by imagining something like Eddington’s balloon analogy, the balloon with the ant crawling on it, only this time it isn’t a balloon and the ant is missing. In his 2006 lecture at Caltech, he advised his audience to picture the expanding universe as the surface of a bubble. <span id="page416">Imagine</span>, then, the formation of bubbles of steam in boiling water. Many tiny bubbles form and disappear. These are universes that expand only a little and collapse before they get beyond microscopic size. No hope of galaxies, stars, or intelligent life in them. Some, however, start out just as tiny but grow large enough so that they are out of danger of collapsing, at least for a long, long while. These expand at first at an ever-increasing rate, undergoing what we have come to call ‘inflation’.</p>
<p class="indent"><em class="calibre1">The Grand Design</em> revisits Richard Feynman’s idea that a particle travelling from one point to another in quantum physics has no definite position while it is getting to its destination. That has been taken to mean that it takes no path. As we’ve seen, Feynman realized that it could just as easily be said to take every possible path simultaneously. In this light, consider the possibility of a great many universes, the sort of situation we have in eternal inflation. It doesn’t suffice only to say that each universe has a different history. In fact, thinking of sums-over-histories, each universe has <em class="calibre1">many</em> possible histories and also many possible states later in its existence. Most of those states are totally unsuitable for the existence of life of any sort. There are only a minuscule few of the universes that would allow creatures like us to exist.</p>
<p class="indent">Among all the possible alternative universes, only one is completely uniform and regular. Calculating the probability of this sort of universe, we find that it is very likely indeed. In fact, it is the most probable universe of all, but it isn’t our universe. A universe like that, without small irregularities in the early universe that show up now as small variations in the CMBR, could never be a home for us. Ours has to be a universe with some regions slightly <span id="page417">more</span> dense than others, so that gravitational attraction can draw matter together to form galaxies, stars, planets and, maybe, us. As Hawking had put it in his 2006 Caltech lecture, ‘The [CMBR] map of the microwave sky is the blueprint for all the structure in the universe. We are the product of the fluctuations in the early universe.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch20ref3" id="rch20ref3">3</a></sup> Luckily there <em class="calibre1">are</em> many universe histories that are only slightly un-uniform and irregular. These are almost as probable as the one that is completely uniform and regular. We don’t know how many alternative universes end up producing something like ‘us’, but we do know it did happen once.</p>
<p class="indent">Another familiar concept that is significant in Hawking’s thinking about M-theory is the fact that on the quantum level of the universe we cannot observe without interfering, without changing the very thing we are trying to observe. More important and less familiar to most of us, no matter how carefully and completely we observe the present, the part of the past that we cannot observe is, like the future, indefinite. It exists as a range of possibilities, some more probable than others. Putting that together with Feynman’s sums-over-histories, Hawking concludes that ‘the universe doesn’t have just a single history, but every possible history, each with its own probability; and our observations of its current state affect its past and determine the different histories of the universe’.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch20ref4" id="rch20ref4">4</a></sup> That should not sound entirely unfamiliar. We saw earlier how Hawking and Hartle used sums-over-histories when they were developing their no-boundary proposal. What has occurred in Hawking’s thinking is a change of emphasis, the realization that the ability of our observations of the present to decide among those histories has enormously significant implications for our understanding of the universe.</p>
<p class="indent" id="page418">Go back to thinking about Feynman’s method of considering all the possible paths a particle might follow from its starting point to its end point. It’s not so easy to do with the history of a universe. We don’t know point A (the beginning), but we do, in the case of our own universe, know quite a lot about point B, where we are today. Hawking asks us to consider all the histories that satisfy the no-boundary condition (histories that are closed surfaces without boundaries – recall the globe of the Earth) and that end with the universe we know today (point B). There is a vast range of point As, though we can’t say they include universe histories starting off in ‘every possible way’ because we are limiting them to those that satisfy the no-boundary condition. If we were to start our thinking at point A, we’d end up with many possible point Bs, some of which are similar to our universe today, but most of which are not.</p>
<p class="indent">Hawking is recommending, instead, what he calls his ‘top-down’ approach to cosmology, tracing the alternative histories from the top down, backwards from the present time. It is a new view of cosmology, and, for that matter, a new view of cause and effect. The universe doesn’t have a unique observer-independent history. We create the history of our universe by being here and observing it. History doesn’t create us.</p>
<p class="indent">Take, for example, the question of why there are only four un-curled-up dimensions in our universe. In M-theory there is no overall rule that a universe must have four observable dimensions. Top-down cosmology says that there will be a range of possibilities that includes every number of large space dimensions from zero to ten. Three dimensions of space and one of time may not be the <span id="page419">most</span> probable situation, but that is the only sort of situation that is of interest to us.</p>
<p class="indent">Considering the universe in the old way, from the ‘bottom up’, there seems to be no discoverable reason why the laws of nature are what they are and not something different, why the universe is fine-tuned for our existence. But we do observe the laws of nature to be what they are, and we are here. Why not start with that? Our presence is hugely significant. Out of the enormous array of possible universes, our presence ‘selects’ those universes that are compatible with our existence, and makes all the rest of them <em class="calibre1">almost</em> irrelevant (though we shall see about that as Hawking continues).</p>
<p class="indent">With the no-boundary universe we no longer needed to ask how the universe began. There was no beginning. With M-theory we no longer need to ask why the universe is fine-tuned for our existence. It is our existence that ‘chooses’ the universe we live in. In effect, we fine-tune it ourselves. The anthropic principle has come to its full strength indeed. As Hawking puts it, ‘Although we are puny and insignificant on the scale of the cosmos, this makes us in a sense the lords of creation.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch20ref5" id="rch20ref5">5</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Now, the question arises: can we test this theory? Hawking writes that there may be measurements capable of differentiating the top-down theory from others, to support it or refute it. Perhaps future satellites can take such measurements. In his 2006 Caltech lecture, Hawking had mentioned the ‘new window on the very early universe’ that the detection and measurement of gravitational waves would open for us. Unlike light, which was scattered many times by free electrons before freezing out when the universe was 380,000 years old, gravitational <span id="page420">waves</span> reach us from the earliest universe without interference from any intervening material.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch20ref6" id="rch20ref6">6</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Hawking extends top-down thinking to the emergence of intelligent life on Earth. He offers an eloquent account of the manner in which our universe, our solar system, and our world are incredibly fine-tuned to allow our existence, far far beyond any reasonable expectation. Nevertheless, in a restatement of the anthropic principle in a simple and unarguable way, he tells us that ‘Obviously, when the beings on a planet that supports life examine the world around them, they are bound to find that their environment satisfies the conditions they require to exist.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch20ref7" id="rch20ref7">7</a></sup> Just as we, by the fact of our presence, choose our universe, we choose a history of this Earth and our cosmic environment that allows us to exist.</p>
<p class="indent">In <em class="calibre1">The Grand Design</em>, Hawking seems no longer to entertain doubts that everything is determined. The information paradox, by whatever means it was banished, has ceased to be a bother. He states, unequivocally, that ‘The scientific determinism that Laplace formulated is … in fact, the basis of all modern science.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch20ref8" id="rch20ref8">8</a></sup> <em class="calibre1">That</em>, of course, he had never called into question. His earlier suggestion, regarding the implications of information loss, was that all of modern science might be wrong. Such fears apparently have been put to rest, for he goes on to say that scientific determinism is ‘a principle that is important throughout this book’.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch20ref9" id="rch20ref9">9</a></sup> And, later, ‘This book is rooted in the concept of scientific determinism.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch20ref10" id="rch20ref10">10</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Scientific determinism applies to us humans too: ‘It seems,’ he writes, ‘that we are no more than biological machines and that free will is just an illusion … Since we cannot solve the equations that determine our behaviour, <span id="page421">we</span> use the effective theory that people have free will.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch20ref11" id="rch20ref11">11</a></sup> We might wish Hawking had spent a little more time in the book with this issue. Important scientific work has taken place having to do with human free will – some of it supporting his view and some of it not – but Hawking does not discuss it. He has made his own choice. His comment that the world is in a mess because, ‘as we all know, decisions are often not rational or are based on a defective analysis of the consequences of the choice’, also leaves one wishing for more discussion. The comment comes across as uncharacteristically ‘throw-away’, compared with Hawking’s thoughtful comments about the world situation in his lectures and public statements.</p>
<p class="indent">Determinism turns out, however, to be a somewhat complicated concept and not as rigid as we might suppose. As we saw earlier in this book, on the quantum level of the universe we have to accept a somewhat revised version of determinism in which, given the state of a system at any one time, the laws of nature determine the <em class="calibre1">probabilities</em> of various different futures and pasts rather than dictating the future and past precisely. As Hawking puts it, ‘Nature allows a number of different eventualities, each with a certain likelihood of being realized.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch20ref12" id="rch20ref12">12</a></sup> You can test a quantum theory by repeating an experiment many times, noting how frequently different results occur and whether the frequency of their occurrence fits the probabilities the theory predicted.</p>
<p class="indent">Hawking mentions again the ideas that he and I discussed in the old DAMTP common room back in 1996, ideas for which some people were criticizing him at that time. His words to me back then were ‘We never have a model-independent view of reality. But that doesn’t mean <span id="page422">there</span> is no model-independent reality. If I didn’t think there is, I couldn’t go on doing science.’ Now, in <em class="calibre1">The Grand Design</em>, he writes, in italics for emphasis, ‘<em class="calibre1">There is no picture- or theory-independent concept of reality</em>.’ He goes on to say that this is ‘a conclusion that will be important in this book’. This statement rephrases the first part of his statement to me, substituting ‘concept’ for ‘view’, but not the second part. We are left to wonder whether the rest still holds.</p>
<p class="indent">Hawking lists two other ways of thinking about ‘reality’ that he is rejecting. One is the ‘realist’ viewpoint of classical science based on the belief that a real, external world exists, a world that can be measured and analysed – that is the same for every observer who studies it. The other is what Hawking calls the ‘anti-realist’ viewpoint. This viewpoint is so insistent on confining itself to empirical knowledge gleaned through experiment and observation that it has little use for theory and ends up self-destructing with the notion that because anything we learn is filtered through our brains, we can’t really count on there <em class="calibre1">being</em> such a thing as empirical knowledge.</p>
<p class="indent">Hawking believes that his own ‘model-dependent realism’ makes the argument between realism and anti-realism unnecessary. He insists it is only meaningful to ask whether a model agrees with observation, not whether it is ‘real’. If more than one model agrees with observation, you don’t have to argue which is more ‘real’ or ‘right’. ‘Our perception – and hence the observations upon which our theories are based – is not direct, but rather is shaped by a kind of lens, the interpretive structure of our human brains.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch20ref13" id="rch20ref13">13</a></sup> That goes for everyday experience, he says, not just in science. On that level too, whether we are <span id="page423">consciously</span> devising models or not, we never have a model-independent view of reality. Nevertheless, our model-dependent views of reality are not worthless. They are the way human beings come to understand and manage their world. Models stand and fall as they continue or cease to match observation and experience.</p>
<p class="indent">It isn’t difficult to agree with Hawking. Unless I am in a state of denial – which we all probably are in part, sometimes – I do make my learning-progress through life in precisely that way. You and I come from different sets of experiences. Perhaps we might be able to agree to disagree without making claims about who is ‘right’ and who is ‘wrong’. Would Hawking go so far as to apply his philosophy to the more extreme views that divide our world? That, possibly, is where he would invoke something like the second, decidedly Platonic, part of his statement, perhaps to say, ‘But that does not mean there are no such things as “right” and “wrong”; if I didn’t think there are, I couldn’t go on living in any meaningful way.’ On the other hand, there are claims that human values are products of our evolutionary history. In this way of thinking, ‘right’ is what has aided the survival of our species – nothing more profound or fundamental than that. If that is true (and what, after all, does ‘truth’ come down to in a discussion like this?), then model-independent <em class="calibre1">morality</em> is perhaps as illusive as model-independent reality.</p>
<p class="indent">Be that as it may, Hawking’s discussion of ‘reality’ helps with something you may have been wondering about since <a href="../Text/chapter_002.html">Chapter 2</a>. If no one has actually seen, for example, an electron, how do we know electrons are ‘real’?</p>
<p class="indent">Though it’s true that no one has ever seen an electron, <span id="page424">electrons</span> are a useful ‘model’ that makes sense of observations of tracks in a cloud chamber or spots of light on a television tube. The model has been applied with enormous success in both fundamental science and engineering. But are electrons real? Though a great many physicists would say, yes, of course they are, that question according to Hawking is meaningless.</p>
<p class="indent">‘Model-dependent realism’, as he calls it, is a useful way of thinking about dualities – those situations in which two different, perhaps mutually exclusive, descriptions are necessary to gain a better understanding than either description alone can provide. Neither theory is ‘better’ or more ‘real’ than the other. Recall the most familiar example, wave–particle duality, which emerged in the early twentieth century with the discovery that when light interacts with matter it acts as though it must be particles, while experiments with the way light travels show that it acts as though it were waves.</p>
<p class="indent">All of which brings us back to think more knowledge-ably about M-theory. As we’ve said, it appears that no mathematical model is able to describe every aspect of the universe. Each theory in the M-theory family can describe a certain range of phenomena. When these ranges overlap, the theories agree. In this manner they are all parts of the same theory, just as the smaller sections of the map in Hawking’s analogy were all parts of the same map. But no single theory in the family is capable of describing all the forces of nature and the particles that we mentioned in <a href="../Text/chapter_002.html">Chapter 2</a>, plus the framework of time and space where the universe game plays out. If this seemingly fragmented map is where the great quest must end, so be it, ‘it is acceptable within the framework of model-dependent <span id="page425">reality’</span>.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch20ref14" id="rch20ref14">14</a></sup> We have no more fundamental theory that we can claim is <em class="calibre1">independent</em> of the models we know.</p>
<p class="indent">Hawking and Mlodinow write that all the universes in the multiverse were created out of nothing, arising naturally from physical law, and that they require no creator. They have oversimplified a bit to make their point. In eternal-inflation theory, which Hawking favours, universes don’t arise from nothing. They arise from other universes. Somewhere in the past, there may have been a first universe and a first inflation sequence, where it all started off, or the repeating self-replication process may stretch back eternally into the past. Presumably the origin of that first universe (if there <em class="calibre1">was</em> a ‘first universe’) can be explained by the no-boundary-proposal, which leaves us precisely where <em class="calibre1">A Brief History of Time</em> stopped, asking those same profound questions that left plenty of room for God.</p>
<p class="indent"><em class="calibre1">The Grand Design</em>, however, addresses another puzzle, the fine-tuning mystery. Some who believe in God – <em class="calibre1">still</em> not warned off the God-of-the-Gaps theology which clings to instances where something seems unexplainable without God – will no doubt find it distressing that Hawking and Mlodinow have very successfully shown another plausible explanation, using the top-down method and multiverses. If you believe in God only as a necessary explanation, Hawking has once again cut you adrift. More interesting than the media attention Hawking’s books gain for God/science issues is the fact that, for careful, thoughtful readers, they do lead to some profound inner debates. Those don’t always end the way Hawking might expect.</p>
<p class="indent">In their final chapter, Hawking and Mlodinow address <span id="page426">the</span> question of where the physical laws come from, introducing the discussion with the following comment: ‘The laws of nature tell us <em class="calibre1">how</em> the universe behaves, but they don’t answer <em class="calibre1">why</em>.’ At the end of <em class="calibre1">A Brief History of Time</em> Hawking had written that the answer to that question would be to know the mind of God. Now he has broken the question into three parts: ‘Why this particular set of laws and not some other?’, ‘Why is there something rather than nothing?’ (the laws being part of the ‘something’) and ‘Why do we exist?’</p>
<p class="indent">To help address the first of those questions, Hawking and Mlodinow list the laws that are necessary in a physical universe that looks like our own. They must be a set of laws that have a concept of energy in which the amount of energy is constant, not changing over time. Another requirement is that the laws must dictate that the energy of any isolated body surrounded by empty space will be positive. And there must be a law like gravity. The theory of this gravity must have supersymmetry between the forces of nature and the particles of matter they govern. Adopting the top-down method, the answer to ‘Why this particular set of laws and not some other?’ can be simply ‘Because any other set of laws would make it impossible for us to be here asking that question.’ That would be an answer invoking the anthropic principle, but M-theory has a little more to say on the issue than that: because of all the different ways the extra dimensions curl up, with each universe having laws determined by how they curl in that universe, there <em class="calibre1">will</em> certainly be a universe around that has these laws.</p>
<p class="indent">To help address the third of those questions (‘Why do we exist?’), Hawking and Mlodinow introduce us to a <span id="page427">computer</span> game known as ‘The Game of Life’. It’s a fascinating game, invented back in 1970 by John Horton Conway, then a Cambridge mathematician. The layout looks like a chessboard, with some squares ‘alive’ and some ‘dead’. A very simple set of rules dictate ‘deaths’, ‘births’ and ‘survival’ as the game moves from ‘generation to generation’. It soon becomes evident that extremely simple rules can play out in very complicated ways. Remember the ‘alien who has never experienced our universe’ in <a href="../Text/chapter_002.html">Chapter 2</a>. Someone coming in on this game after it’s been going a while will be in a similar position, able to deduce ‘laws’ from what’s going on, laws that seem to govern the formation and behaviour of elaborate groupings of the live and dead squares – laws that however are not among the simple original laws at all but that arise out of them. The game is a simple example of ‘emergent complexity’ or ‘self-organizing systems’. It helps us comprehend, for example, how the stripes on a zebra or patterns on a flower petal occur from a tissue of cells growing together.</p>
<p class="indent">Conway invented this game as an attempt to find out whether in a ‘universe’ with extremely simple fundamental rules, objects would emerge that were complex enough to replicate themselves. In the game, they do. They could even, in a sense, be thought of as ‘intelligent’. The bottom line is that a very simple set of laws is capable of producing complexity similar to that of intelligent life. In Hawking’s words, ‘It is easy to imagine that slightly more complicated laws would allow complex systems with all the attributes of life.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch20ref15" id="rch20ref15">15</a></sup> There is disagreement as to whether such life would be self-aware.</p>
<p class="indent">That may seem to answer the question ‘Why do we <span id="page428">exist</span>?’ Is it a complete answer? In the Game of Life, it doesn’t matter what pattern you start with – any ‘initial conditions’ will give you those same sorts of results – but not just any set of laws, because it is the laws that determine the evolution of the system. Which refers back to the first question: ‘Why this particular set of laws and not some other?’</p>
<p class="indent">Summing up so far, then, with regard to Hawking’s three questions, he and Mlodinow have answered the first (‘Why this particular set of laws and not some other?’) for our own universe with the idea that we have a particular set of laws because of the way the extra dimensions are curled up. Can they answer it for the overarching laws that govern the entire string theory landscape, the entire multiverse, the laws we do not yet know? They have said that of all the supersymmetric theories of gravity, M-theory is the most general, making it the only candidate for a complete theory of the universe. ‘Candidate’ it still is, awaiting proof, but Hawking believes it promises to be a model of a multiverse that includes us, because there is no other consistent model.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch20ref16" id="rch20ref16">16</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">They have answered the third question (‘Why do we exist?’) by saying that, in the multitude of possible universes, a universe that allows for our existence is highly probable and, from there, even if there were only a very simple set of laws in place (dictated by the way the extra dimensions curl), it is not difficult to arrive at us (think of the game).</p>
<p class="indent">The second of the questions (‘Why is there something rather than nothing?’) is more fundamental and much more difficult. An answer would have to account for much more than our universe, its laws and us. It would <span id="page429">have</span> to account for the very existence of the unknown theory that underlies the M-theory family of theories. Hawking thinks the multiverse ruled by this family of theories ‘creates itself’, but he does not explain how. Even the often-heard statement that ‘nothingness is unstable and tends to decay into something’ implies that a certain set of probabilities must already be in place. This question – ‘Why is there something rather than nothing?’ – Hawking and Mlodinow have left unanswered.</p>
<p class="indent">Though many of Hawking’s colleagues have high hopes indeed for M-theory, few join him in his enormous optimism about its total explanatory power. There were questions that hung in the air at the close of <em class="calibre1">A Brief History of Time</em>, eloquently stated, evoking grand hopes that we might some day solve these mysteries. The attempt actually to answer all of them in <em class="calibre1">The Grand Design</em> falls short.</p>
<p class="indent">Critics of the book were not enthusiastic, and their lack of enthusiasm seemed based not on disagreement with the authors but on disappointment that this was not a more powerful book. <em class="calibre1">The Economist</em> commented that ‘whenever the going threatens to get tough, the authors retreat into hand-waving and move briskly on’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch20ref17" id="rch20ref17">17</a></sup> … ‘There are actually rather a lot of questions that are more subtle than the authors think.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch20ref18" id="rch20ref18">18</a></sup> As for the claim that the ideas presented in the book have passed every experimental test to which they have been put, that is ‘misleading’ … ‘It is the bare bones of quantum mechanics that have proved to be consistent with what is presently known of the sub-atomic world. The authors’ interpretations and extrapolations of it have not been subjected to any decisive tests, and it is not clear that they ever could be.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch20ref19" id="rch20ref19">19</a></sup> Dwight Garner, in <span id="page430"><em class="calibre1">The</em></span> <em class="calibre1">New York Times</em>, wrote that ‘the real news about “The Grand Design” is how disappointingly tinny and inelegant it is. The spare and earnest voice that Mr. Hawking employed with such appeal in “A Brief History of Time” has been replaced here by one that is alternately condescending, as if he were Mr. Rogers explaining rain clouds to toddlers, and impenetrable.’ Garner also accused Hawking of ‘Godmongering’, as the writer Timothy Ferris has called it, when an author who is not religious makes statements about God and religious belief solely to sell books.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch20ref20" id="rch20ref20">20</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent-bs">There is nothing disappointing or feeble, however, about the ‘top-down’ approach and Hawking’s and Mlodinow’s presentation of M-theory. Hawking’s statement about their implications for the study of science is one of the best passages in the book. Hawking believes we are:</p>
<p class="quote-jy-bs">at a critical point in the history of science, in which we must alter our conception of goals and of what makes a physical theory acceptable. It appears that the fundamental numbers, and even the form, of the apparent laws of nature are not demanded by logic or physical principle. The parameters are free to take on any values and the laws to take on any form that leads to a self-consistent mathematical theory, and they do take on different values and different forms in different universes. That may not satisfy our human desire to be special or to discover a neat package to contain all the laws of physics, but it does seem to be the way of nature.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch20ref21" id="rch20ref21">21</a></sup></p>
<p class="noindent">What does it mean for banishing belief in God? The <span id="page431">disparagement</span> of belief in <em class="calibre1">The Grand Design</em> is much more frequent and assertive than in Hawking’s other books. But the more grand the design becomes – and Hawking’s is a spectacularly grand design – the more those readers who find Hawking’s science convincing <em class="calibre1">and also</em> believe in God are bound to find cause for wonder in the elegant complexity of the multiverse vision.</p>
<p class="indent">The religious discussion, sometimes heated, erupted as soon as the book reached reviewers and the public. Perusing all that, one is surprised to find how many of the discussants, coming from both viewpoints, clearly have not read Hawking’s and Mlodinow’s book. Among those who have, it is perhaps not so surprising to find atheists who nevertheless do not feel that Hawking and Mlodinow succeed in banishing the need for a creator, and theists who think he has done a pretty thorough job of it. It seems that one’s atheism or theism can remain essentially untouched by Hawking’s arguments, perhaps because such choices are very often based on reasons that have nothing to do with science. Among those who disagree with Hawking, the most interesting arguments take two forms.</p>
<p class="indent">(1) In spite of the hugely comprehensive explanatory power of Hawking’s model – and even if this should some day turn out to be model-<em class="calibre1">independent</em> reality – a question that is as old as human thought is still left hanging: why is there something – a grand design – rather than nothing? The ‘something’ in the M-theory model is far, far grander and more extensive than has ever been proposed before. But why is there anything to have a model of? Granted, a religious answer to that question, ‘God’, does no better than a scientific one which argues that ‘There is a <span id="page432">fundamental</span> mathematical logic that does not allow “nothing”’. ‘God’ and ‘mathematical logic’ are both, indeed, ‘something’, so both prompt a question: who created God? Who set down the mathematical logic?</p>
<p class="indent">You might expect Hawking to say that we, the observers, are the answer. Where the buck stops. No need to ask who or what created us. We are here. Our presence ‘chooses’ that all the rest of it exists. No other argument is possible or needed.</p>
<p class="indent">Hawking does not use that argument. Not in his book, nor when he and I spoke in his office in November 2010. I mentioned the question he had posed in <em class="calibre1">A Brief History of Time</em>: ‘What is it that breathes fire into the equations and makes a universe for them to describe?’ Using top-down thinking, might the answer be – us?, I asked. His reply was ‘No.’</p>
<p class="indent">(2) The second argument relies on the idea of ‘model-dependent reality’. Those who present this argument point out that Hawking and Mlodinow have written that each of us has a personal model of the world that fits our life experience and attempts to make sense of it. Our models will in many ways be the same, but not in all ways, because our experiences are different. Hawking’s model does not have to include any experience of the presence and power of God. He has evidently had no experience of that and no reports of it from people he considers reliable. Why should he make it part of his model? He has no need of it.</p>
<p class="indent">On the other hand, for someone who has had experience of the presence and power of God, Hawking’s model is inadequate. Their model must include that experience. (And if you’ve already decided such experience can’t be <span id="page433">‘real</span>’, then you’re already violating the tenets of ‘model-dependent reality’ and should leave this discussion.) Suppose that in addition to having experience of God you agree with Hawking’s science. Perhaps you are a physicist. Then your model will also have to include not only God but all the amazing findings and speculations of twentieth-and twenty-first-century scientists. Are you in trouble?</p>
<p class="indent">Luckily, a model that includes both belief in God and in science has not been ruled out by either <em class="calibre1">A Brief History of Time</em> or <em class="calibre1">The Grand Design</em>. It is possible and not crazy, at least according to many of Hawking’s colleagues, and both theists and atheists who have entered the debate. Read <em class="calibre1">The Grand Design</em> carefully and with an open mind, and you will probably agree that is so. We have, then, two different models, one with God and one without. According to ‘model-dependent reality’, it is meaningless even to ask whether one is more ‘real’ than the other, and inconsistent for Hawking to be so sure that his Godless-universe model represents ‘reality’.</p>
<p class="indent-bs">You may be thinking that it is not appropriate to apply model-dependent reality to our personal world-views, but Hawking seems to think it is when he states:</p>
<p class="quote-jy-bs">Our brains interpret the input from our sensory organs by making a model of the outside world. We form mental concepts of our home, trees, other people, the electricity that flows from wall sockets, atoms, molecules and other universes. These mental concepts are the only reality we can know. There is no model-independent test of reality.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch20ref22" id="rch20ref22">22</a></sup></p>
<p class="noindent">Undeniably our models will include more than these <span id="page434">physical</span> attributes of the universe. They will, as we’ve said, include convictions of what is right and what is wrong. In an extreme case: are we required to respect a ‘model’ created through a lens of hatred, selfishness and prejudice? We know from Hawking’s public statements regarding human rights and politics that at least on a practical level he does not extend model-dependent reality to include model-dependent morality.</p>
<p class="h">In My Mind I am Free</p>
<p class="noindent">When Stephen Hawking and I were first discussing my plans for this book in November 2010, he asked me to be sure to include his latest ideas about eternal inflation and the observations he suggests could help verify it. You read about that in <a href="../Text/chapter_019.html">Chapter 19</a>. His second request was that I not fail to mention his new television series that would be shown in the UK early in 2011. It is a three-part documentary called, in Britain, <em class="calibre1">Stephen Hawking’s Universe</em> (using the same title as an earlier series) and, in the USA, <em class="calibre1">Into the Universe with Stephen Hawking</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">This time it is not from a lecture hall or his office that Hawking invites us to join him on an adventure through time and space, but from the Hall of his college, Gonville and Caius. The long wooden tables have been pushed back against the walls. Hawking sits in his wheelchair, alone in the splendid wood-panelled room. His portrait can be seen on the wall along with portraits of other college luminaries of the past and present. In the familiar voice, he begins: ‘Hello. My name is Stephen Hawking: physicist, cosmologist and something of a dreamer. Although I cannot move, and I have to speak through a computer, in my mind I am free.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch20ref23" id="rch20ref23">23</a></sup> That proves to be <span id="page435">abundantly</span> correct as we voyage with him far out into the universe, in time and space, to encounter the wonders he knows or has good reason to believe are there, and into his own imagination to find the landscapes and creatures he thinks we <em class="calibre1">might</em> find. In this spectacularly filmed triptych, Hawking, and those responsible for the state-of-the-art computer animation and astronomy photography, succeed in evoking a chilling awareness of the enormous distances and numberless galaxies – the sheer, stupefying, inconceivable vastness of space and time.</p>
<p class="indent">Hawking doesn’t narrate the series himself. Even before his introductory sentence ends, the voice has seamlessly shifted to the voice of Benedict Cumberbatch, the actor who played the young Stephen Hawking in the film <em class="calibre1">Hawking</em>. Occasionally Hawking’s own voice comes back for a few seconds, and so does the scene in the Hall of Caius, just to remind us who’s really telling the tale.</p>
<p class="indent">For the first of the trilogy, the animators and Hawking have invented fantastic extraterrestrials, a few of whom he should shoot down immediately with his rocket-launcher if they ever appear in his office – never mind the Prime Directive. Although Hawking insists that the best place to look if we want to enquire about life in our universe is here at home, where there exists the only <em class="calibre1">known</em> life, he does lead us far beyond Earth and the solar system and our own galaxy. He tells us that there may be life in the cosmos so strange that we wouldn’t recognize it as life. And we hear, with a shudder, that it isn’t ‘what they’re like but what they can <em class="calibre1">do</em> that counts’: for instance, arrive in swarms of advanced-technology spacecraft and within a few seconds pirate all the energy of the sun by encasing it with mirrors, focusing that energy to create a wormhole. <span id="page436">And</span> yes, when it comes to wormholes, Hawking is back in that game, no matter how discouraging some of his recent statements have been about them. It might indeed be possible for a very advanced civilization to create one. Is all of this highly unlikely? Perhaps, but Hawking ends by reminding us of what we learned earlier in the show about our own improbable emergence here on Earth: ‘We only have to look at ourselves to know that extremely unlikely things can and do happen all the time.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch20ref24" id="rch20ref24">24</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">In ‘Time Travel’, the second of the trilogy, Hawking admits to being ‘obsessed by time’. He is particularly curious about ‘how our whole cosmic story ends’. This segment is a tour-de-force overview of the possibility of time travel. Tiny wormholes through space and time constantly form and re-form, linking separate spaces and separate times. Could one be captured and enlarged many trillions of times and used as a time machine? Is travel to the past by this or any other means possible? Hawking has printed an invitation, copies of which he hopes might survive several thousand years, laid out champagne and delicious-looking food, and hung a banner, ‘Welcome, Reception for Future Time Travellers’. His invitation gives all the necessary information and coordinates required to find him and share this feast. No guests arrive. Perhaps none of the invitations survived long enough, but in a Cambridge college, at least one or two of them probably would. Because no one responds to his invitation, and for other reasons, such as a ‘fundamental rule that governs the entire universe’ that cause happens before effect, unsolvable paradoxes, and the inevitable radiation feedback that would destroy a wormhole before you could use it, Hawking concludes that we cannot travel to <span id="page437">the</span> past. But we can to the future, and we needn’t depend on wormholes. Einstein realized that time doesn’t flow at the same rate everywhere, and it’s a well-established fact that he was right. Matter drags on time, slowing it down, and that means a massive body can serve as a time machine. A spacecraft flying near the event horizon of a super-massive black hole, with skilful enough navigation and sufficient speed not to fall in, would make a noticeable jump forward in time. After about five years (in your personal time) at the black hole, you could find that ten years had passed on Earth. Travelling near the speed of light would work much better, though the same slowing of time that makes this a quicker way to get to the future also makes it impossible to travel <em class="calibre1">at</em> or <em class="calibre1">above</em> the speed of light. Passengers travelling near light speed (in a wonderfully conceived train that must circumnavigate the Earth seven times a second) could return after only a week measured in their own personal time, to find the world had moved forward by a hundred years.</p>
<p class="indent">The third segment of the trilogy is a genuine climax to the series. First, Hawking takes us to the early universe to observe the Big Bang. He admits that it would all have been completely dark, because light didn’t exist yet – so you couldn’t actually see it. Space didn’t exist either. There was no ‘outside’ this event from which to view it. ‘All that there was was inside.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch20ref25" id="rch20ref25">25</a></sup> We journey through the inflation era, witness the annihilation of matter and antimatter with the whole future of the universe hanging on there being just a minuscule bit more matter than antimatter, and learn the enormous significance of the force of gravity again and again in creating the universe we know. We see Wheeler’s democracy vividly demonstrated as a <span id="page438">load</span> of ball-bearings roll through the doors into the Hall of Caius. Animation takes over to show them all perfectly equidistant from one another, forming a gridlock that would never have yielded to make ‘our’ universe. But remove just a handful of the ball bearings, one here, one there, from the perfect pattern, and gravity gets a foothold – another example, Hawking points out, of how imperfection is absolutely necessary in our universe. Eventually we do get to the universe as we know it, and beyond. Hawking takes us into the future, and he is a truly amazing ‘futurist’. His plea is eloquent in support of colonizing other planets, and his vision for Earth harrowing. He is still as concerned as he was in his youth about the hazard of nuclear weapons – ‘We are clever enough to design such things, but I’m not sure we are clever enough not to use them’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch20ref26" id="rch20ref26">26</a></sup> – but some of the other possibilities are even more likely to cause nightmares. He also admits that there are staggering obstacles we will encounter in finding another home in the universe.</p>
<p class="indent">What about the question of how our whole cosmic story ends? ‘The fate of the universe,’ he tells us, ‘depends on how dark energy behaves.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch20ref27" id="rch20ref27">27</a></sup> Is it increasing? Will it continue to push space apart, driving the expansion? Will all the particles eventually be so far apart that nothing at all can happen? Or might dark energy’s strength diminish, allowing gravity to pull everything together again in a Big Crunch? We don’t know. That end is a very long way off. Hawking says that on one of his trips to Japan he was requested not to mention the fate of the universe lest it upset the stock market, but he thinks it would be premature to sell up. Hawking’s suggestion for survival at that extremely distant time is that we might find out how <span id="page439">to</span> travel to another universe. We have about thirty billion years to work out how to do that.</p>
<p class="indent">In <em class="calibre1">Into the Universe with Stephen Hawking</em>, Hawking chooses not to disparage belief in God directly. After a stunning series of sequences that show many turning points in the history of the universe where it could so easily have gone wrong, and overwhelming us with the sheer grandeur and elegant genius of it all, he says, in his own voice: ‘Perhaps science has revealed there is some higher authority at work, setting the laws of nature so that our universe and we can exist. So is there a grand designer, who lined up all the good fortune? In my opinion, not necessarily.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch20ref28" id="rch20ref28">28</a></sup> And he goes on to talk about the anthropic principle and the possibility of many different kinds of universes. His goal seems to be to lay out what we know, and what we surmise, and what his opinion is, and to make his audience as excited, awed and curious about the universe as he is. From there, we’re on our own. He even contradicts the claim made in the subtitle of <em class="calibre1">The Grand Design</em>, that we know the ultimate answers. In the final moments of the documentary, he says, ‘Some day we may solve the ultimate mystery … discover why the universe exists at all.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch20ref29" id="rch20ref29">29</a></sup> <em class="calibre1">Into the Universe with Stephen Hawking</em> leaves us not only awed by the universe, but also agape at <em class="calibre1">ourselves</em>, us creatures who have actually managed to discover and understand so astonishingly much. But there still remains that question. Errol Morris, director of the film <em class="calibre1">A Brief History of Time</em>, said there was a challenge he always set himself when he made a film: ‘To extract a situation’s truth without violating its mystery.’ Hawking has met that challenge.</p>
<p class="indent">This magnificent trilogy, with a splendid musical score, <span id="page440">is</span> perhaps close to the dream that was not realized in the film of <em class="calibre1">A Brief History of Time</em>, in spite of Morris’s skills. It is probably what Hawking originally hoped that film would be like, except that in twenty-five years computer animation has vastly improved, and the dream itself has grown exponentially.</p>
<p class="h">2010–2011</p>
<p class="noindent">Before I began writing this book, I went to visit Hawking in his office in November 2010 for the first time in several years. The room had changed only a little. The large picture of Marilyn was not on the wall but, inexplicably, lying on the floor. The photographs of Lucy’s boy William were still there on the shelves, and there was also a small colour photo of Hawking and Elaine lying among other papers near his computer screen. On the end of his desk nearest the door was a mysterious arrangement of stones in a large flat dish, emitting a faint vapour that seems to have no smell, unusual in that it emerges from the stones in flat, wing-like gauzy clouds that look as though they have a tiny hem at the edge. Judith Croasdell, Hawking’s personal assistant, explained that it is a special kind of humidifier, chosen several years ago by Elaine, that makes it easier for Hawking to breathe. The liquid required for it is not ordinary water, and a large supply of bottles takes up a good part of the storage space under the side window. Outside that window is the ‘pavilion’ that was not yet built in 2000, but it doesn’t spoil the view. The office has a tranquil, happy feeling to it.</p>
<p class="indent">My conversation with Hawking took place as usual with both of us sitting behind his desk facing his computer screen. Hawking was controlling the cursor on the screen <span id="page441">by</span> moving his cheek muscle. A small electronic beep came from the contraption attached to the back of his chair when he made a choice on the screen.</p>
<p class="indent">The computer program on the screen looked the same, but he also has the option of using another program. I could not tell how he was making the word choices on that one, and, in fact, it didn’t seem to be operating very well for him. His writing speed had slowed down considerably. I was told that if the cheek or eye movement ceases to work there are other possibilities, including direct connections to the brain. He will deal with that if and when it becomes absolutely necessary. Not every bit of communication requires the computer. If he raises his eyebrows, that means yes. Mouth down means no. You can still tell when he is smiling. Hawking recently had surgery for cataracts and probably doesn’t even really need to wear glasses now, but still does.</p>
<p class="indent">During our conversation the window blinds suddenly went down by themselves as it got darker outside. I had forgotten that such things happen automatically in this ultra-sophisticated building. The nurses changed shift. The one whose shift was ending – a dignified, gentle woman – came over and said goodbye to him without expecting a reply.</p>
<p class="indent">Whenever I talk with Stephen Hawking I try to phrase my questions in ways that allow him to answer with a simple yes or no, though he usually goes on to elaborate anyway. That afternoon I was particularly interested in asking him about what seemed a possible change in his views about independent reality (reflected in <em class="calibre1">The Grand Design</em>) since we discussed that in 1996. I quoted him the words he had used back then: ‘We never have a <span id="page442">model-independent</span> view of reality. But that doesn’t mean there is no model-independent reality. If I didn’t think there is, I couldn’t go on doing science.’ I asked him whether he would change that now to say, ‘Independent reality <em class="calibre1">is</em> that there is no independent reality.’ His answer was ‘I still think there is an underlying reality, it is just that our picture of it is model-dependent.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch20ref30" id="rch20ref30">30</a></sup></p>
<p class="h">A Swipe at Immortality</p>
<p class="noindent">In an interview in the <em class="calibre1">Guardian</em><sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch20ref31" id="rch20ref31">31</a></sup> and a lecture at a ‘Google Zeitgeist’ meeting in London in the spring of 2011, Hawking bluntly revealed part of his own personal picture of reality. His headlined words were ‘There is no heaven or afterlife … that is a fairy story for people afraid of the dark.’ Hawking was, of course, expressing an opinion regarding something about which no one, including himself, has any scientifically provable knowledge whatsoever either for or against, but he explained his position by stating his own view of the human brain. One school of thought among researchers who study the brain sees the brain as a computer and the ‘mind’ as nothing more than a product of it, and Hawking apparently had decided to join this club. ‘I regard the brain,’ he said, ‘as a computer which will stop working when its components fail. There is no heaven or afterlife for broken-down computers.’ Ergo, no heaven or afterlife for us.</p>
<p class="indent">In reply to the interview question ‘How should we live?’, Hawking said, ‘We should seek the greatest value of our action.’</p>
<p class="indent">There were, not surprisingly, numerous responses to Hawking’s interview. Although some read it as a declaration of atheism, others pointed out that his statement was <span id="page443">about</span> belief in human immortality, not about belief in God. Not everyone who believes there is a God also believes in heaven or an afterlife. Other readers noted that it is often possible to transfer the entire intellectual content of a computer to a new computer or even a ‘memory stick’ as an old computer dies, and asked facetiously whether this might represent a sort of transmigration of the soul.</p>
<p class="indent">The <em class="calibre1">Guardian</em> printed one thoughtful response in full, even though it was longer than the original interview article itself.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch20ref32" id="rch20ref32">32</a></sup> The respondent, Michael Wenham, like Hawking, has ALS. ‘For someone “facing the prospect of an early death”,’ Wenham wrote, ‘with probably an unpleasant prelude, the idea of extinction holds no more fear than sleep. It really is insulting to accuse me of believing there might be life after death because I’m afraid of the dark.’ Wenham called Hawking’s statement ‘both sad and misinformed. Openness to the theoretical possibility of there being 11 dimensions and fundamental particles “as yet undiscovered” shows an intellectual humility strangely at odds with writing off the possibility of other dimensions of existence.’</p>
<p class="indent">Wenham ended his response: ‘I can’t prove it of course, but on good grounds I’d stake my life on it, that beyond death will be another great adventure; but first I have to finish this one.’</p>
<p class="indent">Perhaps Stephen Hawking is up for another bet?</p>
<p class="h">Going On</p>
<p class="noindent">Hawking currently has two graduate students, and he still holds court in the common room at teatime, for there <em class="calibre1">is</em> now a common room only a short distance from <span id="page444">Hawking’s</span> office door, around the curve in the corridor, past the lift. A sign over the entrance reads ‘Potter Room’, but officially it is the ‘Centre for Theoretical Cosmology’ and is used not only at teatime but for meetings, lectures and conferences. The room is large and pleasant, with low tables, chairs and a counter for serving food and beverages in one corner, dimly lit as the common room in Silver Street was for most of the day. Large black chalk-boards – something the old common room lacked – cover a good part of two walls. I have never seen them without equations scribbled on them. In one corner of the room a bust of Hawking – the Director of Research for the Centre – stands on a plinth. It is a splendid likeness by the sculptor Ian Walters.</p>
<p class="indent">Hawking still lives in the large house that he built for himself and Elaine. He still goes often to concerts and the opera, especially Wagner – <em class="calibre1">Tannhäuser</em> planned for the next week at Covent Garden, when I visited him in November – though he hasn’t been to Bayreuth recently. He still travels, when possible by private jet. In January 2011, he was once again at Caltech. When he attended a play in Los Angeles, <em class="calibre1">33 Variations</em>, in which Jane Fonda portrayed a musicologist in the early stages of ALS, Fonda seemed, in news reports, as thrilled to meet him as many fans would be to meet Jane Fonda. In March 2011, I had to rush to get a set of questions to Hawking before he headed back across the Atlantic to a conference at ‘Cook’s Branch’ near Houston, Texas, a rural conference centre in a nature reserve where physicists from around the world gather yearly for meetings, eager to see one another, eager to sink their teeth into theoretical questions that leave the rest of us gaping, eager to rough it a bit, <span id="page445">sleeping</span> in bungalows with lazily turning ceiling fans.</p>
<p class="indent-bs">In Cambridge, and when he visits Seattle or Arizona, where Lucy spends part of her time, Hawking’s family – now including three grandchildren (Lucy’s William, and Robert and Katrina’s two children), and Jane and Jane’s husband Jonathan – are comfortable with him. There is the new closeness to Lucy that developed when they wrote their books together. In an interview in April 2011, Hawking was asked, if time travel were possible, what moment in his own past he would revisit, what was the best moment of all. His answer was: ‘I would go back to 1967, and the birth of my first child, Robert. My three children have brought me great joy.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch20ref33" id="rch20ref33">33</a></sup> His mother Isobel, at the time of writing, is still alive, well into her nineties, and still orders him about occasionally. She has said, frankly:</p>
<p class="quote-jy-bs">Not all the things Stephen says probably are to be taken as gospel truth. He’s a searcher, he is looking for things. And if sometimes he may talk nonsense, well, don’t we all? The point is, people must think, they must go on thinking, they must try to extend the boundaries of knowledge; yet they don’t sometimes even know where to start. You don’t know where the boundaries are, do you?<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch20ref34" id="rch20ref34">34</a></sup></p>
<p class="noindent">John Wheeler called those boundaries, those frontiers not just of science but of human knowledge, ‘the flaming ramparts of the world’. And, yes, we do know where those are. Not only somewhere out there in the distance. They fill our world.</p>
<p class="indent-bs">As Hawking has said about his own adventures on the ramparts:</p>
<p class="quote-jy-bs" id="page446">With hindsight it might appear that there had been a grand and premeditated design to address the outstanding problems concerning the origin and evolution of the universe. But it was not really like that. I did not have a master plan; rather I followed my nose and did whatever looked interesting and possible at the time.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch20ref35" id="rch20ref35">35</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Stephen Hawking returned to Cambridge from Texas and Arizona – where he had been visiting Lucy and William – in mid-April 2011, on the day I finished writing this book. Joan Godwin went over to cook him something to eat. His office was all set for him, the stones were emitting their vapour. ‘The Boss’ was back, ready to go on with his adventures as long as his health and his ability to communicate hold out … a child who has never grown up … still asking how and why questions … occasionally finding an answer that satisfies him … for a while.</p>
