<p class="chaptitle">‘I’ve always gone in a somewhat different direction’</p>
<p class="noindent"><span><span class="small">‘IT IS ASTONISHING</span></span> that bold predictions of events in the first moments of the universe now can be confronted with solid measurements,’ exclaimed WMAP’s principal investigator, Charles Bennett, in March 2008.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch19ref1" id="rch19ref1">1</a></sup> ‘Fifth year results’ had shown that the WMAP satellite’s data was placing tighter constraints on inflation theories while supporting inflation in general. At the same time, WMAP had discovered something no one had predicted – a mysterious break in the overall random distribution of the temperature variations in the CMBR – a ‘cold spot’.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch19ref2" id="rch19ref2">2</a></sup> All that could be said definitively about it was ‘watch this spot’, but so far none of the suggested explanations cause a problem for inflation theory.</p>
<p class="indent">The race to find experimental and observational evidence to confirm what had been theoretical for a long time was happening not only out in space but also on the <span id="page389">ground</span> – and deep under it. With the switch-on of the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, on 11 September 2008, expectations were running high that this long-awaited instrument could at last reveal the Higgs boson.</p>
<p class="h">Hawking v. Higgs</p>
<p class="noindent">Peter Higgs had proposed the Higgs boson’s existence in 1964 and seen it become part of the standard model of cosmological theory. At a press conference in 2008 he reacted heatedly – ‘launched an attack’ was the way the <em class="calibre1">Sunday Times</em> headline put it<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch19ref3" id="rch19ref3">3</a></sup> – to a comment Hawking had made in an interview on the BBC.</p>
<p class="indent">The less than cordial relationship between Higgs and Hawking dated back to 1996. Hawking had published a paper in which he had stated that it would be impossible to observe the Higgs particle. By 2000 he had not been proved wrong. When the Large Electron Positron (LEP) experiment at CERN was finally closed down that year without having produced definitive proof of the Higgs particle, Hawking raked in $100 on a bet with colleague Gordon Kane at the University of Michigan. Another Hawking bet against the Higgs particle was still unsettled, awaiting the end of similar experiments at Fermilab near Chicago. The exchange between Hawking and Higgs pushed the usual limits of heated scientific discussions when Higgs, at a dinner in Edinburgh in 2002, said of Hawking that it was ‘difficult to engage him in discussion, so he has got away with pronouncements in a way that other people would not. His celebrity status gives him instant credibility that others do not have.’ Hawking countered with: ‘I would hope one could discuss scientific issues without personal attacks’, and Higgs privately made peace by explaining to <span id="page390">Hawking</span> the context of his comments. Hawking said he was not offended, and things settled down, but Hawking never swerved from his opinion that the Higgs particle was beyond the reach of any experiment.</p>
<p class="indent">In a press conference shortly before the switch-on date for the LHC in September 2008, Hawking opened old wounds with the comment that he thought ‘it will be much more exciting if we don’t find the Higgs. That will show something is wrong, and we need to think again. I have a bet of $100 that we won’t find the Higgs.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch19ref4" id="rch19ref4">4</a></sup> Higgs reacted with disparaging remarks about Hawking’s work: ‘From a particle physics, quantum theory point of view, you have to put a lot more than just gravity into the theory to have a consistent theory and I don’t think Stephen has done that. I am very doubtful about his calculations.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch19ref5" id="rch19ref5">5</a></sup> Hawking had argued there might be more interesting outcomes from the LHC, such as the discovery of some of the supersymmetric partners. ‘Their existence would be a key confirmation of string theory,’ said Hawking, ‘and they could make up the mysterious dark matter that holds galaxies together. But whatever the LHC finds, or fails to find, the results will tell us a lot about the structure of the universe.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch19ref6" id="rch19ref6">6</a></sup> The <em class="calibre1">Sunday Times</em> comment that ‘their spat is likely to send shockwaves through the scientific Establishment’ was something of an overstatement, but the 79-year-old Higgs could not be blamed too much for being passionately eager for his theory, finally, to be confirmed.</p>
<p class="indent">Hawking had other fish to fry in the LHC. He had mentioned in his most recent Caltech lecture that he thought it might be possible to observe microscopic black holes resulting from collisions in the Collider. If so, these <span id="page391">black</span> holes should be radiating particles in a pattern we would recognize as Hawking radiation.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch19ref7" id="rch19ref7">7</a></sup> He might get a Nobel Prize.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#FT1pg391" id="rFT1pg391">fn1</a></sup> He had also mentioned again that fluctuations in the CMBR can be thought of as Hawking radiation from the inflationary period of our universe, now frozen in.</p>
<p class="indent">Unfortunately for Higgs and Hawking and a lot of other people, just nine days after the Large Hadron Collider was switched on, CERN had to switch it off again. A faulty electrical connection allowed a helium leak into the tunnel housing the collider and caused the superconductor magnets that steer sub-atomic particles around the collider to malfunction. It took a year to get the LHC back in action.</p>
<p class="indent">The Higgs particle, at the time of this writing, continues to be elusive. As of late February 2011, after a short winter maintenance break, researchers were gearing up for yet another try. ‘We know that we will either discover the Higgs particle or rule it out, and in either case it will be a big result,’ Sergio Bertolucci, CERN’s Director for Research and Scientific Computing, said. ‘Of course, it’s more difficult to sell as a big result if we don’t find it, but if the Higgs doesn’t exist, there must be something else in its place.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch19ref8" id="rch19ref8">8</a></sup></p>
<p class="h">The Time Eater</p>
<p class="noindent">That September of 2008 when Higgs and he were renewing their altercation, Hawking had the honour of <span id="page392">unveiling</span> a harrowingly beautiful addition to the streetscape in the old centre of Cambridge. Corpus Christi College, which has the most ancient court in Cambridge, became home to this newest phenomenon, a very large mechanical clock on the corner where Bene’t Street meets King’s Parade.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch19ref9" id="rch19ref9">9</a></sup> It has no hands but tells the seconds, minutes and hours with what appear to be small flashing blue tear-shaped lights moving in concentric circles around a gleaming clockface that is five feet in diameter. Plated in pure gold, the huge face is designed to look like ripples and troughs radiating out, as if a stone had dropped into a pond of molten metal. The ripples represent the explosion of the Big Bang, sending out pulsating gold.</p>
<p class="indent">The shining contraption honours one of history’s greatest clockmakers, John Harrison, the eighteenth-century pioneer of longitude, one of whose inventions was a ‘grasshopper escapement’. The Corpus clock’s maker and donor, John Taylor, was an undergraduate at Corpus in the 1950s and has since been a phenomenally successful inventor. He also has a passion for old clocks. Taylor chose to make his ‘grasshopper’ a fearsome, crusty giant locust. This beast, at once menacing, beautiful and whimsical, creeps inexorably along the top rim of the clock. It operates by putting its claws into the teeth of the great clockwork escape wheel that rotates around the outer edge of the clock face and, like Harrison’s grass-hopper, restrains and measures out the speed of rotation. This sinister monster is the ‘chronophage’ or ‘time eater’.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch19ref10" id="rch19ref10">10</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">When the Corpus clock strikes the hour it tolls off the numbers not with chimes but with a rattle made by shaking iron chains over a wooden coffin, with a hammer beating the wooden lid, all inside the back of the clock.</p>
<p class="indent" id="page393">It seemed appropriate that Hawking should unveil this awesome device. Nearly everyone associates Stephen Hawking with the Big Bang and time’s ‘brief history’. He has tamed time by turning it into another space dimension. He has also seemed miraculously to have stretched out his own time – defying, perhaps, that horrific creature on top of the clock.</p>
<p class="h">A quieter celebration</p>
<p class="noindent">But time was indeed passing, even for Hawking. A year later, on 30 September 2009, obeying a dictum of the University of Cambridge that Lucasian Professors of Mathematics retire at the age of sixty-seven, he relinquished the title he had held for thirty years. His successor would be Michael Green, a distinguished theoretical physicist specializing in string theory.</p>
<p class="indent-bs">In contrast to the celebration of Hawking’s sixtieth birthday, his stepping down as Lucasian Professor was marked quietly with a champagne reception in the department. His retirement meant little change. His busy schedule, his research, his status in the DAMTP stayed much the same. His title would now be Director of Research for the Cambridge Centre for Theoretical Cosmology. He kept his spacious corner office, and his personal assistant and graduate assistant were not ejected from the cluster of offices around him. In an audio message to BBC <em class="calibre1">Newsnight</em>, Hawking reiterated that he was not really retiring, merely changing titles, and added:</p>
<p class="quote-jy-bs">It has been a glorious time to be alive and doing research in theoretical physics. Our picture of the universe has changed a great deal in the last forty years, and I’m happy <span id="page394">if</span> I have made a small contribution. I want to share my excitement and enthusiasm. There’s nothing like the Eureka moment of discovering something that no one knew before. I won’t compare it to sex, but it lasts longer.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch19ref11" id="rch19ref11">11</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">For the past year, Hawking had been making threatening statements about the possibility of his leaving Cambridge and England – his way of protesting at the proposed draconian cuts in public funding for the kind of basic research he does and the kind of scientific education that he tries to inspire young people to choose. Funds were to be channelled instead into industrial applications of science, science that some thought would bring money into the UK. Hawking had been protesting about such priorities – calling them ‘ignorant of the past, and blind to the future’ – for over a decade. ‘To demand that research projects should all be industrially relevant is ridiculous. How many of the great discoveries of the past that laid the foundations for our modern technology were made through industrially motivated research? The answer is, hardly any.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch19ref12" id="rch19ref12">12</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">If he moved, where would he go? Hawking had enjoyed working as a visitor at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics, a state-of-the-art research centre in Waterloo, Ontario, where Neil Turok was now Director. There were rumours that in retirement he would take up a post there. However, Hawking did not abandon Cambridge and probably never will. In spite of change of title, funding cuts, and inexorably deteriorating physical condition and ability to communicate his ideas, his goal remained as mind-bogglingly ambitious as ever: ‘A <span id="page395">complete</span> understanding of the universe, why it is as it is, and why it exists at all.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch19ref13" id="rch19ref13">13</a></sup> And how long was that going to take? In an interview on the <em class="calibre1">Charlie Rose Show</em>, the previous year, Hawking had been asked that question. He had replied by repeating the words he had used in 1980, in his inaugural lecture as Lucasian Professor: ‘by the end of the century’. Then he added with a cagey grin that though his estimate remained the same, there was a lot more of the twenty-first century left than there had been of the twentieth when he first made that prediction.</p>
<p class="indent">Hawking’s graduate assistant, Sam Blackburn, had set 2009 off with a literal bang by courageously giving him a mini-rocket-launcher for his birthday. With this ‘office toy’, he could send missiles sailing across the room. In March he had travelled to Los Angeles and met his granddaughter Rose for the first time. He and Lucy had dedicated the second of their ‘George’ books to her. Rose and her older brother George are children of Robert Hawking and his wife Katrina.</p>
<p class="indent">Hawking made another of his lecture stops in Pasadena, California. The frenzy of the occasion was not at all unusual for him. It was happening several times, sometimes even <em class="calibre1">many</em> times, every year, and even at Caltech, by then almost home territory.</p>
<p class="h">Space, the Final Frontier</p>
<p class="noindent">Heralded by the opening fanfare from Richard Strauss’s <em class="calibre1">Also Sprach Zarathustra</em>, he made his entrance to the convention centre, filled to capacity with 4,500 people. Those who didn’t know the music by that name still recognized it as the thundering background music of the film <em class="calibre1">2001: A Space Odyssey</em>. Hawking could no longer use his hands <span id="page396">to</span> drive his own wheelchair, a sad change, but, hands folded in his lap, he was wheeled down the aisle at considerable speed. The <em class="calibre1">Blue Danube Waltz</em> – not quite so huge and impressive, more friendly – replaced Richard Strauss with Johann Strauss as he started up the ramp to the stage. The audience waited. Nothing happened for a little while. A glitch? A way of heightening expectation? Hawking’s graduate assistant came out and made some adjustments to Hawking’s laptop. Hawking’s hands remained immobile in his lap. He was controlling his computer with a movement of his cheek muscle. Soon came the voice and the words everyone was waiting for: ‘Can you hear me?’ The Caltech crowd cheered. Stephen Hawking was back!</p>
<p class="indent">Hawking’s lecture was ‘Why We Should Go into Space’,<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch19ref14" id="rch19ref14">14</a></sup> which he had written the previous year as a fiftieth-birthday present for NASA and delivered in Washington, DC. It was a more adult version of the chapter by that same title in the ‘User’s Guide to the Universe’ in <em class="calibre1">George’s Cosmic Treasure Hunt</em>, published in 2007. One part of the talk that he had not included in that book had to do with the cost of space travel, which Hawking admitted would not come cheap but would still represent only a small fraction of world GDP, even if the present USA national budget for space exploration were to be increased twenty times. He recommended a goal of a base on the moon by 2020 and a manned landing on Mars by 2025, not only in the interest of space exploration but to reignite public interest in space and science in general. ‘A high proportion of space scientists say their interest in science was sparked by watching the moon landings,’ he said.</p>
<p class="indent" id="page397">Would we find life out there? Hawking was thinking that even if the probability is small of life appearing on a suitable planet, in a universe as large as ours, life must have appeared somewhere else besides Earth. The distances between the places where it has appeared were likely to be extremely large and the life would almost certainly not all be DNA-based. Another possibility is that meteors may have spread life from planet to planet and even from stellar system to stellar system. If life spread in this way (the process is called panspermia) then it would not be surprising to find other DNA-based life at locations in our own neck of the woods.</p>
<p class="indent">One bit of evidence that panspermia may have been the source of life on Earth, he pointed out, is that life here appeared suspiciously quickly after the first moment that it would have been possible. The Earth was formed 4.6 billion years ago and for the first half-billion years was too hot for life to emerge. The earliest evidence of life comes from 3.5 billion years ago. That means life appeared only about a half a billion years after it was first possible. A long time, that might seem, but actually amazingly short.</p>
<p class="indent">We haven’t of course been visited by aliens (at least, we don’t think so – ‘Why should they appear only to cranks and weirdos?’) and there seem to be no advanced, intelligent beings near us in the galaxy. The SETI project has heard no alien TV quiz shows. There is probably no alien civilization at our stage of development within a few hundred light years of us. ‘Issuing an insurance policy against abduction by aliens seems a pretty safe bet.’</p>
<p class="indent">Hawking mentioned three possible reasons why we haven’t heard from any aliens.</p>
<p class="indent" id="page398">First, the probability of life appearing on a suitable planet may be too low.</p>
<p class="indent">Second, even if that probability is high, the probability of this life evolving into intelligent life may be too low. (It isn’t clear that intelligence confers long-term survival advantage. Think of bacteria and insects.)</p>
<p class="indent">Third, intelligent beings who reach the stage of sending radio signals also have reached the stage of building nuclear bombs or similar weapons of mass destruction, and they may always destroy themselves very soon. Hawking calls that a sick joke, but he has also said that if extraterrestrial life has not destroyed itself, given the short time-span of life on Earth compared with the age of the universe, it is still unlikely that we would meet an example of alien life at a recognizably human stage. It would either be much more primitive than we are or so advanced that it would regard <em class="calibre1">us</em> as impossibly primitive.</p>
<p class="indent">Hawking favours the second possibility, the rarity not of life but of intelligent life. ‘Some would say it has yet to occur on earth.’ Why are we smiling?</p>
<p class="indent">Hawking’s lecture was long and thoughtful. He answered questions chosen ahead of time from those submitted by students and others in the Caltech community: how close are we to the <em class="calibre1">Star Trek</em> world? Don’t expect warp drive or replicators. We will have to ‘do it the hard way’, slower than light speed. To reach distant destinations we’ll need more than one generation. The journeys would be so long that the crews would even have time to evolve differently, so that the human race would divide into different species.</p>
<p class="indent">At the end of his visit to California, Hawking was not well enough to continue to Phoenix, as had been planned. Lucy appeared there instead and his pre-prepared lecture <span id="page399">was</span> broadcast over speakers. Back home in Cambridge, Hawking was in hospital for observation for a brief time, but all this turned out yet again to be only a temporary setback. He was back in fine form well ahead of an August trip to Washington, DC, to receive a Presidential Medal of Freedom from US President Barack Obama. In September, in Switzerland, where he visited CERN and the University of Geneva, his lecture ‘The Creation of the Universe’ filled one theatre and (by video link) ten other auditoriums.</p>
<p class="indent">It was his appearance in Washington to receive his medal that triggered a comment that unexpectedly drew him into the debate raging in the United States while President Obama was struggling to get a health care bill through Congress. One outspoken opponent of all public health care, disparaging the British system, commented that ‘If Stephen Hawking had been British, he’d be dead by now!’ Hawking responded that he was, of course, British and lived in Cambridge, England, and that ‘the National Health Service has taken great care of me for over forty years. I have received excellent medical attention in Britain. I believe in universal health care.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch19ref15" id="rch19ref15">15</a></sup> Jane Hawking might not have been so upbeat about the NHS, given her disappointments with them.</p>
<p class="indent">In February 2010, the Planetary Society of Pasadena, California, awarded Hawking the Cosmos Award for Outstanding Public Presentation of Science. Previous honorees had been James Cameron, creator of the film <em class="calibre1">Avatar</em>, and <em class="calibre1">NOVA</em> producer Paula Apsell.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch19ref16" id="rch19ref16">16</a></sup> With Hawking’s health again uncertain, a delegation travelled from California to Cambridge to make the presentation. The society’s mission is ‘to inspire the people of Earth to <span id="page400">explore</span> other worlds, understand our own, and seek life elsewhere’. The press release announcing the presentation event in Cambridge ended with the words: ‘Tickets are sold out.’</p>
<p class="indent">Hawking unveiled another reminder of the swift passage of time in the spring of 2010. It was an unusual experience, having a garden named for him at the annual Royal Horticultural Society Chelsea Flower Show in London. The ‘Stephen Hawking Garden for Motor Neurone Disease: A Brief History of Time’ was dedicated not only to him but to all whose lives have been affected by motor neurone disease – patients, families, carers – and it was indeed a garden of mixed emotions. A spiral path representing the Earth’s plant history led visitors from an area with some of the most ancient species of plants and ended near the centre of the garden with ‘productive Mediterranean type plants that could produce food for us in the future, if climatic conditions allow’. At the centre of the garden was a pool in which water appeared to fall into a dark, hopeless vortex – representing a black hole – the end of time. Nearby, set into a drystone wall, was an antique clock, representing the swiftness with which time disappears for those with motor neurone disease. Queen Elizabeth met Hawking in the garden to admire the design, converse with him, and congratulate him.</p>
<p class="h">Verdict from the Skies</p>
<p class="noindent">WMAP ended its mission in 2009. A results summary in January 2010 announced that the large-scale temperature fluctuations in the CMBR are slightly more intense than the small-scale ones – a subtle but key prediction of many inflation models – and confirmed that the universe is <span id="page401">indeed</span> flat.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch19ref17" id="rch19ref17">17</a></sup> This second conclusion was supported even more strongly than before by the overall randomness of locations of hot and cold points in the CMBR.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch19ref18" id="rch19ref18">18</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">As the <span><span class="small">WMAP</span></span> mission was preparing to wind down,<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#FT2pg19" id="rFT2pg19">fn2</a></sup> in May 2009 the European Space Agency launched its Planck satellite. Some of its detectors are designed to operate at a temperature of minus 273.05°C, just a tenth of a degree above absolute zero. A formal release of fully prepared CMBR images, analyses and scientific papers was not expected before 2013, but the ESA made a preliminary announcement of some results in January 2011. ‘We haven’t got to the real treasure yet, the cosmic microwave background itself,’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch19ref19" id="rch19ref19">19</a></sup> said David Southwood, ESA Director of Science and Robotic Exploration. The project’s first goal had been to weed out some foreground sources that hamper studies of the CMBR. Many things may have affected this radiation during the evolution of the universe, ‘a whole lot of dirty astrophysics’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch19ref20" id="rch19ref20">20</a></sup> complicating the picture – irregularities from gravitational lensing, radio sources, black holes, even instrument noise. The Planck scientists had in particular been focusing on the ‘anomalous microwave emission’, a glow associated with dense dusty regions of the galaxy, and been able to confirm that it comes from dust grains set spinning by collisions with either fast-moving atoms or ultraviolet light. Filtering out this microwave ‘fog’ from the data would not distort the CMBR. It would leave the CMBR untouched and allow Planck’s data to reveal the cosmic microwave background in unprecedented detail.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch19ref21" id="rch19ref21">21</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">As observations of the CMBR become more detailed <span id="page402">and</span> precise, it becomes more of a challenge for any model to agree with the findings. Success in hitting that target becomes more and more convincing evidence to support a model. Some models are winnowed out. But, so far, the agreement between observations and predictions having to do with the CMBR and the universe’s overall shape, large-scale smoothness, and smaller-scale structure look promising for inflationary cosmology.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch19ref22" id="rch19ref22">22</a></sup> As John Barrow summed it up, ‘The growing observational evidence for the distinctive pattern of temperature variations in the microwave background radiation means that we take very seriously the idea that our visible portion of the universe underwent a surge of inflation in its very earliest stages.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch19ref23" id="rch19ref23">23</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Gravity waves from the moments right after the Big Bang are predicted to have left a distinct footprint in the CMBR,<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch19ref24" id="rch19ref24">24</a></sup> but this footprint was proving elusive. However, there are other potentially better ways to look for gravity waves. Kip Thorne, because of his abiding interest in black holes, has been working with colleagues for some time to develop instruments that can detect and measure more directly gravity waves that originate in black hole events, and in the early universe. One technique is laser interferometry.</p>
<p class="indent">The interferometer is a device that splits a laser beam into two beams, perpendicular to one another. Each beam bounces off a mirror that sends it back along its path. The two beams are recombined when they meet. Each of the mirrors has a large mass attached to it, so if a gravity wave passes through the interferometer, stretching and contracting space between the masses (and hence the mirrors), that displaces them slightly and changes the distances the beams travel, producing interference patterns in the laser light (<a href="../Text/chapter_019.html#ch19fig1">see Figure 19.1</a>).</p>
<div class="centered-image" id="page403"><a id="ch19fig1"/><img alt="image" class="imagefix22" src="../Images/f0403-01.jpg"/></div>
<p class="caption1"><em class="calibre1">Figure 19.1. Sketch of an Earth-bound gravitational wave interferometer (by courtesy of Kip Thorne)</em></p>
<p class="indent">Earth-based gravity wave detectors are already in place in Hanford, Washington (LIGO); Hanover, Germany; and Pisa, Italy; but the grandmother of all such instruments, an astoundingly outsized arrangement, is scheduled to be launched into space in the form of three separate spacecraft, together known as LISA, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna. Once in place, the three spacecraft will form a triangle with sides 5 million kilometres long. It will take approximately 20 seconds for light to travel between them. (<a href="../Text/chapter_019.html#ch19fig2">See Figure 19.2</a>.) When gravitational waves, stretching and squeezing space, pass through this enormous ‘apparatus’, their passage will alter slightly the distance between the spacecraft, and the distance travelled by the light beams between them, causing an interference of the light beams that can be measured with extremely sensitive instruments.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch19ref25" id="rch19ref25">25</a></sup> LIGO and LISA were two of the instruments that Kip Thorne was talking about when he promised Hawking on his sixtieth birthday that gravitational wave detectors – <span><span class="small">LIGO</span></span>, <span><span class="small">GEO</span></span>, <span><span class="small">VIRGO</span></span> and <span><span class="small">LISA</span></span> – would test his ‘Golden-Age black-hole predictions’ well before his seventieth birthday.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch19ref26" id="rch19ref26">26</a></sup> They had better get cracking!</p>
<div class="centered-image" id="page404"><a id="ch19fig2"/><img alt="image" class="imagefix23" src="../Images/f0404-01.jpg"/></div>
<p class="caption1"><em class="calibre1">Figure 19.2. LISA, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, which ESA and NASA will jointly build, launch and use to monitor low-frequency gravitational waves (by courtesy of Kip Thorne)</em></p>
<p class="indent">Follow-ups to WMAP, Planck and LISA will be the NASA Einstein Inflation Probe, which will focus on the CMBR, and the Big Bang Observer, which will study gravity waves. The two approaches together may lead finally to something no probes or studies, including the highly successful WMAP, have yet been able to give us: <span id="page405">the</span> long-sought understanding of the physical mechanism and energy scales of inflation itself.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch19ref27" id="rch19ref27">27</a></sup> Gravitational waves offer the most direct opportunity we are likely ever to have to probe what the universe was like during the first split second of its existence.</p>
<p class="indent-bs">Will this observational evidence show conclusively whether or not inflation actually did happen? Inflation theory makes predictions about what the patterns and characteristics of the gravitational waves should be like. If they turn out to match those predictions, that will be strong evidence. If no gravitational waves can be detected, that would support another model, the ekpyrotic model of the universe in which inflation does not occur but our universe was created by the exceedingly slow collision of two three-dimensional brane worlds moving in a hidden extra (fourth) dimension of space.</p>
<p class="h">Out on a Limb</p>
<p class="noindent">When it comes to the bigger picture suggested by eternal inflation, it seems such an idea ought to be impossible to test from our blinkered vantage point within our own universe. What evidence could be lying around within our very limited reach?</p>
<p class="indent">Stephen Hawking and his colleagues are far from giving up on the possibility of making relevant predictions that can be set against more precise future observations, perhaps by the Planck satellite. In a paper in September 2010, Hawking, Jim Hartle and Thomas Hertog admitted that there is ‘no way the mosaic structure [of universes] can be observed. We don’t see the whole universe but only a nearly homogeneous region [that lies within the range of our observations], within our past lightcone’.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch19ref28" id="rch19ref28">28</a></sup> <span id="page406">However</span>, in spite of the possibility that much larger fluctuations are observable only on scales much more enormous than we can study – on ‘super horizon scales’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch19ref29" id="rch19ref29">29</a></sup> – they thought that the no-boundary wave function could come to their aid in calculating small departures from homogeneity <em class="calibre1">within</em> the part of the universe that it is possible for us to observe. The absence or presence of randomness in the spectrum of temperature variations in the CMBR does, they claimed, provide useful information about the bigger picture – and whether there <em class="calibre1">is</em> a bigger picture.</p>
<p class="indent">Just as the ‘quantum wave function’ for a particle gives every possible path the particle could follow between two points, the no-boundary wave function represents all the physically possible histories our universe might have had if it began in the way Hartle and Hawking proposed. In a previous paper, in January 2010, they had reported looking at a range of these different universe histories.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch19ref30" id="rch19ref30">30</a></sup> With an infinite number of possibilities, calculating which are more probable was a questionable undertaking. However, Hartle, Hawking and Hertog – without resorting to renormalization procedures of the sort Richard Feynman had called ‘dippy’ when he used them himself to handle infinities – felt confident in coming to some conclusions.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch19ref31" id="rch19ref31">31</a></sup> They divided the universe histories they were studying into two groups.</p>
<p class="indent-bs">First, consider universe models in whose histories eternal inflation is <em class="calibre1">not</em> likely to have played a part. In other words, these are probably not part of a larger scheme of universes produced by eternal inflation. If we live in that kind of universe, and if it appears to us to be like the universe we know today, and if Hartle, Hawking and <span id="page407">Hertog</span> are correct in thinking they can make valid use of the no-boundary wave function in their calculations, then what do those calculations lead us to expect?</p>
<div class="contentsListStyle1">
<ol class="calibre6">
<li class="calibre5">in the <span><span class="small">CMBR</span></span>, on scales we can observe, a certain pattern of non-randomness in the spectrum of temperature variations;</li>
<li class="calibre5">beyond our ability to observe, on huge scales, an over-all homogeneity;</li>
<li class="calibre5">only a small amount of inflation in our past.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p class="noindent">Observations of the CMBR, though they can’t show us item (2), do not seem to back up those predictions.</p>
<p class="indent-bs">So, consider another group of universe models. These universes are likely to be part of an eternal inflation picture. If we live in that kind of universe, and, again, if it appears to us to be like the universe we know today – and if Hartle, Hawking and Hertog are correct in thinking they can make valid use of the no-boundary wave function in their calculations – what do these calculations lead us to expect?</p>
<div class="contentsListStyle1">
<ol class="calibre6">
<li class="calibre5">in the <span><span class="small">CMBR</span></span>, on scales we can observe, a high degree of randomness in the spectrum of temperature variations;</li>
<li class="calibre5">beyond our ability to observe, on huge scales, a significant amount of inhomogeneity;</li>
<li class="calibre5">a longer period of inflation in our past.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p class="noindent">That’s more like it! Or so it seems, so far. The absence or presence of (and the degree of) randomness that we can observe in the CMBR is a key issue.</p>
<p class="indent" id="page408">Hartle, Hawking and Hertog decided, however, to go further out on a limb: their September 2010 paper reported that they calculate that our universe probably ended its inflationary period at the lowest potential value of the field.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch19ref32" id="rch19ref32">32</a></sup> They predict, rather precisely, observations in the area we can observe (within our light cone) – not only that there will be a high degree of randomness in the spectrum of temperature variations in the CMBR, but also the degree and manner in which, if eternal inflation is correct, the distribution and spectrum of the variations will depart from complete randomness.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#FT3pg19" id="rFT3pg19">fn3</a></sup> The departure will be extremely small and not easy to detect.</p>
<p class="indent-bs">Now, we wait to see whether Planck and other future probes will be able to produce precise enough measurements to test those predictions, as well as show a specific pattern of slight fluctuations in temperature in the CMBR predicted by Hawking and Hartle’s no-boundary proposal itself. The Planck satellite may also be able to detect paths of light rays that have been bent in specific ways, indicating that our universe has a geometry predicted by some multiverse and eternal inflation models.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch19ref33" id="rch19ref33">33</a></sup></p>
<p class="h">Down-to-Earth Hawking Radiation</p>
<p class="noindent">While Hawking, Hartle and Hertog had been thinking about what possible evidence might underpin <span id="page409">eternal</span>-inflation theory, another group of physicists were working on an experiment that might just possibly create Hawking radiation, not at the border of a black hole or from an event horizon in the early universe but in a laboratory. Daniele Faccio of the University of Insubria, Italy, and his team of researchers reported in a paper accepted by <em class="calibre1">Physical Review Letters</em> in late September 2010 that they had succeeded.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch19ref34" id="rch19ref34">34</a></sup> Their experiment involved firing laser light into a block of glass.</p>
<p class="indent">The idea is that as the laser pulse moves through the glass block it changes the speed at which light is capable of travelling there (the ‘refractive index’ of the glass). Light near the pulse is slowed more and more as the pulse passes through and the refractive index changes. If a pulse (call it pulse A) were sent chasing after a slower, weaker pulse (pulse B), it would gradually catch up and that would reduce the speed of light near pulse B. Pulse B would slow down more and more, eventually so much that it would get stuck. The leading edge of pulse A, acting like the event horizon of a black hole, would have sucked it in.</p>
<p class="indent">Recall the discussion of Hawking radiation: pairs of particles continually appear. The two particles in a pair start out together and then move apart. After an interval of time too short to imagine, they come together again and annihilate one another. Near the event horizon of a black hole, before the pair are able to meet again and annihilate, the one with negative energy may cross the event horizon into the black hole. The particle with positive energy might fall into the black hole, too, of course, but it doesn’t have to. It’s free of the partnership. It can escape as Hawking radiation. To an observer at a distance it appears to come out of the black hole. In fact, it <span id="page410">comes</span> from just outside. Meanwhile, its partner has carried negative energy into the black hole.</p>
<p class="indent">Faccio and his team watched just such particles – photons in this case – to see whether, as the pulse passed through the glass, its event horizon would sweep in one of a pair, allowing the other to escape as Hawking radiation. They set up a camera, focused it on the block of glass, and then fired 3,600 pulses from the laser. The camera recorded a faint glow in exactly the range of frequencies that Hawking radiation predicts. Carefully ruling out other sources of the glow, the researchers decided that they had in fact observed Hawking radiation.</p>
<p class="indent">Might <em class="calibre1">this</em> get Hawking a Nobel Prize, which is very seldom given for even the most promising theories if there is no experimental or observational evidence to support them? In November 2010, not long after the announcement of the experiment in Insubria, I asked Hawking whether he thought Faccio and his team had actually discovered Hawking radiation. His reply was enigmatic: ‘I will not get the Nobel Prize.’</p>

W. Hawking and Thomas Hertog, ‘Eternal Inflation without Metaphysics’).</p>
