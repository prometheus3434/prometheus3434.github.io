<p class="chaptitle">‘Grandad has wheels’</p>
<p class="noindent"><span><span class="small">THE BBC DEBUTED</span></span> the Television film <em class="calibre1">Hawking</em> in April 2004, when Hawking had recently emerged from hospital and was preparing to do battle on the information paradox issue. This was not a full biography but a moving dramatization of two crucial years in Hawking’s life when he learned he had ALS, met Jane Wilde, and worked on singularity theorems for his thesis. A 2002 documentary, <em class="calibre1">Stephen Hawking: Profile</em>, was re-aired with the film. There were an estimated 4 million viewers.</p>
<p class="indent">Hawking helped with the final script, and Benedict Cumberbatch, who played young Stephen Hawking, took the trouble to study carefully the early stages of ALS. Jane, on whose autobiography the film was partially based, watched the video at first in bits and could find little to fault. ‘[Cumberbatch] was uncanny. He worked so hard in researching the exact progression of motor neurone disease. It brought back that period so very strongly. I <span id="page366">think</span> the young lady playing me, however, was much more feisty than ever I was. I was always extremely determined but I was also quite timid. So in that sense many of the things that appear in the film are not quite historically accurate.’ However, Jane felt that the film was true to the spirit of those years. ‘I can remember vividly the euphoric sense we had about us, that we were doing something exceptional … that, despite it all, everything was going to be possible.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch18ref1" id="rch18ref1">1</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">At about the same time the film was aired, the disturbing reports and statements having to do with abuse were finally locked away in the Cambridge police files.</p>
<p class="indent">Hawking was not doing any less well in popularity polls. In a 2004 survey of role models that polled five hundred sixteen- to eighteen-year-old English boys, he came in second to rugby star Jonny Wilkinson, edged out again by a sports celebrity, as he had been in Japan. But Hawking was not slowing down as a world traveller and lecturer. His diary in 2005 read: January: Caltech and the University of California-Santa Barbara; February: Washington, DC, and Oxford; March: Spain; June: Hong Kong; October: Germany; November: California again and then Seattle, Washington.</p>
<p class="indent">During the January visit to Caltech, Hawking suggested that this time he give a lecture solely for undergraduates. The subject would be his life in physics. The title borrowed the famous <em class="calibre1">Star Trek</em> split infinitive: ‘To Boldly Go’.</p>
<p class="indent">The trip to Washington, DC, in February, with his wife Elaine, was for the purpose of receiving the James Smithson Bicentennial Medal. The Smithsonian Institution arranged, with help from Jim Hartle, to <span id="page367">present</span> a retrospective of Hawking’s life: ‘Stephen Hawking’s Alternate Universe’. Hartle introduced his old friend in glowing terms: ‘Stephen Hawking’s work has been characterized by great mathematical precision and extraordinary physical inventiveness. He is almost always surprising.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch18ref2" id="rch18ref2">2</a></sup> Hartle quoted Hawking’s words about the career path he had followed: ‘You might think I had a grand premeditated design to address the outstanding problems concerning the origin and evolution of the universe. But it was not really like that. I did not have a master plan. Rather I followed my nose and did whatever looked interesting and possible at the time.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch18ref3" id="rch18ref3">3</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Hawking returned on this occasion to the possibility of extraterrestrial intelligent life, and his lecture was introduced by music that was clearly meant to resemble the sound track of <em class="calibre1">Star Wars</em>. ‘By intelligent life, I don’t mean only the DNA-based humanoid life like you see on <em class="calibre1">Star Trek</em>,’ he said, ‘which all is remarkably like ourselves. The range of possible life forms in the universe is much wider and includes electronic systems like computers.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch18ref4" id="rch18ref4">4</a></sup> He criticized the <em class="calibre1">Star Trek</em> image of alien civilizations as too static. Even though the suggestion was that their science and technology are more advanced than ours at present, some of the alien beings are pictured as having attained a stable state near perfection, with no further progress or evolution expected. ‘I don’t believe the <em class="calibre1">Star Trek</em> picture. We will never reach a final steady state, the end of development. Instead we shall continue to change at an ever-increasing rate.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch18ref5" id="rch18ref5">5</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">The Oxford visit was to deliver the third lecture in a series honouring his old mentor, Dennis Sciama. In Oviedo, Spain, he helped to celebrate the twenty-fifth <span id="page368">anniversary</span> of the Prince of Asturias awards, which are major global awards for scientific, technical, cultural, social and humanitarian work done at an international level.</p>
<p class="indent">All this travel and activity would seem enough to exhaust the fittest of men. For Hawking, even after passing his sixtieth birthday, it was apparently exhilarating, and, despite all the moving about, Hawking’s work as a popular author continued. October 2005 saw the publication of another version of his first bestseller, this one titled <em class="calibre1">A Briefer History of Time</em> and co-authored with physicist Leonard Mlodinow. It was indeed briefer, beautifully illustrated and simpler, and brought the physics up to date. Also that year he began work compiling a collection of historical mathematical works with short biographies of important mathematicians, to be published in 2006. It would be titled <em class="calibre1">God Created the Integers</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">Here and there, as Hawking lectured and met the media, he went on making provocative comments that had little or nothing to do with cosmology. His low opinion of politicians was increasingly evident. At an antiwar rally in Trafalgar Square in November 2004, he called the USA invasion of Iraq in March 2003 a ‘warcrime’.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch18ref6" id="rch18ref6">6</a></sup> In 2005, when George W. Bush suggested returning astronauts to the moon, Hawking commented that ‘sending politicians would be much cheaper, because you don’t have to bring them back’.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch18ref7" id="rch18ref7">7</a></sup> He admonished those who opposed stem cell research: ‘The fact that the cells may come from embryos is not an objection because the embryos are going to die anyway. It is morally equivalent to taking a heart transplant from a victim of a car accident.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch18ref8" id="rch18ref8">8</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent" id="page369">In May 2005 he lightened up – <em class="calibre1">The Simpsons</em> again. This time, an episode titled ‘Don’t Fear the Roofer’ had the ‘Hawking’ character announcing that he was now a Springfield resident. He had purchased the pizza parlor. He tried to get his computer to say the company motto but his computer got stuck and kept saying ‘pizza pizza’. ‘Hawking’ had to hit his computer to make it behave, something he cannot do in real life. Later in the story, ‘Hawking’ saved Homer’s sanity (if that is not an oxymoron) by explaining that it was a tear in spacetime and a little black hole, resulting in gravitational lensing, that caused Homer to be the only one able to see one of the other characters in Builder’s Barn. Hawking also made a television appearance that year in the docudrama <em class="calibre1">Alien Planet</em>, as an expert consultant.</p>
<p class="indent">On 22 August 2005, the long-awaited paper that Hawking had been promising would lay out clearly and in detail his solution to the information paradox finally went to <em class="calibre1">Physical Review</em>, who published it in their 18 October edition. The paper was only three and a half pages long, with only three equations. Hawking utilized Feynman’s sums-over-histories, applying them, as he had before, to the universe. In developing his no-boundary proposal with James Hartle, Hawking had studied different histories the universe could have had, and calculated which were more probable than others. Now he was likewise asking his readers to imagine all alternative histories of universes. Some would have black holes and some would not. Information would be lost in those histories with black holes, but not in those without black holes. His solution depended on the fact that the universe histories where black holes exist would be cancelled out by those <span id="page370">where</span> they do not, the upshot being that information wouldn’t disappear because there would be no black holes for it to become trapped in in the first place. If you waited long enough, only those histories without black holes would be significant. Information, in the end, would be preserved.</p>
<p class="indent">Given Hawking’s two explanations, and an earlier firm rejection of the idea that the information would be returned via Hawking radiation, it is a surprise to find that not long after he published this paper, in one of the children’s books he wrote with his daughter Lucy – <em class="calibre1">George’s Secret Key to the Universe</em><sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch18ref9" id="rch18ref9">9</a></sup> – with Christophe Galfard’s name also on the title page, he used a completely different solution to the problem, a solution that <em class="calibre1">did</em> involve Hawking radiation. It is also intriguing to discover that his top-down approach, which we will discuss a little later, is not easy to reconcile with his 2005 solution. Many of Hawking’s colleagues remained unconvinced, wondering why he preferred his solution to Leonard Susskind’s and Maldacena’s. Perhaps the reason was that, having introduced the problem in the first place, he felt that he should be the one to solve it.</p>
<p class="indent">Hawking and Galfard explained the delay of the paper on the grounds of Hawking’s increasing difficulty with his hand-held clicker device. In that regard, 2005 was a dispiriting year. The speed at which he could communicate had been slowing down since 2000 until finally his hands were too weak to use the clicker. He exchanged it for a switching device attached to his glasses, developed by Words+ (the Infrared/Sound/Touch (IST) switch). The low-power infrared beam can be controlled by the blink of an eye or by moving a cheek muscle. As <span id="page371">of</span> 2011, Hawking controls his with his cheek muscle.</p>
<p class="indent">The 2005 travel schedule did not end as planned. His schedule may have read Seattle, but he didn’t get there. He was to travel to Seattle from Oakland, California, but while he was being taken off his respirator in the morning shortly before departing from Oakland, something went wrong and Hawking ‘basically flat-lined. They had to resuscitate him, and that panicked a few people. But he’s been there before.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch18ref10" id="rch18ref10">10</a></sup> Hawking stayed in Oakland and delivered the Seattle address by live telecast.</p>
<p class="indent">Undaunted by that glitch, Hawking in 2006 scheduled travel to France, Spain, China and Israel. It was not his first time in Israel. He and Jane had been there to accept the Wolf Prize in 1988. But this time he refused to accept the invitation unless he could spend part of his visit with and lecture to Palestinians. That was arranged. In Israel he added a new quip to his long list, commenting that the lack of anonymity when travelling was a down side to celebrity and worse for him than for others: ‘It is not enough for me to wear dark sunglasses and a wig. The wheelchair gives me away.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch18ref11" id="rch18ref11">11</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">The prestigious Copley Medal that he received from the Royal Society in November had travelled even further than its recipient. The Royal Society arranged for British astronaut Piers Sellers to fly it into space before presenting it to Hawking.</p>
<p class="indent">Hawking’s marriage to Elaine ended in divorce in the summer of 2006. Hawking refrained from comment and his personal assistant, Judith Croasdell, brushed off reporters clamouring for a statement with the words ‘He is far too busy. This is just a distraction which is really annoying. We don’t have any time for any of this … We <span id="page372">have</span> no interest in any of the gossip that is going on.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch18ref12" id="rch18ref12">12</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">While observations by WMAP continued and theorists looked forward to results that would help them understand inflation theory and settle other questions, they didn’t stop in their tracks to wait. There were new models of inflation that went beyond the familiar four dimensions of our universe. In 2000, Hawking had mentioned the possible role of p-branes in inflation. Alan Guth, the founding father of inflation theory, was also studying the possibility of inflation in ‘brane world’ models. Natalia Shuhmaher and Robert Brandenberger of McGill University in Montreal came up with a model in 2006 in which it was a hot gas of branes that drove inflation. Their model had all the spatial dimensions starting out extremely compact, with the extra dimensions beyond our familiar three tucked together in what is called an ‘orbifold’. In the very early universe, the brane gas expanded and its energy density decreased until the three familiar spatial dimensions experienced an inflationary period.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch18ref13" id="rch18ref13">13</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Hawking stayed on in the large, comfortable house that he and his second wife had built together. For the first time since the beginning of his first marriage, he was living on his own, though of course still with nurses in attendance. He had resumed close contact with Jane and their children and grandchildren, relationships that had suffered over the past decade and a half, especially during the unpleasant period of the abuse issues when he had declined to honour their concerns. All seemed to have chosen to put behind them that difficult-to-understand chapter in their lives.</p>
<p class="h" id="page373">Fat and Lean Years at the Trough</p>
<p class="noindent">Although string theorist Brian Greene would tell a Cambridge lecture audience in 2011 that string theorists were ‘happy as pigs in shit’, it had not always been like that. In the years leading up to his remark, beginning in the previous century, the pigsty had not always looked so appealing. As early as 1986, it had become clear to string theorists that the number of different ways the extra dimensions could curl up was distressingly enormous,<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch18ref14" id="rch18ref14">14</a></sup> and this was considered a serious shortcoming of string theory. However, that same year Andrei Linde cheered up his fellow theorists by insisting, in his first paper about eternal inflation, that this multiplicity of types of compactification (curling up) ‘should be considered not as a difficulty but as a virtue of these theories, since it increases the probability of the existence of mini-universes in which life of our type may appear.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch18ref15" id="rch18ref15">15</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">A happy moment came in 1997 when Maldacena, then at Harvard, introduced an idea known as ADS–CFT<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#FT1pg373" id="rFT1pg373">fn1</a></sup> duality that suggested a link between conventional quantum field theory and a certain type of string theory. Recall that dualities are situations where two very different theories (sometimes seemingly contradictory) both accurately describe the same thing. Maldacena’s idea was an unproved conjecture, but it promised eventually to provide a genuine mathematic basis for string theory, and for that reason it had a strong influence on string theory’s subsequent development. ‘ADS–CFT correspondence’ also had significant implications for the relationship between string theory and brane worlds,<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch18ref16" id="rch18ref16">16</a></sup> and Hawking thought the idea had something to offer with regard to the information paradox, weighing in on the side of no loss of information.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch18ref17" id="rch18ref17">17</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent" id="page374">Then, another downer. In 2000, Joe Polchinski at the University of California-Santa Barbara and Raphael Bousso at the University of California-Berkeley found that the basic equations of string theory had a truly astronomical number of different possible solutions, each representing a different way to describe a universe. It was a while before anyone could figure out whether any of these solutions were stable, but that was settled in 2003. There are (very roughly) 10<sup class="calibre3">500</sup> of them. The problem this huge number presented was that string theory could never be proved right or wrong. Almost <em class="calibre1">any</em> experimental result would be consistent with it. As you will recall from <a href="../Text/chapter_002.html">Chapter 2</a>, this is not good news for a theory.</p>
<p class="indent">Again it was Andrei Linde who saved the day by pointing out that this was not such terrible news after all. Eternal inflation theory was, in fact, predicting just such a situation.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look first at the curling problem … or non-problem.</p>
<p class="h">Curling Becomes an Olympic Event</p>
<p class="noindent">When a new universe emerges, not all the space dimensions predicted by string theory inflate. Some remain invisible but play an important role in deciding what form the new universe takes. Theorists were finding that they are not just curled up willy-nilly. Precisely how they are curled determines the apparent laws of nature in that particular universe.</p>
<p class="indent" id="page375">In the late 1980s and early 1990s, when Hawking had been thinking about wormholes and baby universes, he had speculated that the masses of particles and other fundamental numbers in nature might not be fundamental to the totality of universes, but different for different universes. They might be ‘quantum variables’ – numbers fixed at random at the moment of creation in each universe. A throw of the dice, with no way to know from a theory how the dice would fall.</p>
<p class="indent">In M-theory, it was no longer a dice throw. As Hawking and Mlodinow would put it in <em class="calibre1">The Grand Design</em>, ‘the exact shape of the internal space determines both the values of physical constants, such as the charge of the electron, and the nature of the interactions between elementary particles’.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch18ref18" id="rch18ref18">18</a></sup> In other words, the fundamental laws of M-theory permit different laws of nature in different universes, in the way that the Constitution of the USA permits different local laws in the different states. What the local laws of nature <em class="calibre1">are</em> in a universe is determined by the way the extra dimensions are curled up.</p>
<p class="indent">Linde and his colleagues calculated the different ways the extra dimensions could curl up, each way leading to a unique universe.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch18ref19" id="rch18ref19">19</a></sup> The number is enormous beyond imagining. Curling had indeed become an Olympic sport. The prosaic word ‘multiverse’ fails dismally as the name for all this. It’s too bad John Wheeler isn’t still around to give it a better one.</p>
<p class="h">Top Down</p>
<p class="noindent">Earlier in the decade, Hawking and Turok had left the pea instanton lying on a shelf and each headed off in a different direction. Turok began to favour ‘cyclic’ models <span id="page376">where</span> the universe expands from a big bang, eventually contracts again to a big crunch, and then reemerges in another big bang, in a cycle that keeps repeating itself.</p>
<p class="indent">Hawking was more interested in models of eternal inflation. The fact that there are perhaps infinite possibilities for types of universes in this model makes it difficult, some would argue impossible, to calculate the likelihood of one kind of universe over another. Undeterred by this sticky mathematical problem, Hawking was determined to try, and in doing so he was going to utilize something that was still controversial among some of his colleagues, the anthropic principle.</p>
<p class="indent">The controversy over the use of the anthropic principle, which had come to a head when Hawking and Turok introduced their pea instanton theory, had not died away. However, Hawking’s old friend Martin J. Rees and Mario Livio had given the anthropic principle and its use added respectability when they wrote in a paper in 2005 that ‘“anthropic reasoning” not only has a role in valid speculative scientific discourse, but may in fact have predictive power for sorting out allowable cosmological scenarios’. Although ‘such arguments raise the blood pressure of many scientists … it can indeed be one of many tools in the cosmological toolkit’.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch18ref20" id="rch18ref20">20</a></sup> Hawking was preparing to treat it as a powerful tool.</p>
<p class="indent">In February 2006, he and Thomas Hertog collaborated on a paper reporting on work in which they combined the string landscape of multiple universes with the initial conditions of the no-boundary proposal. Their suggestion was that we picture the early universe as a superposition of all possible ways it could have existed in the string theory <span id="page377">landscape</span> – as you might, if you were about to draw a card from an unusually large deck, visualize all the possibilities of your draw at once. Each possibility produces a different future. We are faced with a universe that has many, many possible beginnings and many, many possible histories. As Hawking quipped in a lecture at Caltech that year, ‘There will be a history in which the moon is made of blue cheese, but the amplitude for that is low, which is bad news for mice.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch18ref21" id="rch18ref21">21</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Hawking and Hertog confined themselves to a model with a simple landscape that permitted several different inflationary histories for the universe. Should you place yourself at ‘the beginning’ and start calculating the probabilities of those universes emerging? No. In Hawking’s ‘top-down’ approach you start with the present, observing the universe as it currently exists, and then work backwards and decide how likely it is that each initial state would allow for the later existence of the populated universe we know. In this way, the present state of the universe ‘selects’ the past.</p>
<p class="indent">Hawking and Hertog studied the observational consequences of the no-boundary initial conditions and came up with a scheme to test their theory. If this is a valid way of working, there will be subtle differences in the CMBR and the gravity wave spectra from what these would be like if standard inflation theory is correct. Future technology, Hawking thought, might be able to discover these subtleties.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch18ref22" id="rch18ref22">22</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Hawking delivered his 2006 lecture at Caltech controlling his computer with his cheek muscle. Titled ‘The Origins of the Universe’, it included some of the new thinking he and Hertog had been doing. Hawking <span id="page378">would</span> describe their top-down approach more fully later in his book <em class="calibre1">The Grand Design</em>.</p>
<p class="h">Secret Keys and Cosmic Adventures</p>
<p class="noindent">When Lucy Hawking’s novel <em class="calibre1">Jaded</em> had appeared in the spring of 2004, and she’d begun a second one, <em class="calibre1">The Accidental Marathon</em>, she’d talked with many interviewers about her books. Lucy was not terribly surprised but somewhat annoyed that questions about her and her writing inevitably drifted into questions about her father.</p>
<p class="indent">Lucy’s life had taken a difficult turn. Her marriage had been shortlived, and soon after the separation her son William had been diagnosed with autism. ‘I actually felt as if my heart was breaking into tiny pieces,’ she said.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch18ref23" id="rch18ref23">23</a></sup> Her mother Jane had insisted she persevere in finding the most effective treatment possible. William, as a result, had done remarkably well. He was very proud of his grandfather, not so much because of his physics accomplishments, but because ‘grandad has wheels’. And Hawking returned the compliment. His office was full of William’s pictures, and he even included one photo in <em class="calibre1">The Universe in a Nutshell</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">Lucy’s response when the interviewers proved more interested in her father than in her was a practical one. She decided, if you can’t beat ’em, join ’em. She would collaborate on a book with him.</p>
<p class="indent">In June 2006, Lucy accompanied her father on a trip to Hong Kong and Beijing, where the welcome was even more riotous than usual. When they appeared from their plane, police had to form a body chain to make a human corridor, holding back the crowds, so that they could reach the lift and get away to their hotel. Even with all that effort to protect him, Hawking came near to being <span id="page379">pushed</span> over. He was unflappable. He wanted to be photographed with this ‘rugby scrum’ of excited students, but the front-page newspaper photos captured only him and the rather desperate-looking policemen, until things settled down enough for a picture with a well-behaved group of small school children, unfurling a welcoming banner larger than they were. Two physics undergraduates from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, where Hawking was scheduled to lecture, had the honour of presenting him with flowers. Paul Chu Ching-wu, the university’s president, commented, ‘He’s one of the most famous scientists ever. If you could say that Isaac Newton changed the world, then Stephen Hawking has changed the universe.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch18ref24" id="rch18ref24">24</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Stephen and Lucy Hawking took the opportunity of this well-publicized trip to announce that they would be co-authoring a children’s book. <em class="calibre1">George’s Secret Key to the Universe</em> was the first of their books together. It featured not only the space adventures of its young hero George and his next-door neighbours, the scientist Eric and his daughter Annie, and Cosmos, a supercomputer, but also some of the other issues that concerned Hawking. Confronted with the pollution in Chinese cities, he had expressed his worry that Earth might ‘end up like Venus, at 250 degrees centigrade and raining sulphuric acid’.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch18ref25" id="rch18ref25">25</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">In the ‘George’ books, Lucy actually did give people like the interviewers who had annoyed her something of what they had been hoping for. <em class="calibre1">George’s Key to the Universe</em> and <em class="calibre1">George’s Cosmic Treasure Hunt</em>,<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch18ref26" id="rch18ref26">26</a></sup> the first two in what we may hope will be a series, are delightful and instructive, and also offer an insight into the personalities and lives of Hawking and his family. The physicist Eric is <span id="page380">unmistakably</span> Hawking, imagined without his disability. His passion for physics and insistence on sharing it, his insatiable curiosity, his single-minded devotion to his work, his love of children – all are there. I am told that the wonderful, redoubtable character, George’s grandmother Mabel, with her selective deafness, is recognizably a portrait of Hawking’s mother Isobel. When George finds himself at a high-level physics conference and dares to raise his hand and ask a question, it is a retelling of a Hawking family story: when Robert, Lucy’s older brother, was eight years old, he went with his father to a conference of theoretical physicists. He took a seat in the front row and listened intently, nodding his head, then raised his hand to ask an intelligent question. The description of the thoughtful, serious way the physicists in the book treat George’s question is a tribute to Hawking’s real-life colleagues. The science in the books is Hawking’s science: black holes, Hawking radiation, the information paradox, the search for another planet for humans to colonize.</p>
<p class="indent">Lucy told interviewers that there were several reasons for writing the ‘George’ books. Her own son was ten years old, and she had a nephew as well, Robert’s and his wife Katrina’s son George. <em class="calibre1">George’s Secret Key to the Universe</em> was dedicated to him and William. Lucy wanted to create, with her father, a book that would explain for these children some of the work he had done. She had noticed the interest when children and their parents had gathered around her father at William’s birthday parties, amazed that he was willing to answer their questions and explain his science to them. She had watched him take the time and trouble to give them good, thoughtful, informative answers <span id="page381">and</span> also make them laugh. Hawking pointed out that as children most of us start out filled with curiosity and wonder. Anything is possible. That hasn’t changed for him. That’s still the way he feels, and he and Lucy want to encourage that feeling in their young readers.</p>
<p class="indent">Working with her father on the book gave Lucy a chance to see what her father was like at work in his own field, and that, she said, altered their relationship. Though she doesn’t think he has changed much – possibly mellowed – she had never had the opportunity to see this side of him. ‘He has the amazing ability to hold enormous amounts of information in his head, but also to pick out relevant details and make brief comments, which can completely transform your way of thinking.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch18ref27" id="rch18ref27">27</a></sup> She was awed by how quick and clear-minded he is, and the knack he has for putting things together and having them fit.</p>
<p class="indent">In November 2006 Hawking was once again stressing, in a BBC radio interview, that the future of the human race depends on our colonizing another planet, not in our solar system but orbiting another star.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch18ref28" id="rch18ref28">28</a></sup> He had hopes of going into space himself. A month earlier Hawking had mentioned in an interview that his next goal was to go on a space flight and ‘Maybe Richard Branson will help me’ – which Branson wasted no time before offering to do. There would be a place for him in 2010 on Branson’s sub-orbital space flight venture Virgin Galactic. Paris Hilton and William Shatner would go along. Hawking didn’t expect Branson to get him to another habitable planet, but was sure the future could hold such journeys, and the fictional characters in his and Lucy’s books followed up on just that suggestion.</p>
<p class="indent" id="page382">Later in 2006, twenty-five thousand people responded in a blog with answers to Hawking’s question, ‘In a world that is in chaos politically, socially and environmentally, how can the human race sustain another 100 years?’ No wonder he was thinking his ideas might actually influence public policy! In his posted follow-up to the blog, he mentioned genetic engineering, this time not as something perhaps undesirable that was going to happen anyway, but with the utopian hope that it might make human beings ‘wise and less aggressive’.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch18ref29" id="rch18ref29">29</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent-bs">On the trip to China with Lucy, Hawking had once again joked about Pope John Paul II’s forbidding scientists to study the origin of the universe, and said he was glad the Pope was unaware of the topic of his talk because he ‘didn’t fancy the thought of being handed over to the Inquisition like Galileo’. The Vatican itself seemed able to overlook comments like that, but Catholic lay leaders had heard the misquotation and flippant remark once too often. In a heated response, Catholic League president Bill Donohue said that Hawking ‘should stop distorting the words of the pope’: ‘There is a monumental difference between saying that there are certain questions that science cannot answer – which is what the pope said – and authoritarian pronouncements warning scientists to back off.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch18ref30" id="rch18ref30">30</a></sup> The Pope’s statement had, as we have seen, not been an inaccurate description of the state of scientific knowledge at the time he made it, and there was no threat to make anyone fear Galileo’s fate. His words were:</p>
<p class="quote-jy-bs">Every scientific hypothesis about the origin of the world … leaves unanswered the problem concerning the beginning of the universe. By itself science cannot resolve <span id="page383">such</span> a question: it requires human knowledge which rises above the physical, the astrophysical, what we call the metaphysical; what is required above all is the knowledge which comes from the revelation of God.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch18ref31" id="rch18ref31">31</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Hawking took Catholic League president Bill Donohue’s words to heart. On his visits to the Vatican as a member of the Pontifical Academy, he has not mentioned the incident or Galileo again. Pope John Paul II had acknowledged in a speech in 1992 that the Roman Catholic Church had erred in condemning Galileo, an acknowledgement Hawking had said he hoped would eventually be made, when he visited the Vatican in 1973. It <em class="calibre1">was</em> time to bury the hatchet.</p>
<p class="h">Zero Gravity</p>
<p class="noindent">In April 2007, Hawking undertook an adventure that he hoped would be the first step on the road to a real space flight. This was a flight that offers passengers the experience of weightlessness, zero gravity. No one was certain how his frail body would react. No problem! Hawking took eight turns of weightlessness, four minutes in all, more than anyone had expected, except, perhaps, himself. ‘I could have gone on and on!’ he said.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch18ref32" id="rch18ref32">32</a></sup> Four physicians and two nurses, who monitored Hawking’s blood pressure, cardiac readings and blood oxygen levels throughout the flight, agreed.</p>
<p class="indent">A company called ‘Zero Gravity’ provides these flights. Here’s how it works: The plane follows a parabolic, rollercoaster path. As the plane climbs, passengers feel almost twice the pull of gravity they normally feel on Earth. Near the top of the parabola, they feel they are in free-fall for <span id="page384">about</span> twenty-five seconds. The course is then repeated, in Hawking’s case eight times.</p>
<p class="indent-bs">Hawking had a second motive for taking this flight, and, he hopes, his upcoming space flight – spreading his conviction that colonizing other planets is the only hope for an extended future for us.</p>
<p class="quote-jy-bs">It will be difficult enough to avoid disaster on planet earth in the next 100 years, let alone the next 1000 or million. The human race shouldn’t have all its eggs in one basket or on one planet. Getting a portion of the human race permanently off the planet is imperative for our future as a species.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch18ref33" id="rch18ref33">33</a></sup></p>
<p class="noindent">There is, he insisted, a huge future mass market for space-oriented services in tourism. ‘We need to engage the entrepreneurial engine that has reduced the cost of everything from airline tickets to personal computers.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch18ref34" id="rch18ref34">34</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Hawking’s third motive for taking the flight was to encourage other disabled people to get out and try things like this. If he can do it, so can others. While that may not be true when it comes to theorizing about the origin of the universe, when it comes to adventures like weightlessness, why not? The answer that most immediately comes to mind is, of course, the price.</p>
<p class="h">Itinerant physicist</p>
<p class="noindent">2008 was a phenomenally busy year of travel for Hawking, and even more so for his valiant personal assistant, Judith Croasdell, whose task it was to make preparatory journeys to reconnoitre, plan the visits with his hosts, and make all the necessary on-the-spot <span id="page385">arrangements</span>. She had been told when she was hired that ‘the personal assistant does not travel’. That may have been true for other PAs, but not for Judith.</p>
<p class="indent">In January the destination was Chile; the occasion a scientific meeting in Valdivia to celebrate the sixtieth birthday of Chile’s most distinguished physicist, the charismatic Claudio Bunster. Bunster had been responsible for Hawking’s visit to Chile and Antarctica ten years earlier. From Chile, braving the difficulty of taking Hawking in his wheelchair to a remote part of the world with dauntingly uneven terrain where disabled access was only just beginning to be considered an important addition, his entourage flew with him to Easter Island. For Judith Croasdell, who had lived in the Southern Hemisphere in the Pacific islands herself for many years and been a student of Pacific history, this trip was ‘the Holy Grail’.</p>
<p class="indent">In May it was South Africa. In Cape Town, Hawking visited the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS), an institute for postgraduate study that draws top students from all over Africa and supports the development of mathematics and science across the continent. Hawking’s friend and colleague Neil Turok, the founder of AIMS, helped organize that trip. Hawking met Nelson Mandela and launched the Next Einstein Initiative, a programme at AIMS that Hawking said, in his lecture, he hoped would nurture ‘An African Einstein’.</p>
<p class="indent">In September, hosted by the University of Santiago de Compostela, Hawking touched down in that famous, beautiful Spanish pilgrimage city, to receive the Fonseca Prize, an award that celebrates outstanding individuals in the communication of science to the general public. <span id="page386">Judith</span> Croasdell remembers that ‘it was a tough trip, with high expectations and a huge press conference. The press conference was far too long, the press asked far too many questions (over forty questions for Stephen to choose from). Stephen answered about fourteen – which was a lot.’ Lucy accompanied him on this journey, to publicize the Spanish edition of <em class="calibre1">George’s Secret Key to the Universe</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">With far-flung travels evidently on his mind that year, in his lecture at Caltech Hawking was a little less pessimistic about the possibility of travelling through a wormhole to another universe. He pointed to a new possibility, black holes in the extra dimensions of space-time. Light wouldn’t propagate through the extra dimensions, only through our familiar four, but gravity would affect them and be much stronger than what we experience. That would make it easier for a little black hole to form in the extra dimensions.</p>
<p class="indent">In this lecture, while giving background about black holes in general, he described Hawking radiation in a different way. He wasn’t reneging on the version involving particle pairs, it was just an alternative way of thinking about it. If a particle is in a very small black hole, you know with fair accuracy where it is. Because of the uncertainty principle, the more certain you are about its position, the less certain you are going to be about its speed. So the smaller the black hole the more uncertainty about a particle’s speed. It could even be more than the speed of light, and that would allow the particle to escape from the black hole. In this description, Hawking radiation <em class="calibre1">does</em> come from inside the black hole.</p>
<p class="indent">Could you possibly fall into a black hole and come out in another universe? He thought that might be possible. <span id="page387">He</span> had not given up on the idea of wormholes. But you couldn’t come back again, so he, personally, is not going to try it, in spite of being one of the most intrepid and eager-to-travel people in the world.</p>
