<p class="noindent"><span><span class="small">BACK IN CAMBRIDGE</span></span> after their sojourn in california, the Hawkings settled into their new home in West Road.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch8ref1" id="rch8ref1">1</a></sup> For Stephen, after a year in an electric wheelchair that could move fast and be used both indoors and out, there was no going back to an old-fashioned model. His request to the UK Department of Health for a chair like the one he’d had in California was rejected. The Hawkings drained their savings to purchase it themselves.</p>
<p class="indent">In this new vehicle, the daily journey to the DAMTP in Silver Street took about ten minutes, not by the shortest route but by a more pleasant and less-trafficked one. He followed a curving tree-lined footpath through King’s College that took him across the ‘Backs’ past <span id="page153">meadows</span> with grazing cows and immaculately mown lawns, crossing the River Cam by a hump-backed stone bridge behind King’s College Chapel. From there he had a choice. He could use a side entrance from King’s and, by way of a not heavily used back street called Queens’ Lane, pass in the shadow of the towering medieval gates of Queens’ College to arrive at Silver Street. Or he could exit King’s by its main front gate into busy King’s Parade, and then turn right to reach Silver Street. Either way, the hazardous crossing of this narrow, busy thoroughfare provided a modicum of risk and excitement to climax an otherwise peaceful journey. Around the back of his building was his ramp. He would time his arrival for about 11 a.m. Hawking’s new graduate student assistant, Alan Lapades, sometimes made the journey with him, but often Hawking went on his own, the state-of-the-art wheelchair giving him optimum independence.</p>
<p class="indent">By the autumn of 1975, Hawking had completed the six years of his Caius Fellowship for Distinction in Science. Though he couldn’t lecture, he was a very good mentor, willing to spend so much time in discussion with his students that some colleagues wondered how he ever got his own work done. The University of Cambridge put an end to rumours circulating that he might emigrate permanently to the USA by offering him a ‘readership’ and also a secretary, Judy Fella. Judy was a vivacious and rather glamorous addition to the DAMTP and a godsend to both Stephen and Jane. His having his own secretary relieved Jane of the burden of doing all Hawking’s scheduling and travel bookings. Jane turned once again to her neglected thesis and, following up on her new musical interest, began voice lessons.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch8ref2" id="rch8ref2">2</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent" id="page154">In the summer of 1975, BBC television lorries lumbered into the Hawkings’ West Road forecourt and snaked cables into the house to film Stephen for a documentary, <em class="calibre1">The Key to the Universe</em>, moving to Silver Street to film a seminar in the DAMTP. Media invasions such as this, which would happen many times in the future, ran roughshod over other interests and priorities of colleagues, students, staff and family. Over the years it would become an annoyance, but the first few times it was very exciting.</p>
<p class="indent">Jane’s plan of having live-in student assistants was working well. Hawking was eager for Don Page, whom he had met at Caltech, to come to fill that position. Page, who was finishing his Ph.D. and applying for postdoc posts, was a close friend and an extremely promising physics colleague. When Gary Gibbons was invited to Munich for a year, that freed funds to hire Page as Research Assistant. Later, a NATO fellowship would pay him. In autumn 1976, this unusually tall young man with a powerfully resonant speaking voice joined the West Road household.</p>
<p class="indent">For Hawking, an agnostic bordering on atheism, Don was an unexpected choice – intellectually brilliant, scrupulously moral, devoutly and outspokenly religious. He would not stick to physics topics on journeys to and from Silver Street but often veered off into discussions of what he had read in the Bible that morning. Stephen parried with friendly sceptical banter but respected Don’s opinions and faith. Don would remain a personal friend and a highly valued academic collaborator long after his student assistantship was over.</p>
<p class="indent">With Judy Fella at the office and Don Page at home, some of the responsibility for Stephen was off Jane <span id="page155">Hawking’s</span> shoulders. For the first time in many years, Stephen travelled without her, in the summer of 1977, when Page accompanied him on a revisit to Caltech lasting several weeks.</p>
<p class="indent">It was about this time that Hawking and other younger Fellows were invited to come to London for Prince Charles’s induction into the Royal Society. The prince was intrigued by Hawking’s wheelchair, and Hawking, twirling it around to demonstrate its capabilities, carelessly ran over Prince Charles’s toes. Soon rumour had it that running over toes was not always accidental, and eventually it would get around that one of Hawking’s regrets in life was not having an opportunity to run over Margaret Thatcher’s toes. People who annoyed him, it was said, found themselves a target. ‘A malicious rumour,’ insists Hawking. ‘I’ll run over anyone who repeats it.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch8ref3" id="rch8ref3">3</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">In the autumn of 1977, just two years after his ‘readership’ began, the University of Cambridge promoted Hawking to a chair in gravitational physics, with a welcome rise in salary. He was now a ‘professor’, a distinction much more rarely achieved at Cambridge and most English universities than in an American one.</p>
<p class="indent">It was that December of 1977, when Jane joined the choir of St Mark’s Church in Barton Road for the Christmas season of special music, that she first met a young man named Jonathan Hellyer Jones, who was the organist there. Jonathan was a gifted musician, younger than Jane and Stephen by a few years. He had recently lost his wife to leukaemia after only one year of marriage. The Hawking home became a haven for him. Both Jane and Stephen were emotional supports, but Jonathan also more than pulled his own weight in the household – sitting at <span id="page156">the</span> piano teaching seven-year-old Lucy, and volunteering to help with Stephen’s physical needs. Jane joined the St Mark’s congregation. She also was at last able to find the time to begin working seriously on the final chapter of her thesis.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch8ref4" id="rch8ref4">4</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Perhaps it was inevitable that this young man, intimately and generously involved with the family, a godsend to Jane as she struggled to keep up with her tasks as caregiver, homemaker, Ph.D. student and mother, and sharing her faith and her love of music, would become more than a helpful supportive friend. Jane, with characteristic honesty, did not keep it a secret from Stephen when she and Jonathan developed a romantic attachment. Hawking apparently accepted this, saying nothing except that, as Jane has written, ‘he would not object so long as I continued to love him’.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch8ref5" id="rch8ref5">5</a></sup> After that, the subject was rarely mentioned between them, and Jane’s relationship with Jonathan remained platonic for a long time. They chose ‘to maintain our code of conduct in front of Stephen and the children, suppressing displays of close affection’. They did not move out to live together. ‘Jonathan and I had struggled with our own consciences and decided that the greater good – the survival of the family unit, Stephen’s right to live at home within that family unit and welfare of the children – outweighed the importance of our relationship.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch8ref6" id="rch8ref6">6</a></sup> Their secret was so well guarded that only a small circle of family and friends were aware of that relationship, and whatever grief Jane and Jonathan may, or may not, have caused him, Hawking kept that to himself.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch8ref7" id="rch8ref7">7</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">In the autumn of 1978 Jane was pregnant again. With not only Don Page and Judy Fella but also Jonathan on <span id="page157">board</span>, she decided to set herself a deadline for finishing her thesis before the baby was born in the spring. It was now or never. In the winter she set that work aside only briefly to organize a charity concert to raise funds for the newly formed Motor Neurone Disease Association. Stephen was a patron. Jane was beginning to be a presence in the music world of Cambridge.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch8ref8" id="rch8ref8">8</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">The Hawkings’ third child, Timothy, was born in April on Easter Sunday. To commemorate another birthday a hundred years before, Hawking and Werner Israel celebrated the anniversary of the birth of Albert Einstein (14 March 1879) by inviting colleagues to contribute articles to a book reflecting current research related to general relativity. The introduction foreshadowed the topic of Hawking’s Inaugural Lecture as Lucasian Professor, commenting on ‘Einstein’s dream of a complete and consistent theory that would unify all the laws of physics’.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch8ref9" id="rch8ref9">9</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Hawking received several major international awards and honorary doctorates in the mid- to late 1970s, including the Hughes Medal from the Royal Society honouring ‘an original discovery in the physical sciences’ for ‘distinguished contributions to the application of general relativity to astrophysics’, and, in 1978, the coveted Albert Einstein Award from the Lewis and Rosa Strauss Memorial Fund in the United States. That award is not given every year and is the most prestigious American award for a physicist. One of the honorary doctorates, in the summer of 1978, was from his alma mater, Oxford. Most significant of all for Hawking’s future, in the autumn of 1979 the University of Cambridge gave him the venerable title of Lucasian Professor of Mathematics. He at last <span id="page158">got</span> a private office. The impressive tome in which each new university teaching officer inscribes his or her name was brought to him there more than a year later. Somehow, this formality had been neglected earlier. ‘I signed with great difficulty. That was the last time I signed my name.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch8ref10" id="rch8ref10">10</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">In 1980, Hawking’s battle for independence reached a crisis point. Martin Rees was by then the holder of another prestigious chair at Cambridge, the Plumian Professorship of Astronomy. He had known the Hawkings since before their marriage and had witnessed at close hand both Stephen’s soaring success as a scientist and his inexorable physical decline. Some time in the late winter or early spring Rees asked Jane to come in for a chat with him at the Institute of Physics. Earlier that winter, when a bad cold had turned more serious and Jane had also been ill and slow to mend, Stephen, on the family doctor’s recommendation, had entered a nursing home for a short while until they both recovered. Rees feared that this would be the first of many times when the Hawkings would not be able to cope without additional help. He offered to find funding to pay for limited home nursing.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch8ref11" id="rch8ref11">11</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">To Hawking, this was unthinkable. Agreeing to it would be giving in to his illness and would introduce an unwelcome, impersonal intrusion into his life. He would become a patient. After some consideration, however, he changed his mind. There would be advantages. He would be much freer to travel, not always having to depend on his wife, friends and students. What he had at first seen as a loss of independence might be a gain instead.</p>
<p class="h" id="page159">N=8 Supergravity</p>
<p class="noindent">Hawking’s Inaugural Lucasian Lecture, ‘Is the End in Sight for Theoretical Physics?’, with which this book began, took place on 29 April 1980. In that lecture he chose N=8 supergravity as the front-running candidate for the Theory of Everything. It was not one of his own theories, but it seemed to him and many other physicists extremely promising. Supergravity grew out of the idea of supersymmetry, a theory that suggested that all the particles we know have supersymmetric partners, particles with the same mass but different ‘spin’.</p>
<p class="indent">In <em class="calibre1">A Brief History of Time</em>, Hawking suggests it’s best to think of spin as meaning what a particle looks like when you rotate it. A particle with spin 0 is like a dot. It looks the same no matter from what direction you look at it and no matter how you turn it. A particle with spin 1 is like an arrow: you have to turn it around a full rotation (360 degrees) to have it look the same as when you started. A particle with spin 2 is like an arrow with two heads (one at each end of the shaft): it will look the same if you turn it only half a rotation (180 degrees). All seems fairly straightforward so far, but now we come to something slightly more bizarre, particles with spin ½. These have to complete two rotations in order to return to their original configuration.</p>
<p class="indent">We saw in <a href="../Text/chapter_002.html">Chapter 2</a> that every particle we know in the universe is either a fermion (particles that make up matter) or a boson (a ‘messenger’ particle). Elementary fermions have spin ½. An electron, for example, has to finish two rotations in order to return to its original configuration. Bosons, on the other hand, all have whole number spins. The photon, W and Z bosons, and the <span id="page160">gluon</span> have spin 1, returning to their original configuration after one rotation (the single-headed arrow). The graviton theoretically has spin 2 (the double-headed arrow), returning to its original configuration after half a rotation.</p>
<p class="indent">Supersymmetry theory suggests a unification of matter and the forces of nature by proposing ‘supersymmetric partners’ for each of these particles, with every fermion having a boson for a partner, and every boson a fermion – a little like the procession at the end of an old-fashioned wedding uniting two formerly incompatible families, with every bridesmaid going out on the arm of a groom’s attendant from the other clan. There was a Latin flavour to the naming of the bosons’ partners. The photon’s theoretical supersymmetric partner was christened the photino. The graviton’s was named the gravitino. As for the fermions, their supersymmetric partners were all given names by adding an s. And so we have the selectron and the squark.</p>
<p class="indent">There were several versions of supergravity around at the time of Hawking’s Lucasian Lecture. N=8 supergravity had the advantage of being the only one that worked in four dimensions (three of space and one of time), and though it called for a goodly number of as yet undiscovered particles, it did not call for an infinite number of them, as other attempts at theories of quantum gravity did. The name N=8 came from the fact that in this theory the graviton had not just one but eight supersymmetric partners. A little awkward for processing down the aisle, but it worked well in the theory.</p>
<p class="indent">It was not long after his Lucasian Lecture that Hawking and others realized how stupendously difficult it was to do any calculations using what had seemed to be such a <span id="page161">promising</span> theory. In addition to the graviton and the eight gravitinos, there were 154 types of particles. The general conclusion was that it would take about four years to finish a calculation, even if you used a computer – making sure to account for all the particles, searching for infinities that might still lurk somewhere, and being sure not to make an error!</p>
<p class="indent">Another problem was that none of the supersymmetric partners had ever been observed or looked likely to be. The theory says they have the same mass as their ‘normal’ partners, but this symmetry (in the world we can observe) is ‘broken’, leaving the supersymmetric partners hundreds, even thousands of times more massive. The energy required to discover them in a lab is tremendous. ‘Symmetry-breaking’ is something we’ll return to in another context.</p>
<p class="indent">The ‘Higgs field’, proposed in 1964 by Peter Higgs at the University of Edinburgh, theoretically pervades the entire universe and is responsible for the symmetry-breaking that makes the supersymmetric partners so difficult to discover experimentally, and also for the masses of more familiar particles. If the theory is right, the Higgs field should show up as the ‘Higgs particle’, with spin 0. The Higgs particle itself is very massive and has never been observed, but, if it indeed exists, it may be discoverable with the high energies of the Large Hadron Collider at CERN on the Swiss–French border at Geneva. One of Hawking’s famous bets is that the Higgs particle will not turn up at all. He has become more interested in the possibility that the LHC may discover some of the supersymmetric partners, or perhaps produce a mini-black hole.</p>
<p class="indent" id="page162">In the spring of 1980, when Hawking gave his Lucasian Lecture, Jane was working towards her doctoral oral examination, scheduled for June. No one was surprised when she passed. She would not be officially graduated until April 1981, but with her degree now a certainty, she began to tutor local children in French, and then took a part-time position at the Cambridge Centre for Sixth Form Studies, helping students prepare for their sixth-form examinations and gain entrance to university.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch8ref12" id="rch8ref12">12</a></sup> A little later, degree in hand, she became a teacher at sixth-form level. The beginning of her professional career was something of an anticlimax after her years of labour to finish her thesis. There was still a dispiriting gap between her own considerable intellectual achievements and the much more conspicuous success of her husband. Nevertheless, ‘It is fulfilling a part of me,’ she said, ‘that I feel has been suppressed for a long time and the marvellous thing is that it is totally compatible with what goes on at home.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch8ref13" id="rch8ref13">13</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Tim was a toddler, Robert was thriving at the Perse School, and Lucy had become a favourite at her primary school. The first I ever heard of any of the Hawkings was a comment from the head teacher at Newnham Croft Primary School that my six-year-old daughter reminded her of Lucy Hawking. This was obviously meant as a compliment. When I met Lucy, I found that it was. She by then had finished at the school but was back for a visit, helping with the small children in the playground. A radiant, clean-cut, blonde sixteen-year-old, she was brimming with intelligence and personality, with a thoughtfulness and composure beyond her years. She said her father was a physicist at Cambridge, but she hoped to go to Oxford instead because she had lived in Cambridge <span id="page163">all</span> her life and wanted a change of scene. Lucy told interviewers that she was not like her father. ‘I was never any good at science. I even managed to be hopeless at maths as well, which was slightly embarrassing.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch8ref14" id="rch8ref14">14</a></sup> But she was a fine student and cellist. It’s unlikely anyone has ever wagered a bag of sweets against her success or that of her brothers.</p>
<p class="h">Trouble in the Attic</p>
<p class="noindent">The year spent at the California Institute of Technology in 1974–5 had been such a success from Stephen Hawking’s point of view and that of his hosts that he began a habit of returning for a month almost every year. Caltech renewed and extended his Sherman Fairchild Distinguished Scholar appointment to make this possible.</p>
<p class="indent">By 1980, Kip Thorne had noticed a change in Hawking’s attitude towards his research, summed up when Hawking told him: ‘I would rather be right than rigorous.’ This rather enigmatic statement referred to the fact that most mathematicians are satisfied with nothing less than a firm mathematical proof that they are correct. That had been Hawking’s attitude in the 1960s and 1970s. Now he was saying that such rigour is not necessarily the best way to arrive at ‘right’. It could lead one not to see the forest for the trees. He had become more speculative, happy to be perhaps 95 per cent sure of something and then move on. ‘Stubbornly intuitive’ was how <em class="calibre1">New York Times</em> columnist Dennis Overbye described him.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch8ref15" id="rch8ref15">15</a></sup> Though Hawking’s intuition was often on target, for him the quest for certainty had changed to a quest for ‘high probability and rapid movement towards the ultimate goal of understanding the nature of the universe’.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch8ref16" id="rch8ref16">16</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent" id="page164">Hawking’s experience of California had broadened to include more than Los Angeles and Pasadena. He liked the steep streets of San Francisco and the opportunities they offered for a dare-devil in a motorized wheelchair. He was just as reckless a driver now as he had been when he took Jane Wilde to the Trinity Hall May Ball in 1963. His colleague Leonard Susskind remembers him poised at the top of the steepest section of one of those hills, with an incline so severe that motorists shudder, fearing that their brakes must surely fail or the car somersault forward. Hawking flashed his companions one of his mischievous smiles and then disappeared, barrelling down the hill, almost in free fall. When they caught up with him at the bottom he was sitting there grinning with satisfaction and asked them to take him to a steeper hill.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch8ref17" id="rch8ref17">17</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">In San Francisco in 1981, Hawking called attention to an issue that troubled some of his colleagues far more than his reckless disregard for the hazards of San Francisco streets. The venue was more than eccentric, the attic of the mansion of Werner Erhard, founder of a pop psychology called EST. EST targeted people who felt they were sadly lacking in self-confidence and were willing to pay fees of several hundred dollars for help. As many as a thousand at a time gathered for intensive two-week sessions in hotel ballrooms to submit to therapy that could be authoritarian, demeaning, and verbally and physically abusive. The claim was that they would experience at least temporarily a personal transformation and emerge enlightened, self-confident and outgoing. For some, it worked.</p>
<p class="indent">This scheme had made a fortune for Erhard. He was also a physics aficionado and he used his wealth to <span id="page165">cultivate</span> the friendship of a number of theoretical physicists at the top of their profession and not at all lacking in self-confidence, including Richard Feynman. Erhard hosted elaborate gourmet dinners for them and equipped his mansion’s attic to accommodate small, exclusive physics conferences, funded out of his pocket. Though Erhard was the founding father of what his critics regarded as a hokey, violent pop psychology, he was a pleasant, interesting, extremely intelligent man. The elite of physics chose to ignore the first persona and enjoy the second, and did not say no to what he offered them.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch8ref18" id="rch8ref18">18</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">When Stephen Hawking made his announcement at a conference in 1981 in Erhard’s attic, he was still able to speak with his own voice, but it had been several years since anyone except those who knew him best could understand him. His interpreter on this occasion was Martin Rocek, then a Junior Research Fellow at the DAMTP, later to make his name in physics in the areas of string theory and supersymmetry. Rocek travelled with Hawking on that trip to California, struggling more or less successfully to understand him and repeat his words clearly for others. Film clips made of this process show what a prodigious effort was involved. For most lectures, such as his Lucasian Lecture, Hawking’s graduate assistant would deliver the talk and ‘[Hawking] would just sit around and add brief comments if a student would say something wrong’.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch8ref19" id="rch8ref19">19</a></sup> Whatever the Byzantine nature of the process involved, Hawking’s announcement in Erhard’s attic was clear enough.</p>
<p class="indent">He had been focusing his attention on black holes for about fifteen years, arriving at equations of such simple clarity and elegance that he felt they had to be correct. <span id="page166">Such</span> results, he insisted, reveal a deep harmony underlying nature.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch8ref20" id="rch8ref20">20</a></sup> By 1981, hardly anyone was treating Hawking radiation as a dubious concept. But Hawking had begun to realize, at least as early as his sabbatical in Pasadena in 1974–5, that at the heart of the equations surrounding that discovery lurked a paradox that threatened to undermine the whole of physics. It had to do with the loss of information in black holes and the threat this posed to a fundamental tenet of physics, the law of information conservation: information can never be lost from the universe. Don Page, in 1979, had been the first to disagree with Stephen’s conclusion, but Stephen had not budged.</p>
<p class="indent">It’s important to understand what ‘information’ means in this context. You can think of this lost information as information about everything that went into making the black hole in the first place and everything that fell in later. But what does a theoretical physicist mean by ‘information’? The clue is in the words ‘information encoded in the particles that make up the universe’.</p>
<p class="indent">Here, from the history of the study of black holes, is an example that helps explain what ‘information’ means to a theoretical physicist: in his book <em class="calibre1">The Black Hole War</em>, Leonard Susskind tells of an Einstein-like thought experiment performed by Jacob Bekenstein when he was considering the question of the entropy of a black hole. (Bekenstein’s proposals, you will recall, presented a challenge to Stephen Hawking in 1972.) It’s hard to imagine that anything could take much less information into a black hole than a single photon falling in, but, in fact, one photon does carry a good deal of information. Most <span id="page167">significantly</span> for Bekenstein, it carries into the black hole information about the location where it fell in.</p>
<p class="indent">Bekenstein wanted to consider a smaller amount of information than that for his thought experiment. He wanted to reduce the amount of information to one ‘bit’, a unit of information suggested by John Wheeler that has the smallest possible size in the universe – a quantum distance calculated by Max Planck in the early twentieth century. In order to achieve this, Bekenstein made use of Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle and imagined ‘smearing out’ the location where the photon fell in. He imagined a photon of such long wavelength that the probability of its entry point would be spread out over the entire event horizon, making it as uncertain as possible, so that it would convey only a single ‘bit’ of information – that the photon was, in fact, inside the black hole. The photon’s presence would add to the mass of the black hole and, of course, to the area of the event horizon, by a minuscule amount, which Bekenstein proceeded to calculate.</p>
<p class="indent">Obviously, ‘information’ in this story means something a little more subtle than what you and I normally think of as everyday ‘information’. It isn’t only information such as what channel John Wheeler’s television was tuned to when it fell into the black hole.</p>
<p class="indent">The idea of information disappearing into a black hole and becoming inaccessible to those on the outside was not new to anyone at the conference. Locked-away information like that is not a violation of information conservation. The information in a black hole may be inaccessible to anyone on the outside, but it is still in the universe. Hawking was thinking of something more <span id="page168">drastic</span>. When a black hole has finally radiated all of its mass away and disappeared, what has actually happened to everything that went into forming the black hole and everything that later fell in?</p>
<p class="indent">If you have been following this book carefully, you may be raising your hand to suggest that it would all have been recycled as Hawking radiation. That radiation, of course, would not look anything like, say, a hapless astronaut who fell in, but could it somehow be the solution to the problem? After all, the law of information conservation has it that information encoded in the particles of which everything in the universe is made up can be scrambled, chopped up, destroyed, but if the fundamental laws of physics as we now understand them are correct, it can always be retrieved from the particles that make it up. In principle, with the information in hand, anything can be restored.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch8ref21" id="rch8ref21">21</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">For example, let’s say you burned this book. You might think you would never be able to finish reading it. However, <em class="calibre1">in principle</em>, if you could study the burning process carefully enough to trace all the molecular interactions that turned the book to ashes, then by running the process backwards you could have the book again. It would be a lot easier to go out and buy another copy, but <em class="calibre1">in principle</em> you <em class="calibre1">could</em> reconstruct it.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch8ref22" id="rch8ref22">22</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Hawking would have none of that. He insisted that Hawking radiation could not serve as the escape vehicle back into the outside universe for information trapped in a black hole. If you tossed this book into a black hole, such reconstruction would be impossible. Hawking radiation is not the ‘ashes’ or the scrambled or chopped-up remains of what fell into the black hole. Recall that the <span id="page169">‘escaping’</span> member of the particle pair in Hawking radiation (the way it was explained in <a href="../Text/chapter_006_split_000.html">Chapter 6</a>) doesn’t come from inside the black hole. It comes from just outside. The escaping particle carries with it no news whatsoever about whether the black hole is full of astronauts, unmatched socks, or Winnie the Pooh’s grandmother’s honeypot. It doesn’t know. Hawking radiation has no direct connection to whatever went into forming the black hole in the first place or what has fallen in. There are some physicists who held out hope that such information is somehow encoded in the Hawking radiation, but Hawking was not one of them. He thought that information does not escape and is completely lost when the black hole evaporates. You can’t restore it, not even in principle. Hawking christened the dilemma he had raised ‘the information paradox’.</p>
<p class="indent">The problem looked likely to extend beyond black holes. In an interview on the BBC programme <em class="calibre1">Horizon</em> in 2005, Leonard Susskind, who was there in Erhard’s attic, remembers his shock at Hawking’s arguments and the realization that if Hawking was right – if information really is irretrievably lost in black holes – then that is not the only place it is going to be lost. Pieces of the universe must be missing. We can forget about predictability. Forget the dependability of cause and effect. Nothing we think we know in science can be trusted.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch8ref23" id="rch8ref23">23</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Hawking perceived that Susskind was probably the only person present who fully realized the implications of his arguments. ‘Leonard Susskind got very upset,’ he remembers. Scientists, and the rest of us, rely on the link between past and future, between cause and effect. That link is lost if information is lost. ‘We wouldn’t be able to <span id="page170">predict</span> the future. We can’t be sure of our past history either. The history books and our memories could be just illusions. It is the past that tells us who we are. Without it we lose our identity.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch8ref24" id="rch8ref24">24</a></sup> Kip Thorne pointed out that there was already speculation about the existence of black holes that are smaller than atoms that could be anywhere and everywhere, nibbling away bits of information.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch8ref25" id="rch8ref25">25</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">The problem may not seem so disastrous to you or me. Granted, when anything falls into a black hole it carries information with it. The colour and size of a few unmatched socks? Perhaps the dimensions of the unfortunate astronaut? Not information that you or I find interesting or essential. However, this information is necessary, even for a more limited kind of prediction allowed by quantum mechanics.</p>
<p class="indent">Hawking traces the discussion about being able to predict the future or the past to Pierre-Simon de Laplace, a mathematician who lived in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Laplace’s famous proposal was that an omniscient being with unlimited powers of calculation, knowing the laws of the universe and the state of everything in it (that is, the positions and momenta of all the particles in the universe) at any given time, would be able to calculate the state of everything in the universe at any other time in the past or future. Though no one denied the stupefying practical difficulties of acquiring such knowledge and doing all the calculations, Laplace-style scientific determinism remained dogma through the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. When I heard Hawking lecturing on the subject in Cambridge, he quoted Laplace in French and told us that since we were a Cambridge audience he would not insult our <span id="page171">intelligence</span> by offering a translation. One nevertheless soon slyly appeared on his slide screen.</p>
<p class="indent">Laplace’s omniscient being had to have knowledge of the positions and momenta of <em class="calibre1">all</em> particles in the universe. You can’t leave out the particles in the toe of the sock. When the sock falls into the black hole, that information is lost from our region of the universe. If black holes exist for ever, well and good, then the lost information isn’t entirely lost. It is inaccessible, but still there. If black holes evaporate and disappear from the universe … trouble.</p>
<p class="indent">Hawking and his colleagues in the attic knew that the ‘information paradox’ was not the first challenge to Laplace-style scientific determinism. In the mid-1920s when Werner Heisenberg published his ‘uncertainty principle’, it seemed all bets must be off … but only for a while. Arguments having to do with interpretations and implications of the uncertainty principle would go on for years and involve the finest minds in physics, but by the time Hawking studied black holes there was fairly general agreement that even Laplace’s omniscient being could not possibly know precisely a particle’s position and momentum at the same time.</p>
<p class="indent">The uncertainty principle did not, however, ultimately succeed in undermining faith in the dogma of scientific determinism. It soon became clear that laws governing the quantum level of the universe are deterministic in a different way. You can predict what is called the ‘quantum state’, from which both positions and momenta can be calculated with a certain degree of accuracy. Laplace’s omniscient being, knowing the quantum state of the universe at any one moment in time, and the laws of <span id="page172">science</span>, could predict the quantum state of the universe at any other time, past or future.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch8ref26" id="rch8ref26">26</a></sup><a href="#FT1pg172" id="rFT1pg172">fn1</a></p>
<p class="indent">Now, Hawking had found a new problem, and it seemed to be a serious one. His earlier work had shown that black holes don’t last for ever. As Hawking radiation continues, the black hole gets smaller until eventually there is no black hole left. He was insisting that the information about whatever went into forming the black hole in the first place, and whatever fell in, is then irretrievably lost.</p>
<p class="indent">Still … why all the angst about its loss? Couldn’t the universe make do with a little less of this rather arcane information?</p>
<p class="indent">No, it seems it cannot. Not and still be the universe we think we know. The law of information conservation is one of the fundamental principles of physics. Information is <em class="calibre1">never</em> lost. It can be mixed and scrambled and transformed in ways that make it unrecognizable as the information you started with, but not ever lost. If this law is wrong, then the universe is in effect thumbing its nose at Laplace and all those who have been assuming that he was correct.</p>
<p class="indent">Although Hawking’s colleagues in Erhard’s attic, in Susskind’s words, stood there in ‘stunned confusion’, most of them and other theoretical physicists would go right on <span id="page173">believing</span> that the present has evolved from the past and will go on evolving into the future, that cause and effect continue to operate, that it is meaningful to trace events into the past and into the future, that examining the debris from a collision in a particle accelerator can tell you what happened in the collision – as though Hawking had not hung a Sword of Damocles over all these assumptions. But Hawking stuck to his guns and the information paradox didn’t go away. Information, he continued to insist, is truly lost when black holes evaporate, and this means we can predict even less than we thought on the basis of quantum theory.</p>
<p class="indent">Was there a fly in the ointment of quantum mechanics? Would the foundations of this well-established, dependable field have to shift? Hawking thought they would. As Kip Thorne has commented, Hawking is stubborn about insisting on his views of how nature works, and he likes to challenge others to show he’s wrong.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch8ref27" id="rch8ref27">27</a></sup> Hawking had laid down the gauntlet. Susskind recalls that in Erhard’s attic ‘Stephen had a “Stephen” look on his face, a little smile that says, “You may not believe it but I’m right, no mistake about it.” We were absolutely sure Stephen was wrong but we couldn’t see why.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch8ref28" id="rch8ref28">28</a></sup></p>
<p class="footnote-ts"><a href="#rFT1pg172" id="FT1pg172">fn1</a> Hawking’s ideas were not the only serious threat to determinism in the 1980s. An equally significant one came from chaos theory. Ilya Prigogine and Isobel Stengers presented this challenge in their 1985 book <em class="calibre1">Order Out of Chaos</em>, writing, ‘When faced with these unstable systems Laplace’s [omniscient being] is just as powerless as we.’ (Ilya Prigogine and Isobel Stengers, <em class="calibre1">Order Out of Chaos</em>, London: Heinemann, 1985.)</p>
