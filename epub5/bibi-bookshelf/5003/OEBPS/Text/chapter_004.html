<p class="chaptitle">‘The realization that I had an incurable disease, that was likely to kill me in a few years, was a bit of a shock’</p>
<p class="noindent"><span><span class="small">HAWKING’S FIRST YEAR</span></span> at cambridge was largely a disaster. Fred Hoyle already had his full quota of graduate students and Stephen was assigned Denis Sciama instead. Sciama was a lesser name in physics than Hoyle – in fact, Stephen had never heard of him – but others knew him to be a fine mentor who cared deeply about his students. He also was far more available in Cambridge than Hoyle, who was an international figure and spent much of his time at observatories in other parts of the world. Sciama and Hoyle both favoured the ‘Steady State’ theory of the universe. Hoyle, with Hermann Bondi and Tom Gold, had fathered that theory.</p>
<p class="indent">The Steady State theory recognized the expansion of the universe but, unlike the Big Bang theory, did not <span id="page64">require</span> the universe to have a beginning in time. The proposal was that as the universe expands, with galaxies moving apart from one another, new matter appears to fill the increasingly large gaps among them, eventually forming new stars and galaxies. At any moment in its history and future, the universe looks pretty much the same as it does at any other time. The Steady State was destined to lose the contest with the Big Bang theory, but for a while it seemed a brilliantly viable competitor.</p>
<p class="indent">For someone with Hawking’s slipshod mathematics background, general relativity was rough going, and he soon sorely regretted allowing his father to steer him away from maths at Oxford. Sciama suggested that he might concentrate on astrophysics, but Stephen had firmly set his sights on general relativity and cosmology. Keeping his head barely above water, he undertook a quick, arduous self-education. At King’s College London, Hermann Bondi had started a course in general relativity. Stephen, along with other Cambridge graduate students, travelled there regularly for lectures.</p>
<p class="indent">Relativity and cosmology were risky choices even for those sufficiently well prepared in mathematics. The scientific community regarded cosmology with some suspicion and disfavour. As Hawking would later recall, ‘Cosmology used to be considered a pseudoscience and the preserve of physicists who might have done useful work in their earlier years, but who had gone mystic in their dotage.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch4ref1" id="rch4ref1">1</a></sup> It was highly speculative, with in sufficient observational data to curb or shape speculation.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch4ref2" id="rch4ref2">2</a></sup> Sciama himself, just two years before Hawking met him, wrote that cosmology was ‘a highly controversial subject, which contains little or no agreed body of doctrine’.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch4ref3" id="rch4ref3">3</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent" id="page65">Hawking was aware of these difficulties, but the challenge of working at the frontiers and venturing into unexplored territory was irresistible. Cosmology and general relativity were ‘neglected fields that were ripe for development at that time. Unlike elementary particles, there was a well-defined theory, Einstein’s general theory of relativity, thought to be impossibly difficult. People were so pleased to find any solution to [Einstein’s] field equations; they didn’t ask what physical significance, if any, it had.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch4ref4" id="rch4ref4">4</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Einstein’s general theory of relativity was indeed, as Hawking pointed out, a well-defined theory in which gravity is explained as the warping of spacetime, but Sciama had been right about cosmology. The battle still raged about which theory could correctly describe the history of the universe – the Big Bang theory or the Steady State theory. Had the universe had a beginning or not? In the twenty-first century, it seems incredible that when Hawking came up to Cambridge as a graduate student in 1962, that contest had not yet by any means been settled.</p>
<p class="indent">Hawking’s failure to get Hoyle as his supervisor and his mathematical deficiencies were setbacks, but no more than typical for a first-year graduate student. While he struggled to catch up on general relativity and find a way through the mathematical maze needed to understand it, a far more unusual and merciless problem was overtaking him in the autumn of 1962, threatening to make all this effort meaningless. The clumsiness he had noticed during his third year at Oxford kept getting worse. That first autumn in Cambridge, he had trouble tying his shoes and sometimes had a problem talking. His speech became <span id="page66">slurred</span>, enough so that those who met him for the first time assumed he had a slight speech impediment.</p>
<p class="indent">When he went home to St Albans for Christmas after his first term in Cambridge, Stephen’s physical problems were too obvious to conceal from his parents. Frank Hawking took his son to the family doctor. That doctor referred them to a specialist. They made an appointment for after the holidays.</p>
<p class="indent">Shortly after his twenty-first birthday in January, Hawking found himself not heading back to Cambridge for the Lent term but in St Bartholomew’s Hospital in London for tests. Perhaps it made the situation a little less daunting that his sister Mary, preparing to follow their father into medicine, was in training at ‘Bart’s’. Stephen refused the private hospital room his parents had wanted for him, because of his ‘socialist principles’. In hospital, specialists took a muscle sample from his arm, stuck electrodes into him, and injected radio-opaque fluid into his spine and watched it going up and down with X-rays while they tilted the bed on which he lay. After two weeks they released him, telling him vaguely that what he had wasn’t a ‘typical case’ and that it wasn’t multiple sclerosis. The doctors suggested he go back to Cambridge and get on with his work. ‘I gathered,’ Hawking remembers, ‘that they expected it to continue to get worse, and that there was nothing they could do, except give me vitamins. I could see that they didn’t expect them to have much effect. I didn’t feel like asking for more details, because they were obviously bad.’</p>
<p class="indent">Isobel Hawking did not immediately learn how seriously ill her son was, until, out ice skating with her, he fell and couldn’t get up. Finally off the ice, she bundled <span id="page67">him</span> into a café and pressured him to talk about the physical difficulties he was having and what the doctors were saying. She insisted on conferring with his doctor herself, and was given the same devastating news.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch4ref5" id="rch4ref5">5</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Hawking had contracted a rare disease for which there is no known cure, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), known in Britain as motor neurone disease, in America as Lou Gehrig’s disease. It causes a gradual disintegration of the nerve cells in the spinal cord and brain that regulate voluntary muscle activity. The first symptoms are usually weakness and twitching of the hands, and perhaps slurred speech and difficulty in swallowing. As nerve cells disintegrate, the muscles they control atrophy. Eventually this happens to every voluntary muscle of the body. Movement becomes impossible. Speech and all other means of communication are lost. Though Hawking is not the only patient to have survived for several decades, death almost always occurs within two or three years as a result of pneumonia or suffocation when the respiratory muscles fail. The disease does not affect involuntary muscles of the heart, muscles of waste elimination or the sexual organs, and the brain remains completely lucid to the end. To some this seems an advantage, to others a horror. Patients in the final stages of the disease are often given morphine, not for pain – there is none – but for panic and depression.</p>
<p class="indent">For Hawking everything had changed. With typical understatement, he describes his reaction: ‘The realization that I had an incurable disease, that was likely to kill me in a few years, was a bit of a shock. How could something like that happen to me? Why should I be cut off like this? However, while I had been in hospital, I had seen a boy I <span id="page68">vaguely</span> knew die of leukaemia in the bed opposite me. It had not been a pretty sight. Clearly there were people who were worse off than I. At least, my condition didn’t make me feel sick. Whenever I feel inclined to be sorry for myself, I remember that boy.’</p>
<p class="indent">Nevertheless, at first Hawking went into a deep depression. He didn’t know what he ought to do, what was going to happen to him, how quickly he would get worse, or what it would be like. His doctors had told him to continue his Ph.D. research, but that had already been going poorly. This fact was almost as depressing to him as his illness. It seemed pointless to try to continue working towards a doctorate he wouldn’t live to receive, nothing but a foolish device for keeping his mind preoccupied while his body was dying. He holed up miserably in his college rooms at Trinity Hall, but he insists: ‘Reports in magazine articles that I drank heavily are an exaggeration. I felt somewhat of a tragic character. I took to listening to Wagner.</p>
<p class="indent">‘My dreams at that time were rather disturbed,’ he remembers. ‘Before my condition had been diagnosed, I had been very bored with life. There had not seemed to be anything worth doing. But shortly after I came out of hospital, I dreamt that I was going to be executed. I suddenly realized that there were a lot of worthwhile things I could do, if I were reprieved. Another dream that I had several times was that I would sacrifice my life to save others. After all, if I were going to die anyway, it might as well do some good.’</p>
<p class="indent">Frank Hawking took advantage of all the connections his stature in the medical profession made available to him. He contacted experts in every possibly related disease, but <span id="page69">all</span> was in vain. Hawking’s doctors hoped his condition would stabilize, but the disease progressed rapidly. They soon informed him that he did indeed have only about two years to live. At that point his father appealed to Denis Sciama to help Stephen finish his dissertation early. Sciama, knowing Hawking’s potential and unwilling to let him compromise even if he was dying, turned the request down.</p>
<p class="indent">Two years passed. The progression of the disease slowed. ‘I didn’t die. In fact, although there was a cloud hanging over my future, I found to my surprise that I was enjoying life in the present more than before.’ He had to use a cane, but his condition wasn’t all that bad. Total disability and death, though still a not-too-distant certainty, were postponed. Sciama suggested that since he was going to live a while longer, he ought to finish his thesis. Hawking had his reprieve, a precarious and temporary one, but life was precious and full of worthwhile things.</p>
<p class="indent">In January 1963, just before Hawking entered the hospital for tests, Basil King and his sister Diana had hosted a New Year’s party in St Albans. There, Hawking had met Diana’s friend Jane Wilde,<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch4ref6" id="rch4ref6">6</a></sup> who was just finishing at St Albans High School and had been accepted to study languages the next autumn at Westfield College in the University of London. Jane later described Stephen as she caught sight of him at that party – ‘slight of frame, leaning against the wall in a corner with his back to the light, gesticulating with long thin fingers as he spoke – his hair falling across his face over his glasses – and wearing a dusty black-velvet jacket and a red-velvet bow tie.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch4ref7" id="rch4ref7">7</a></sup> Embroidering somewhat on the story of his viva at Oxford (the oral exam that finally won him his First), he <span id="page70">regaled</span> her and a friend of his from Oxford with the story that he had tempted the examiners to give him a First and let him go to Cambridge by giving them the opportunity to send him, like a Trojan horse, into the rival university.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch4ref8" id="rch4ref8">8</a></sup> To Jane this dishevelled graduate student seemed terribly intelligent, eccentric and rather arrogant. But he was interesting, and she liked his self-mocking wit. He said he was studying cosmology. She didn’t know what that meant.</p>
<p class="indent">Stephen and Jane exchanged names and addresses at the party, and a few days later Jane received an invitation to a birthday celebration – his twenty-first – on 8 January. The party was Jane’s first experience of the eccentric Hawking home at 14 Hillside Road, St Albans. Though she recognized most of the family as familiar faces in St Albans, she felt painfully unsophisticated among them and their friends, and she spent most of the evening in a corner near the fire, trying to stay warm in the icy cold house, holding Stephen’s younger brother Edward on her lap. The evening cannot have been a total success for Stephen either. His physical problems were becoming impossible to conceal. He had trouble pouring the drinks.</p>
<p class="indent">About a month later, Jane overheard Diana King and a friend discuss the news that Stephen had been diagnosed with ‘some terrible, paralysing incurable disease … a bit like multiple sclerosis, but it’s not multiple sclerosis and they reckon he’s probably only got a couple of years to live’.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch4ref9" id="rch4ref9">9</a></sup> Diana’s brother Basil had been to visit him in the hospital.</p>
<p class="indent">It came as a surprise when Jane encountered Stephen a week later on the railway platform in St Albans, looking much as he had before but more conventionally dressed and with a neater haircut. They were both waiting for the train to London. On the journey, they sat together and <span id="page71">talked</span>. When Jane mentioned that she had been sorry to hear about his hospital stay, Stephen wrinkled his nose and said nothing.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch4ref10" id="rch4ref10">10</a></sup> She dropped the subject. He asked her whether she would like to go to the theatre with him some weekend when he was home from Cambridge. She said she would.</p>
<p class="indent">Their first date was for dinner and the theatre in London. The evening turned out to be so expensive that when they had boarded the bus back towards the railway station, Stephen realized that he had run out of funds. There were no ATMs in those days. After treating this young lady to a truly lavish first date, he had to ask her whether she could pay the bus fare. Rummaging around in her handbag, Jane discovered that her purse was not there, and so began their first adventure together.</p>
<p class="indent">Scuttling off the bus before anyone could ask for their fare, Jane and Stephen returned to the darkened, shut Old Vic theatre and found a way in by the stage door. Jane’s purse was under the seat where it had fallen and all seemed to be turning out well when the lights went out completely. Stephen took her hand, and they groped their way back on to the stage and across it in total darkness, and out of the stage door again, Jane following Stephen’s sure lead ‘with silent admiration’.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch4ref11" id="rch4ref11">11</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Stephen was definitely not the pizza-and-a-movie type of man, for his next invitation was to the Trinity Hall May Ball. Dinner and the theatre in London and a Cambridge May Ball were certainly among the most seriously splendid dates a girl might hope for.</p>
<p class="indent">When Stephen arrived in June<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#FT1pg71" id="rFT1pg71">fn1</a></sup> to take Jane to <span id="page72">Cambridge</span>, the deterioration of his physical condition shocked her. She wondered whether this ‘slight, frail, limping figure who appeared to use the steering wheel to hoist himself up to see over the dashboard’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch4ref12" id="rch4ref12">12</a></sup> was capable of driving the car to Cambridge. The hazards of the journey, however, stemmed not from Stephen’s disability but from the recklessness and speed of his driving. They arrived with Jane vowing to herself to take the train home rather than repeat this experience.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch4ref13" id="rch4ref13">13</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Though Trinity Hall is small compared with other Cambridge colleges like Trinity and St John’s, its May Ball proved to be the magical experience a May Ball at its best should be. The lawns and flower beds, falling away towards the river and the meadows of the Backs beyond, were romantically lit, and everyone in formal attire looked remarkably better than usual. There was music to suit all tastes, in different parts of the college. A string quartet in an elegantly panelled room. A cabaret in the Hall. A jazz band. A Jamaican steel band. Champagne was served from a bathtub, and there was a lavish buffet. The festivities continued until dawn and breakfast, and the next day included a punt on the river. Jane was at first mystified but then impressed by the ability of Hawking’s friends to argue quite nastily with him one minute on some intellectual subject and then, the next, treat him with extraordinary gentleness and care for his weakened physical condition. When it was all over, Stephen, to Jane’s chagrin, would not hear of her taking the train back rather than driving with him. She arrived home so flustered and disgusted with his driving that she got out of the car, left him at the kerb and stalked into the house. At her mother’s insistence she went back to invite him in for <span id="page73">tea</span>. In spite of the extravagant date invitations, this was no romance yet, though Hawking thought she was ‘a very nice girl’,<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch4ref14" id="rch4ref14">14</a></sup> and it was at about this time that Derek Powney became puzzled about his old friend’s sudden interest in John Donne’s elegies, some of the most beautiful and explicit love poems ever written.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch4ref15" id="rch4ref15">15</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">After seeing Stephen on a few more occasions with his family and hers, Jane set off for a summer in Spain, a requirement for her language degree from Westfield College. When she returned, Stephen had departed for Cambridge again, and Jane soon left St Albans herself to live in London and begin her studies. It wasn’t until November that she heard from him. He was coming to London for a dental appointment and invited her to go with him to the Wallace Collection (a famous display of art, furniture, porcelain, arms and armour), to dinner and to Wagner’s opera <em class="calibre1">The Flying Dutchman</em>. On this date, Stephen stumbled and fell in the middle of Lower Regent Street. Jane dragged him to his feet. She noticed that as his walking became increasingly unsteady, his opinions became stronger and more defiant. On this occasion, not long after the assassination of US President Kennedy, he expressed disapproval of Kennedy’s handling of the Cuban Missile Crisis.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch4ref16" id="rch4ref16">16</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">That winter, Stephen came frequently to London for seminars and dental appointments and seemed to have a steady supply of opera tickets. Jane also travelled often to Cambridge to see him at the weekends. By this time she was definitely ‘in love with Stephen, with his wicked sense of humour. The light in his eyes was magnetic’,<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch4ref17" id="rch4ref17">17</a></sup> but she refused to have a short-term affair with him. Short term was unfortunately all he could foresee, and their <span id="page74">weekends</span> were not happy. Jane returned to London many times in tears.</p>
<p class="indent">One problem was that, voluble as Stephen could be on most matters, he was not willing to discuss his illness or share his feelings about it. Though this troubled Jane at the time, she didn’t put pressure on him. It was only later that she realized they had set a precedent of non-communication that would serve them ill in the future.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch4ref18" id="rch4ref18">18</a></sup> One day in late winter she met him after he had an appointment with his Harley Street consultant. When she asked him how it had gone, ‘he grimaced’ and told her the doctor had told him ‘not to bother to come back, because there’s nothing he can do’.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch4ref19" id="rch4ref19">19</a></sup> End of conversation.</p>
<p class="indent">Jane’s first year at Westfield was a period of spiritual questioning. It would not have been difficult to be won over to agnosticism or even atheism by this charismatic, intellectually brilliant young man, beside whom she still felt a little like an awkward teenager. But Jane stuck with the faith in God ingrained in her from childhood by her mother and also to the belief that good can come out of any disaster. She concluded that she would have to ‘maintain sufficient faith for the two of us if any good were to come of our sad plight’.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch4ref20" id="rch4ref20">20</a></sup> Stephen, though he never shared her faith, admired her energy and her optimism and gradually began to find them contagious.</p>
<p class="indent">Not everything was an upward curve. In spite of their closeness in the winter, when Jane spent a term in Spain that spring of 1964, her letters to Stephen went unanswered. During a short interval in St Albans before she departed again to spend the summer touring Europe with her family, Jane found Stephen depressed and cynical, <span id="page75">playing</span> Wagner at high volume, not bothering, for a change, to hide his sense of futility and frustration, and seemingly determined to do all he could to alienate her. As she would later tell an interviewer, ‘he was really in quite a pathetic state. I think he’d lost the will to live. He was very confused.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch4ref21" id="rch4ref21">21</a></sup> They were apart for most of the summer. Stephen went with his sister Philippa to Bayreuth for Wagner’s <em class="calibre1">Ring</em> cycle and, from there, on a journey behind the Iron Curtain to Prague.</p>
<p class="indent">Near the end of her family’s European travels, Jane found a postcard from Stephen waiting for her at their hotel in Venice. It was marvel enough that there should be one at all, but it was cheerful and informative. The picture was of the castle-fortress that towers over Salzburg, in Austria, and Stephen’s message exclaimed about the Salzburg Festival, Bayreuth and Prague. Clutching that postcard, Jane explored Venice in a romantic haze, hardly able to contain her eagerness to get back to England and Stephen.</p>
<p class="indent">When Jane got home to St Albans, she found Stephen in much better spirits than he had been earlier in the summer, in spite of having knocked out his front teeth in a fall while travelling on a train in Germany – a sad shame after all that dental work that had brought him to London. His physical condition appeared to have stabilized. He was daring to look ahead.</p>
<p class="indent">On a wet Cambridge autumn evening at the beginning of the Michaelmas term, Stephen proposed marriage and Jane agreed. ‘I wanted to find some purpose to my existence,’ she says, ‘and I suppose I found it in the idea of looking after him. But we were in love, we got married, there didn’t seem much choice in the matter. I just decided what I was going to do, and I did it.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch4ref22" id="rch4ref22">22</a></sup> They had <span id="page76">come</span> to realize, ‘that together we could make something worthwhile of our lives’.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch4ref23" id="rch4ref23">23</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">For Stephen the engagement made ‘all the difference’. ‘The engagement changed my life. It gave me something to live for. It made me determined to live. Without the help that Jane has given I would not have been able to carry on, nor have had the will to do so.’</p>
<p class="indent">Jane’s father gave his consent to the marriage on the condition that she complete her college education and that unreasonable demands not be placed on her. Frank Hawking suggested that because of his son’s brief life expectancy they have children as soon as possible. As a medical man, he assured her that Stephen’s condition was not hereditary.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch4ref24" id="rch4ref24">24</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">One obstacle to their marriage had to be dealt with immediately. Westfield College did not permit its undergraduates to marry. An exception was made on the grounds that Jane’s betrothed husband might not live until their wedding date if it were postponed. Jane was, however, required to move out of the college into private accommodation in London. There she would spend her week days, returning to Cambridge and Stephen at weekends.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch4ref25" id="rch4ref25">25</a></sup> Stephen also had to move out of college housing and find new lodgings.</p>
<p class="indent">Hawking’s natural buoyancy returned. He found an ingenious way of phoning London for only the cost of a local Cambridge call, and in long telephone conversations ‘illness assumed the proportions of a minor background irritant as we talked about job prospects, housing, wedding arrangements, and our first trip to the United States … due to start just ten days after the wedding’.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch4ref26" id="rch4ref26">26</a></sup> Hawking was at last making progress with his studies. He <span id="page77">decided</span> to count himself supremely lucky that his illness would never touch his mind, no matter how it might paralyse his body. Work in theoretical physics was going to take place almost entirely in his mind. It was one of the few careers he might have chosen in which physical disability wouldn’t be a serious handicap.</p>
<p class="indent">This attitude sounds courageous, but it embarrasses Stephen Hawking to hear himself described that way. It would have been courageous and required tremendous willpower, he thinks, to have chosen such a difficult course deliberately, but that wasn’t how it happened. He simply did the only thing possible. As he puts it, ‘One has to be grown up enough to realize that life is not fair. You just have to do the best you can in the situation you are in.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch4ref27" id="rch4ref27">27</a></sup> It was true in 1964, and still is today, that, as far as he is concerned, the less made of his physical problems the better. If this book were to talk about his scientific work and fail entirely to mention that doing such work possibly represents more of an achievement for him than it would for most people, that would suit him fine. One of the most important things you can learn about him is how unimportant his disability is. It isn’t accurate to call him a sick man. Health involves much more than physical condition, and in this broader sense for most of his life he’s been one of the healthiest persons around. That message comes through loud and clear in his writing and in most of the things written about him, and it is even more apparent when you’re with him. That’s the Hawking image, and though we should take seriously his warning ‘You shouldn’t believe everything you read’, it isn’t a fake image.</p>
<p class="indent">Meanwhile, no marriage was possible until he had a job, and no job was possible without a Ph.D. He began <span id="page78">looking</span> for an idea with which to complete his thesis.</p>
<p class="h">Challenging the Future</p>
<p class="noindent">Though Hawking’s life had been in turmoil since the diagnosis in the winter of 1963, neither his deteriorating physical condition nor his growing preoccupation with Jane Wilde had eclipsed his interest in cosmology. His office in the Department of Applied Maths and Theoretical Physics was next door to Jayant Narlikar, whom Hawking had met on a summer course before coming up to Cambridge. Narlikar was one of Hoyle’s students and working with Hoyle on possible modifications to general relativity that might reconcile the Steady State model with recent observations that called it into question. This challenge piqued Hawking’s curiosity.</p>
<p class="indent">In June 1964, prior to publication of Hoyle’s work with Narlikar, Hoyle gave a lecture about it at the Royal Society. Hawking travelled to London to attend. When the floor was opened for questions, Hawking rose to his feet with the help of his stick and challenged one of Hoyle’s results. An astonished Hoyle asked Hawking how he could possibly judge whether the result was right or wrong. Hawking replied that he had ‘worked it out’. Unaware that Hawking and Narlikar had discussed the results many times and that Hawking had done calculations of his own, Hoyle and the audience assumed that this unknown research student had ‘worked it out’ in his head right there at the lecture. The audience was impressed; Hoyle was infuriated. Surprisingly, Hawking seems not to have lost the friendship of Narlikar. In any case, his reputation for brilliance and brashness had begun, and so had his interest in calculations and <span id="page79">speculation</span> having to do with the expanding universe.</p>
<p class="indent">Hawking learned about a theory of the British mathematician and physicist Roger Penrose concerning what happens when a star has no nuclear fuel left to burn and collapses under the force of its own gravity. Penrose, building on earlier work by such physicists as Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar and John Wheeler, claimed that even if the collapse isn’t perfectly smooth and symmetrical, the star will nevertheless be crushed to a tiny point of infinite density and infinite curvature of space-time, a singularity at the heart of a black hole.</p>
<p class="indent">Hawking took off from there by reversing the direction of time, imagining a point of infinite density and infinite curvature of spacetime – a singularity – exploding outwards and expanding. Suppose, he suggested, the universe began like that. Suppose spacetime, curled up tight in a tiny, dimensionless point, exploded in what we call the Big Bang and expanded until it looks the way it does today. Might it have happened like that? <em class="calibre1">Must</em> it have happened like that?</p>
<p class="indent">With these questions, Hawking began the intellectual adventure that has continued for more than forty-five years. As he says, ‘I started working hard for the first time in my life. To my surprise, I found I liked it. Maybe it is not really fair to call it work.’</p>
<p class="h">1965</p>
<p class="noindent">In the winter of 1965 Hawking applied for a research fellowship at Gonville and Caius College in Cambridge. Jane came up for the weekend from London, where she was still living while completing her degree at Westfield College, and Hawking reported that ‘I was hoping that <span id="page80">Jane</span> would type my application, but she had her arm in plaster, having broken it. I must admit that I was less sympathetic than I should have been. However, it was her left arm, so she was able to write out my application to my dictation, and I got someone else to type it.’</p>
<p class="indent">Jane’s arm was not the worst setback he encountered applying for the Caius fellowship. He was asked to name two persons as references. Denis Sciama suggested Hermann Bondi. Stephen had attended lectures in Bondi’s general relativity course at King’s College London, but did not know him well. ‘I had met him a couple of times and he had communicated a paper I had written to the Royal Society. I asked him [about giving a reference] after a lecture he gave in Cambridge. He looked at me in a vague way and said, yes, he would. Obviously, he didn’t remember me, for, when the College wrote to him for a reference, he replied that he had not heard of me.’ That should have doomed Hawking’s chances. It might today, with so many applying for research fellowships, but he was fortunate. ‘Those were quieter times. The College wrote to tell me of the embarrassing reply of my referee. My supervisor got on to Bondi and refreshed his memory. Bondi then wrote me a reference that was probably far better than I deserved. Anyway I got the fellowship.’</p>
<p class="indent">Another boost to Stephen’s professional standing in the spring of 1965 was a ‘commendation prize’ in the privately funded Gravity Prize Competition. He might have done better than ‘commendation’ had he not missed the deadline for submissions, but, with his wedding coming up, £100 was welcome.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch4ref28" id="rch4ref28">28</a></sup> During that same spring, at an international conference on general relativity and gravitation in London – the first such event he ever <span id="page81">attended</span> – Stephen met Kip Thorne from the California Institute of Technology. Thorne already had his Ph.D. from Princeton. Thorne was deeply impressed with the way this young man who walked with a cane and seemed somewhat wobbly, and spoke with a slight hesitation, was taking techniques introduced into general relativity by Roger Penrose and adapting them to investigate the structure and history of the universe. Their conversation in a tearoom at the conference was the beginning of a life-long friendship. Thorne is one of a handful of friends, perhaps the only one, with whom Hawking has had frank, matter-of-fact discussions about his bleak expectations for the future.</p>
<p class="indent">On 14 July 1965, Stephen Hawking and Jane Wilde were married in a civil ceremony, followed the next day by a religious ceremony in the chapel of Trinity Hall.</p>
<p class="indent">Theoretical physics is full of paradoxes. It seems appropriate that one of our great theoretical physicists is a man whose enthusiasm for life was awakened by a tragedy that ought to have embittered and destroyed him, and that his meteoric rise as a scientist started with the practical need for a thesis topic so that he could get a job and marry. With what simplicity Hawking described it: in spite of the Wagner, the tragic hero self-image and the dreams; a year, maybe more, of depression … then ‘I was happier than I’d been before.’</p>
