<p class="chaptitle">‘There is a singularity in our past’</p>
<p class="noindent"><span><span class="small">PENROSE’S DISCOVERY THAT</span></span> a star of great enough mass undergoing gravitational collapse must form a singularity set fire to Hawking. With Robert Geroch and Penrose, he began to extend ideas about singularities to other physical and mathematical cases.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch6ref1" id="rch6ref1">1</a></sup> He was certain the discovery had significant implications for the beginning of the universe. This was exhilarating work, with the ‘glorious feeling of having a whole field virtually to ourselves’.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch6ref2" id="rch6ref2">2</a></sup> Hawking realized that if he reversed the direction of time so that the collapse became an expansion, everything in Penrose’s theory would still hold. If general relativity tells us that any star that collapses beyond a certain point must end in a singularity, then it also tells us that any expanding universe must have <em class="calibre1">begun</em> as a singularity. For this to be true the universe must be like what scientists call a Friedmann model. What is a Friedmann model of the universe?</p>
<p class="h" id="page107">A Choice of Universes</p>
<p class="noindent">Before Hubble demonstrated that the universe is expanding, belief in a static universe (one that isn’t changing in size) was very strong, so much so that when Einstein produced his theory of general relativity in 1915, and that theory predicted the universe was not static, Einstein was so sure it was static that he revised his theory. He put in a ‘cosmological constant’ to balance gravity. Without this cosmological constant the theory of general relativity predicted what we now know to be true: the universe is changing in size.</p>
<p class="indent">A Russian physicist, Alexander Friedmann, decided to take Einstein’s theory at face value without the cosmological constant. Doing so, he predicted what Hubble would discover in 1929: The universe is expanding.</p>
<p class="indent">Friedmann began with two assumptions: (1) the universe looks much the same in whatever direction you look (except for nearby things like the shape of our Milky Way galaxy and our solar system); (2) the universe looks like this from wherever you are in the universe. In other words, no matter where you travel in space, the universe <em class="calibre1">still</em> looks much the same in whatever direction you look.</p>
<p class="indent">Friedmann’s first assumption is fairly easy to accept. The second isn’t. We don’t have any scientific evidence for or against it. Hawking says, ‘We believe it only on grounds of modesty: it would be most remarkable if the universe looked the same in every direction around us, but not around other points in the universe!’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch6ref3" id="rch6ref3">3</a></sup> Perhaps remarkable, but not impossible, you may argue. Modesty seems no more logical a reason for believing something than pride. However, physicists tend to agree with Friedmann.</p>
<p class="indent">In Friedmann’s model of the universe all the galaxies <span id="page108">move</span> away from one another. The farther apart two galaxies are, the more rapidly they move away from one another. This agrees with what Hubble observed. According to Friedmann, wherever you travel in space you’ll still find all the galaxies moving away from you. In order to understand this, imagine an ant crawling on a balloon that has evenly spaced dots painted on it. You have to pretend the ant can’t see the dimension that would allow it to look ‘out’ from the surface. Nor is it aware that the balloon has an interior. The ant’s universe involves only the surface of the balloon. It looks the same in any direction. No matter where the ant crawls on the balloon, it sees as many dots ahead of it as behind. If the balloon is getting larger, the ant sees all the dots move away, no matter where it stands on the surface. The balloon ‘universe’ fits Friedmann’s two assumptions: it looks the same in all directions. It looks the same no matter where you are in it.</p>
<p class="indent">What else can we say about the balloon universe? It isn’t infinite in size. The surface has dimensions we can measure, like the surface of the Earth. No one would suggest that the surface of the Earth is infinite in size. However, it also has no boundaries, no ends. Regardless of where the ant crawls on the surface, it never comes up against any barrier, finds any end to the surface, or falls off an edge. It eventually gets back to where it started.</p>
<p class="indent">In Friedmann’s original model, space is like that, with three dimensions rather than two. Gravity bends space around on to itself. The universe is not infinite in size, but neither does it have any end, any boundary. A spaceship will never get to a place in space where the universe ends. That may be difficult to understand, because we tend to <span id="page109">think</span> of <em class="calibre1">infinite</em> as meaning ‘having no end’. The two do not have the same meaning.</p>
<p class="indent">Hawking points out that although the idea of circumnavigating the universe and ending up where you started makes great science fiction, it doesn’t work, at least with this Friedmann model. You’d have to break the speed limit of the universe (the speed of light) – which isn’t allowed – to get all the way around before the universe ends. It’s an extremely large balloon. We are extremely small ants.</p>
<p class="indent">Time in this Friedmann model, like space, isn’t infinite. It can be measured. Time, <em class="calibre1">unlike</em> space, <em class="calibre1">does</em> have boundaries: a beginning and an end. Look at <a href="../Text/chapter_006_split_001.html#ch6fig1">Figure 6.1a</a>. The distance between two galaxies at the beginning of time is zero. They move apart. The expansion is slow enough and there is enough mass in the universe so that eventually gravitational attraction stops the expansion and causes the universe to contract. The galaxies move towards each other again. At the end of time the distance between them is once again zero. That may be what our universe is like.</p>
<p class="indent"><a href="../Text/chapter_006_split_001.html#ch6fig1">Figures 6.1b</a> and <a href="../Text/chapter_006_split_001.html#ch6fig1">6.1c</a> show two other possible models that would also obey Friedmann’s assumptions (that the universe looks the same in every direction and that it looks the same from wherever you are in the universe). In <a href="../Text/chapter_006_split_001.html#ch6fig1">Figure 6.1b</a>, the expansion is much more rapid. Gravity can’t stop it, though it does slow it a little. In <a href="../Text/chapter_006_split_001.html#ch6fig1">Figure 6.1c</a>, the universe is expanding just fast enough not to collapse, but not as fast as in <a href="../Text/chapter_006_split_001.html#ch6fig1">Figure 6.1b</a>. The speed at which galaxies are moving apart grows smaller and smaller, but they always continue to move apart. If the universe is like either of these two models, space is infinite. It doesn’t curve back around on to itself.</p>
