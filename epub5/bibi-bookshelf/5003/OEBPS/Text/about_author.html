<p class="noindent">Kitty Ferguson first became acquainted with Stephen Hawking and his family when she and her husband and children lived in Cambridge in the late 1980s. Around that time she retired from her career as a professional singer and conductor and began writing and lecturing about science and scientists for readers and audiences with little or no scientific background. Her seven books have appeared to critical acclaim all over the world, in twenty-seven languages. In 2000 she worked with Hawking, helping edit his book <em class="calibre1">The Universe in a Nutshell</em>.</p>
<p class="noindent-ts">Kitty grew up in San Antonio, Texas, moved to New York City at the age of nineteen to study at the Juilliard School of Music, and lived for forty-eight years in New York City and Chester, New Jersey. She and her husband now divide their time between Cambridge and South Carolina. They have three grown children and two grandchildren.</p>
