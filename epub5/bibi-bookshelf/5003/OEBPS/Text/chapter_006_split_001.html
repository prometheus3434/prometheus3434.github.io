<p class="caption1"><em class="calibre1">Figure 6.1. Three models that obey Friedmann’s assumptions that the universe looks much the same in any direction we look, and the universe looks much the same from wherever you might be in the universe</em>.</p>
<p class="indent" id="page111">Which model fits our universe? Will the universe collapse some day or go on expanding for ever? It depends on how much mass there is in the universe: how many votes there are in the entire democracy. It will take much more mass than we presently observe to close the universe. That is a very simple statement of a more complicated issue, as you’ll see later.</p>
<p class="indent">Penrose’s theory about stars collapsing and becoming singularities only worked with a universe infinite in space that will go on expanding for ever (as in <a href="../Text/chapter_006_split_001.html#ch6fig1">Figures 6.1b</a> and <a href="../Text/chapter_006_split_001.html#ch6fig1">6.1c</a>), not collapse (as in <a href="../Text/chapter_006_split_001.html#ch6fig1">Figure 6.1a</a>). Hawking first set out to prove that a universe infinite in space not only would have singularities in black holes but also must have begun as a singularity. He was confident enough by the time he finished his thesis to write: ‘There is a singularity in our past.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch6ref4" id="rch6ref4">4</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">In 1968, Hawking’s and Penrose’s essay on the beginning of time won second place in the Gravity Research Foundation Awards, but the question still hung in the balance: what if Friedmann’s <em class="calibre1">first</em> model was correct, where the universe is not infinite in space and eventually recollapses (<a href="../Text/chapter_006_split_001.html#ch6fig1">Figure 6.1a</a>)? Must that sort of universe also have begun as a singularity? By 1970 Hawking and Penrose were able to show that it must have. Their definitive statement on the subject, in the 1970 <em class="calibre1">Proceedings of the Royal Society</em>,<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch6ref5" id="rch6ref5">5</a></sup> was a joint paper proving that if the universe obeys general relativity and fits <em class="calibre1">any</em> of the Friedmann models, and if there is as much matter in the universe as we observe, the universe must have begun as a singularity, where all the mass of the universe was compressed to infinite density, where spacetime curvature was infinite.</p>
<p class="indent" id="page112">Physical theories can’t really work with infinite numbers. When the theory of general relativity predicts a singularity of infinite density and infinite spacetime curvature, it’s also predicting its own breakdown. In fact, all our scientific theories break down at a singularity. We lose our ability to predict. We can’t use the laws of physics to say what would emerge from the singularity. It could be any sort of universe. And what about the question of what happened <em class="calibre1">before</em> the singularity? It’s not even clear that this question has any meaning.</p>
<p class="indent">A singularity at the beginning of the universe would mean that the beginning of the universe is beyond our science, beyond anything that claims to be a Theory of Everything. We would simply have to say, time began, because we observe that it did, and that in itself is a very big arbitrary element. A singularity is a door slammed in our faces.</p>
<p class="h">Bedtime Story</p>
<p class="noindent">Physicists are notorious for being eternally preoccupied with their physics. Even more than most of his colleagues, and partly as a consequence of his disability, Hawking was able to take his work with him anywhere, any time, because it was almost all done in his head. As Kip Thorne described it, he had developed a very unusual ability to manipulate mental images of objects, curves, surfaces, shapes, not merely in three dimensions but in spacetime’s four dimensions.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch6ref6" id="rch6ref6">6</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Typical of Hawking’s work mode was a bedtime discovery he described in his book <em class="calibre1">A Brief History of Time</em>: ‘One evening in November of 1970, shortly after the birth of my daughter, Lucy, I started to think about black <span id="page113">holes</span> as I was getting into bed. My disability makes this rather a slow process, so I had plenty of time.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch6ref7" id="rch6ref7">7</a></sup> Another physicist might have nipped over to his desk and scribbled some notes and equations, but Hawking made one of the most significant discoveries of his career in his head, got into bed, and lay awake for the rest of the night, eager for dawn to break so that he could phone Penrose and tell him about his new insight. Penrose, Hawking insists, <em class="calibre1">had</em> thought of it but had not realized the implications.</p>
<p class="indent">The idea that had struck Hawking was that a black hole can never get smaller because the area of an event horizon (the radius-of-no-return where escape velocity becomes greater than the speed of light) can never decrease.</p>
<p class="indent">To review briefly, a collapsing star reaches a radius where escape velocity is the speed of light. What happens to photons emitted by the star as it collapses past that radius? Gravity there is too strong to allow them to escape, but not strong enough to pull them into the black hole. They stay there, hovering. That radius is the event horizon. After that as the star continues to shrink, any photons it emits are drawn back in.</p>
<p class="indent">What Hawking realized was that the paths of light rays hovering at the event horizon cannot be paths of light rays that are approaching one another. Paths of light rays that approach one another would bash into one another and fall into the black hole, not hover. In order for the area of the event horizon to get smaller (and the black hole to get smaller), paths of light rays in the event horizon <em class="calibre1">would</em> have to approach one another. But, if they did, they would fall in, and the event horizon would <em class="calibre1">not</em> get smaller.</p>
<p class="indent">Another way of thinking about this is to realize that a <span id="page114">black</span> hole <em class="calibre1">can</em> get <em class="calibre1">larger</em>. The size of a black hole is determined by its mass, so a black hole gets larger any time anything new falls in and adds to that mass. If nothing can get <em class="calibre1">out</em> of a black hole, its mass can’t possibly decrease. A black hole can’t get smaller.</p>
<p class="indent">Hawking’s discovery became known as the second law of black hole dynamics: the area of the event horizon (the border of the black hole) can stay the same or increase but never decrease. If two or more black holes collide and form one black hole, the area of the new event horizon is as big as or bigger than the previous event horizons added together. A black hole can’t get smaller or be destroyed or divided into two black holes, no matter how hard it might get zapped. Hawking’s discovery had a familiar ring to it. It resembled another ‘second law’ in physics: the second law of thermodynamics, which is about entropy.</p>
<p class="indent">Entropy is the amount of disorder there is in a system. Disorder always increases, never decreases. An assembled jigsaw puzzle put carefully in a box might get jostled, mixing the pieces and spoiling the picture. But it would be very surprising if any jostling of the box caused a mess of unassembled pieces to fall into place and complete the puzzle picture. In our universe, entropy (disorder) always increases. Broken teacups never reassemble themselves. A messy room never straightens itself up.</p>
<p class="indent">Suppose you patch the teacup or tidy up the room. Something does become more ordered. Does entropy decrease? No. The mental and physical energy you burn in the process converts energy to a less useful form. That represents a decrease in the amount of order in the universe which outbalances any increase of order you achieved.</p>
<p class="indent" id="page115">There’s another way in which entropy resembles the event horizon of a black hole. When two systems join, the entropy of the combined system is as great as or greater than the entropy of the two systems added together. A familiar example describes gas molecules in a box. Think of them as little balls bouncing off one another and off the walls of the box. There’s a partition down the centre of the box. Half the box (one side of the partition) is filled with oxygen molecules. The other half is filled with nitrogen molecules. Remove the partition, and oxygen and nitrogen molecules start to mix. Soon there’s a fairly uniform mixture throughout both halves of the box, but that’s a less ordered state than when the partition was in place: entropy – disorder – has increased. (The second law of thermodynamics doesn’t always hold: there is the tiniest of chances, one in many millions of millions, that at some point the nitrogen molecules will be back in their half of the box and the oxygen molecules in the other.)</p>
<p class="indent">Suppose you toss the box of mixed-up molecules or anything else that has entropy into a convenient black hole. So much for that bit of entropy, you might think. The total amount of entropy outside the black hole is less than it was before. Have you managed to violate the second law? Someone might argue that the whole universe (inside and outside black holes) hasn’t lost any entropy. But the fact is that anything going into a black hole is just plain lost to our universe. Or is it?</p>
<p class="indent">One of John Wheeler’s graduate students at Princeton, Demetrios Christodoulou, pointed out that according to the second law of thermodynamics, the entropy (disorder) of a closed system always increases, never decreases, and that similarly the ‘irreducible mass’ (Christodoulou’s name <span id="page116">for</span> a mathematical combination between a black hole’s mass and its speed of rotation) never decreases, no matter what happens to the black hole. Was this resemblance only a coincidence? What connection could Christodoulou’s idea or Hawking’s more general and powerful statement<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch6ref8" id="rch6ref8">8</a></sup> (the never-decreasing area of the event horizon) have with entropy and the second law of thermodynamics?</p>
<p class="h">Escape from a Black Hole?</p>
<p class="noindent">In his first announcement to the scientific community of his idea about the event horizon of a black hole never getting smaller, in December 1970 at the Texas Symposium of Relativistic Astrophysics,<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch6ref9" id="rch6ref9">9</a></sup> Hawking insisted that though an increase in the area of the event horizon did indeed resemble an increase of entropy, this was only an analogy.</p>
<p class="indent">Another of Wheeler’s graduate students at Princeton, Jacob Bekenstein, begged to differ. Bekenstein insisted that the area of the event horizon of a black hole isn’t only <em class="calibre1">like</em> entropy; it <em class="calibre1">is</em> entropy.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch6ref10" id="rch6ref10">10</a></sup> When you measure the area of the event horizon, you’re measuring the entropy of the black hole. You don’t destroy entropy if you toss it into a black hole. The black hole already has entropy. You only increase it. When something falls into a black hole, such as a box of molecules, it adds to the mass of the black hole, and the event horizon gets larger. It also adds to the entropy of the black hole.</p>
<p class="indent">All of this brings us to a puzzling point. If something has entropy, that means it has a temperature. It is not totally cold. If something has a temperature, it has to be radiating energy. If something is radiating energy, you can’t say that nothing is coming out. Nothing was <span id="page117">supposed</span> to come out of black holes.</p>
<p class="indent">Hawking thought Bekenstein was mistaken. He was irritated by what he thought was Bekenstein’s misuse of his discovery that event horizons never decrease. In 1972 and 1973 he joined forces with two other physicists, James Bardeen and Brandon Carter, and seemed to tread close to a concession by coming up with no fewer than four laws of black hole mechanics that appeared to be almost identical to the four well-known laws of thermodynamics ‘if one only replaced the phrase “horizon area” with “entropy,” and the phrase “horizon surface gravity” with “temperature”’.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch6ref11" id="rch6ref11">11</a></sup> Nevertheless the three authors continued to stress that these were only analogies, and in the final version of their paper<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch6ref12" id="rch6ref12">12</a></sup> reiterated that their four laws of black hole mechanics were similar to, but distinct from, the four laws of thermodynamics. Although there were many similarities between entropy and the area of the event horizon, a black hole could not have entropy because it could not emit anything. That was an argument that Bekenstein could not gainsay, but even though he was a graduate student up against a trio of established physicists, he was not convinced. It turned out that Hawking, Bardeen and Carter were wrong. It would fall to Hawking himself to show how.</p>
<p class="indent">In 1962 when Hawking had begun his graduate studies at Cambridge, he’d chosen cosmology, the study of the very large, rather than quantum mechanics, the study of the very small. Now, in 1973, he decided to shift ground and look at black holes through the eyes of quantum mechanics. It was to be the first serious, successful attempt by anybody to fuse the two great theories of the twentieth century: relativity and quantum mechanics. <span id="page118">Such</span> a fusion, you’ll remember from <a href="../Text/chapter_002.html">Chapter 2</a>, is a difficult hurdle on the road to a Theory of Everything.</p>
<p class="indent">In January 1973, Hawking was thirty-one years old. The new year brought the publication of his first full-length book, co-authored with George Ellis and dedicated to Denis Sciama. Hawking describes <em class="calibre1">The Large Scale Structure of Space-Time</em> as ‘highly technical, and quite unreadable’.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch6ref13" id="rch6ref13">13</a></sup> It still appears on the shelves of academic bookshops, and if you pull it down, and are not an accomplished physicist, you will probably agree with him. Although it will never match the sales of <em class="calibre1">A Brief History of Time</em>, it has become a classic in the field.</p>
<p class="indent">In August and September of that year, during Cambridge’s long vacation, Stephen and Jane Hawking travelled to Warsaw for the celebration of the 500th anniversary of the birth of Nicolaus Copernicus, and continued east from there to Moscow. They asked Kip Thorne to go with them, because he had been carrying on joint research with Soviet physicists for five years and knew the ropes in the Soviet Union. Hawking wanted to confer with Yakov Borisovich Zel’dovich and Zel’dovich’s graduate student Alexander Starobinsky. These two Russian physicists had been able to show that the uncertainty principle meant that rotating black holes would create and emit particles, produced by the hole’s rotational energy. The radiation would come from just outside the event horizon and would slow down the black hole’s rotation until the rotation stopped and the radiation ceased. Hawking thought Zel’dovich and Starobinsky were on to something, but he wasn’t satisfied with their calculations. After the visit he returned to Cambridge determined to devise a better mathematical treatment.</p>
<p class="indent" id="page119">Hawking expected his calculations to show that rotating black holes produce the radiation the Russians predicted. What he discovered was something far more dramatic: ‘I found, to my surprise and annoyance, that even nonrotating black holes should apparently create and emit particles at a steady rate.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch6ref14" id="rch6ref14">14</a></sup> At first he thought something had to be wrong with his calculations and he spent many hours trying to find his error. He was particularly eager that Jacob Bekenstein should not find out about his discovery and use it as an argument supporting his idea about event horizons and entropy. But the more Hawking thought about it, the more he had to admit that his own calculations were certainly not far off the mark. The clincher was that the spectrum of the emitted particles was precisely what you’d expect from any hot body.</p>
<p class="indent">Bekenstein was right: You cannot make entropy decrease and the universe get more orderly by throwing matter carrying entropy into black holes as though they were great rubbish bins. As matter carrying entropy goes into a black hole, the area of the event horizon gets larger: the entropy of the black hole increases. The total entropy of the universe both inside and outside black holes hasn’t become any less.</p>
<p class="indent">But Hawking was on to a bigger puzzle now. How can black holes possibly have a temperature and emit particles if nothing can escape past the event horizon? He found the answer in quantum mechanics.</p>
<p class="indent">When we think of space as a vacuum, we haven’t got it quite right. We’ve already seen that space is never a complete vacuum. Now we’ll find out why.</p>
<p class="indent">The uncertainty principle means we can never know both the position and the momentum of a particle at the <span id="page120">same</span> time with complete accuracy. It means something more than that: we can never know both the value of a field (a gravitational field or an electromagnetic field, for instance) and the rate at which the field is changing over time with complete accuracy. The more precisely we know the value of a field, the less precisely we know the rate of change, and vice versa: the seesaw again. The upshot is that a field can never measure zero. Zero would be a very precise measurement of both the value of the field and its rate of change, and the uncertainty principle won’t allow that. You don’t have empty space unless all fields are exactly zero: no zero – no empty space.</p>
<p class="indent">Instead of the empty space, the true vacuum, that most of us assume is out there, we have a minimum amount of uncertainty, a bit of fuzziness, as to just what the value of a field is in ‘empty’ space. One way to think of this fluctuation in the value of the field, this wobbling a bit towards the positive and negative sides of zero so as never to be zero, is as follows:</p>
<p class="indent">Pairs of particles – pairs of photons or gravitons, for instance – continually appear. The two particles in a pair start out together then move apart. After an interval of time too short to imagine they come together again and annihilate one another – a brief but eventful life. Quantum mechanics tells us this is happening all the time, everywhere in the ‘vacuum’ of space. These may not be ‘real’ particles that we can detect with a particle detector, but they are not imaginary. Even if they are only ‘virtual’ particles, we know they exist because we can measure their effects on other particles.</p>
<p class="indent">Some of the pairs will be pairs of <em class="calibre1">matter</em> particles, fermions. In this case, one of the pair is an antiparticle. ‘Antimatter’, <span id="page121">familiar</span> from fantasy games and science fiction (it drives the starship <em class="calibre1">Enterprise</em>), isn’t purely fictional.</p>
<p class="indent">You may have heard that the total amount of energy in the universe always stays the same. There cannot be any suddenly appearing from nowhere. How do we get around that rule with these newly created pairs? They’re created by a very temporary ‘borrowing’ of energy. Nothing permanent at all. One of the pair has positive energy. The other has negative energy. The two balance out. Nothing is added to the total energy of the universe.</p>
<p class="indent">Hawking reasoned that there will be many particle pairs popping up at the event horizon of a black hole. The way he pictures it, a pair of virtual particles appears. Before the pair meet again and annihilate, the one with negative energy crosses the event horizon into the black hole. Does that mean the positive energy partner must follow its unfortunate companion in order to meet and annihilate? No. The gravitational field at the event horizon of a black hole is strong enough to do an astounding thing to virtual particles, even those unfortunates with negative energy: it can change them from ‘virtual’ to ‘real’.</p>
<p class="indent">The transformation makes a remarkable difference to the pair. They are no longer obliged to find one another and annihilate. They can both live much longer, and separately. The particle with positive energy might fall into the black hole, too, of course, but it doesn’t have to. It’s free of the partnership. It can escape. To an observer at a distance it appears to come out of the black hole. In fact, it comes from just outside. Meanwhile, its partner has carried negative energy into the black hole (<a href="../Text/chapter_006_split_001.html#ch6fig2">Figure 6.2</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The radiation that’s emitted by black holes in this manner is now called Hawking radiation. And with Hawking radiation, his second famous discovery about black holes, Hawking showed that his first famous discovery, the second law of black hole dynamics (that the area of the event horizon can never decrease), doesn’t always hold. Hawking radiation means that a black hole might get smaller and eventually evaporate entirely. It was a truly radical concept.</p>
<div class="centered-image1" id="page122"><a id="ch6fig2"/><img alt="Hawking radiation" class="imagefix9" src="../Images/f0122-01.jpg"/></div>
<p class="caption1"><em class="calibre1">Figure 6.2. Hawking radiation</em></p>
<p class="indent" id="page123">How does Hawking radiation make a black hole get smaller? As the black hole transforms virtual particles to real particles, it loses energy. How can this happen, if nothing escapes through the event horizon? How can it lose anything? It’s rather a trick answer: when the particle with negative energy carries this <em class="calibre1">negative</em> energy into the black hole, that makes <em class="calibre1">less</em> energy in the black hole. Negative means ‘minus’, which means less.</p>
<p class="indent">That’s how Hawking radiation robs the black hole of energy. When something has less energy, it automatically has less mass. Remember Albert Einstein’s equation, <em class="calibre1">E</em> = <em class="calibre1">mc</em><sup class="calibre3">2</sup>. The <em class="calibre1">E</em> stands for energy, the <em class="calibre1">m</em> for mass, the <em class="calibre1">c</em> for the speed of light. When the energy (on one side of the equal sign) grows less (as it is doing in the black hole), something on the other side of the equal sign grows less too. The speed of light (<em class="calibre1">c</em>) can’t change. It must be the mass that grows less. So, when we say a black hole is robbed of energy, we’re also saying it’s robbed of mass.</p>
<p class="indent">Keep this in mind and recall what Newton discovered about gravity: any change in the mass of a body changes the amount of gravitational pull it exerts on another body. If the Earth becomes less massive (not smaller this time, less massive), its gravitational pull feels weaker out where the moon is orbiting. If a black hole loses mass, its gravitational pull becomes weaker out where the event horizon (the radius-of-no-return) has been. Escape velocity at that radius becomes less than the speed of light. There is now a smaller radius where escape velocity is the speed of light. A new event horizon forms closer in. The event horizon has shrunk. This is the only way we know that a black hole can get smaller.</p>
<p class="indent" id="page124">If we measure Hawking radiation from a large black hole, one resulting from the collapse of a star, we’ll be disappointed. A black hole this size has a surface temperature of less than a millionth of a degree above absolute zero. The larger the black hole the lower the temperature. Hawking says, ‘Our 10-solar-mass black hole might emit a few thousand photons a second, but they would have a wavelength the size of the black hole and so little energy we would not be able to detect them.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch6ref15" id="rch6ref15">15</a></sup> The way it works is that the greater the mass, the greater the area of the event horizon. The greater the area of the event horizon, the greater the entropy. The greater the entropy, the lower the surface temperature and the rate of emission.</p>
<p class="h">Exploding Black Holes?</p>
<p class="noindent">However, as early as 1971 Hawking had suggested that there was a second type of black hole: tiny ones, the most interesting ones about the size of the nucleus of an atom. These would positively crackle with radiation. The smaller a black hole is, the hotter its surface temperature. Referring to these tiny black holes, Hawking declares: ‘Such holes hardly deserve [to be called] <em class="calibre1">black</em>: they really are <em class="calibre1">white hot</em>.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch6ref16" id="rch6ref16">16</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">‘Primordial black holes’, as Hawking called them, would not have formed from the collapse of stars. They would be relics of the very early universe when there were pressures that could press matter together extremely tightly. A primordial black hole would by now be much smaller even than when it started out. It’s been losing mass for a long time.</p>
<p class="indent">Hawking radiation would have drastic consequences for a primordial black hole. As the mass grows less and the <span id="page125">black</span> hole gets smaller, the temperature and rate of emission of particles at the event horizon increase. The hole loses mass more and more quickly. The lower the mass, the higher the temperature – a vicious circle!</p>
<p class="indent">How would the story end? Hawking guessed that the little black hole disappears in a huge final puff of particle emission, like millions of hydrogen bombs exploding. Will a large black hole ever explode? Some models have it that the universe will come to an end long before it reaches that stage.</p>
<p class="indent">The idea that a black hole could get smaller and finally explode was so much the reverse of everything anybody thought about black holes in 1973 that Hawking had grave doubts about his discovery. For weeks he kept it under wraps, reviewing the calculations in his head. If he found it so hard to believe, it was fearful to predict what the rest of the scientific world would make of it. No scientist enjoys the prospect of ridicule. On the other hand, Hawking knew that if he was right, his findings would revolutionize astrophysics. At one point he locked himself in the bathroom to think about the problem. ‘I worried about this all over Christmas, but I couldn’t find any convincing way to get rid of [these findings].’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch6ref17" id="rch6ref17">17</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Hawking tested his idea on his close associates. The reception was mixed. Martin Rees, a friend since their days as graduate students at Cambridge, approached their old thesis supervisor, Denis Sciama, with the exclamation, ‘Have you heard? Stephen’s changed everything!’ Sciama rallied to Hawking’s support, urging him to release his findings. Hawking complained that Penrose phoned him, full of enthusiasm, just as he was sitting down to his 1974 birthday dinner, ready to tuck into his <span id="page126">goose</span>. He appreciated Penrose’s excitement, Hawking said, but, once into the subject, they talked too long. His dinner got cold.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch6ref18" id="rch6ref18">18</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Hawking agreed to present his bizarre discovery in February in a paper at the Rutherford–Appleton Laboratory south of Oxford. Sciama was the organizer of the meeting, the Second Quantum Gravity Conference. Hawking had hedged his bets a little by putting a question mark in the title of his paper, ‘Black Hole Explosions?’, but, travelling to Oxford, he still agonized over his decision to announce his discovery.</p>
<p class="indent">The short presentation, including slides of equations, was greeted with silence that became embarrassing, and few questions. Hawking’s arguments had gone over the heads of many in the audience, experts in other fields. But it was more or less obvious to everyone that he was proposing something completely contrary to accepted theory. Those who did understand were shocked and unprepared to argue with him. The lights were snapped back on. The moderator, John G. Taylor, a respected professor from the University of London, rose and declared: ‘Sorry, Stephen, but this is absolute rubbish.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch6ref19" id="rch6ref19">19</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Hawking published this ‘rubbish’ the next month in the prestigious science magazine <em class="calibre1">Nature</em>.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch6ref20" id="rch6ref20">20</a></sup> Taylor and Paul C. W. Davies disagreed with Hawking in a paper in the same issue.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch6ref21" id="rch6ref21">21</a></sup> Within a few days physicists all over the world were discussing Hawking’s shocking idea. Zel’dovich had reservations at first, but when Kip Thorne was next in Moscow he had an urgent summons to visit the Soviet physicist. When Thorne arrived, Zel’dovich and Starobinsky greeted him with hands in the air, as <span id="page127">though</span> they were in the old American West and Thorne had them at gunpoint: ‘We give in. Hawking was right. We were wrong.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch6ref22" id="rch6ref22">22</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Some were calling Hawking’s discovery the most significant in theoretical physics in years. Sciama said the paper was ‘one of the most beautiful in the history of physics’.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch6ref23" id="rch6ref23">23</a></sup> John Wheeler, always a master with words, said that talking about Hawking’s beautiful discovery was like ‘rolling candy on the tongue’.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch6ref24" id="rch6ref24">24</a></sup> Kip Thorne commented that as Stephen had lost the use of his hands he had developed ‘geometrical arguments that he could do pictorially in his head … a very powerful set of tools that nobody else really had. And if you are the only master in the world of these new tools, that means there are certain kinds of problems you can solve and nobody else can.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch6ref25" id="rch6ref25">25</a></sup> Things were certainly looking up.</p>
<p class="indent">Hawking took more time and care putting together a second paper about his discovery. <em class="calibre1">Communications in Mathematical Physics</em>, the journal to which he submitted it in March 1974, lost his paper and didn’t publish it until April 1975,<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch6ref26" id="rch6ref26">26</a></sup> after he resubmitted it. In the meantime, Hawking and his colleagues went on studying ‘Hawking radiation’ from many different angles. By the time the next four years had passed – and after a joint paper written by Hawking and Jim Hartle appeared in 1976<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch6ref27" id="rch6ref27">27</a></sup> – Hawking radiation had been generally accepted throughout the theoretical physics world. Most agreed that Hawking had made a significant breakthrough. He had used the activity of virtual particles to explain about something that had arisen from the theory of relativity – black holes. He’d taken a step towards linking relativity and quantum physics.</p>
