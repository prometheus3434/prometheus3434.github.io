<p class="chaptitle">‘Is the end in sight for theoretical physics?’</p>
<p class="noindent"><span><span class="small">THE BUILDING THAT</span></span> housed the University of Cambridge Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics from the middle of the twentieth century until 2000 was a grimy behemoth of no architectural distinction whatsoever. One had to conclude that those who worked there happily had to be pretty much oblivious to their surroundings or just loved the old place for other than aesthetic reasons.</p>
<p class="indent">The entrance was off Silver Street through a narrow alleyway, an asphalt car park and a red door. The interior of the building was institutional; the floor plan pieced together illogically. A corridor beyond a small reception area made an abrupt right turn past an ancient black metal lift, continued straight for a while, then bent and widened past letterboxes and overstuffed bulletin boards with lecture and seminar notices and some lewd graffiti, narrowed again abruptly, and ended at the door of a large common room.</p>
<p class="indent" id="page266">For decades, it was in this common room that the DAMTP gathered for tea every afternoon at four. For most of the day the room was deserted and dimly lighted. The colour scheme showed a preference for lime green – in vinyl armchairs grouped around low tables, woodwork and the lower halves of the pillars supporting the high ceiling. There was a table with stacks of scientific publications, a rogues’ gallery of small photos of present students and faculty on one wall, and formal portraits of former Lucasian professors on another. At the far end of the room enormous windows provided a view of a blank wall across the alley and admitted little light.</p>
<p class="indent">Hawking’s office and a number of others opened off this common room. On his door there was a small placard: ‘<span><span class="small">QUIET PLEASE, THE BOSS IS ASLEEP</span></span>’. Probably not true. Hawking spent long hours, over the years, working in that pleasant, high-ceilinged office with his computers, photos of his children, a few plants, a life-size picture of Marilyn Monroe on the door and always, after 1985, one of his nurses in attendance. His one oversized window overlooked the car park.</p>
<p class="indent">Hawking’s day there usually began at 11 a.m. His secretary reviewed his schedule with him. In the late 1980s, that became something of a joke. They seldom managed to follow it, and anyone who had an appointment with Hawking had to remain flexible.</p>
<p class="indent">The day continued with the soft clicking of his hand-held pressure switch. Propped in his chair, Hawking watched the computer screen impassively and selected words to communicate with visitors and interviewers, consult colleagues, advise students, converse over the telephone, write lectures or answer correspondence. <span id="page267">Sometimes</span> you heard the soft hum of his wheelchair motor as he guided it by means of a joystick through the common room and corridors to other rooms in the building for meetings and seminars. A nurse went with him. At intervals the well-modulated computer voice requested his nurse to adjust his position in the chair or suction fluid that accumulates in his breathing passage.</p>
<p class="indent">Hawking’s nursing staff in the late 1980s was large and competent and varied as to age and sex. They seemed indulgently fond of Hawking and devoted to the task of making him look nice, keeping his hair brushed, his glasses clean, his chin wiped of the saliva that runs from his mouth, and, as they put it, to ‘getting him sorted out’ many times a day. Hawking had no choice but to be totally dependent on others, but there was never any air of helplessness about him. On the contrary he was vigorous and decisive, unquestionably in charge of his life. His staff said that the strength of his personality made working for him and with him both rewarding and demanding. I was never aware of the unpleasant competition among the nurses that Jane Hawking would later write about.</p>
<p class="indent">In the late eighties the mail had become an impossible burden for Hawking’s research assistant, his personal assistant Sue Masey and one of his nurses who now helped them. They were struggling valiantly to write thoughtful answers to letters, poems, videotapes from all over the world, many of which told moving stories and deserved a personal response. It was sad to have to resort increasingly to polite preprinted postcards, but it would have taken all Hawking’s waking hours to handle even a fraction of his mail.</p>
<p class="indent">At 1 p.m., rain or shine, Hawking would propel his <span id="page268">wheelchair</span> with portable computer attached out into the narrow Cambridge streets, sometimes accompanied only by a nurse, sometimes by students, who trotted to keep up with him. It was a short journey through the heart of Cambridge, past the up-market shops in King’s Parade, King’s College Chapel and the Senate House, to Gonville and Caius, to lunch with other Fellows of his college. There a nurse arranged a bib around his shoulders and spooned food into his mouth. Eating was no deterrent to conversation for Hawking, whose finger moved continually on his hand-held device, choosing words to talk with those near him.</p>
<p class="indent">After lunch there was the return journey to the DAMTP. By then Hawking was notorious on at least two continents for his hair-raising wheelchair driving. Students would bound ahead into traffic on King’s Parade and Silver Street to stop cars, lorries and bicycles as he recklessly barrelled ahead assuming the right of way. Acquaintances feared he was more likely to be crushed by a lorry than die from ALS.</p>
<p class="indent">At 4 p.m. Hawking would emerge again from behind his lime green door. Teatime was a ritual in the department, and the empty, cavernous room would become suddenly deafeningly noisy with voices and the clatter of teacups. Most of the assembled physicists and mathematicians dressed as though they were on a construction site. Someone has commented that Hawking’s ‘relativity group’ looked like a rock group on a bad day. Their talk wasn’t small talk. It ranged among wormholes, Euclidean regions, scalar fields and black holes. Equations were scrawled on the low tables. Hawking’s wry wit set the tone in his corner of the room, but former students claim <span id="page269">that</span> a few remarks from him during tea were often more valuable than an hour’s lecture by somebody else. Hawking had mastered the art of packing a lot into a few words. Reading over notes later, you realized how precisely he had chosen his words to say exactly what he meant.</p>
<p class="indent">At four thirty the common room would empty as rapidly as it had filled, and all but one of the long, fluorescent lighting fixtures were switched off. Hawking would glide back into his office to work until seven. In the late afternoon his students found him more available to help them.</p>
<p class="indent">On some evenings Hawking dined in college, or, in a specially equipped van bought with award money from the 1988 Israeli Wolf Prize in physics, he would be driven to a concert or the theatre. When there was a concert at Tim’s school, he would go to hear Tim play the cello with the orchestra. Tim was a good cellist, following in the footsteps of his sister Lucy. On other evenings Hawking would work late in his office.</p>
<p class="indent">It was on one of those late evenings, in December 1989, that I went in to talk with him about plans for writing my first book about him. We discussed black holes and I read him a paragraph I’d written to make sure I had it right. When I paused to complain that my writing sounded dull because my editor was opposed to any fun or humour in a book about science, Hawking said, ‘It should be fun. Tell him I said so.’ I was certain this <em class="calibre1">would</em> win the argument with my editor. After all, Hawking’s own book was flying off the shelves and had sold millions of copies. At one point, as I watched the words flit across the screen, I was startled that the message was ‘Would you <span id="page270">please</span> pull me up a little higher in my chair?’ Realizing after a moment of confusion that this wasn’t meant for me, I glanced over at the young male nurse sitting near us. He came to life, picked up Hawking and set him down in a better position.</p>
<p class="indent">By the end of my visit that evening we had sorted out plans. Hawking would tell his personal assistant to supply me with childhood and family photographs and with material he had written about his childhood and his disability that had never been published. In May or June, when I had completed the science sections of the book, he would go over those with me.</p>
<p class="h">The precipice gives way</p>
<p class="noindent">Life at the focus of as much attention and adulation as Hawking was receiving inevitably takes on an unnatural cast. It isn’t easy to keep things in perspective, no matter how levelheaded and grown-up you are or how good a sense of humour you have about yourself. For a quarter of a century Hawking had been convincing people that he was not subhuman. He’d succeeded too well. He’d convinced them he was superhuman. He had never deliberately encouraged this idea. He said he refused to be treated as less <em class="calibre1">or more</em> than simply human. But critics pointed out that he’d actually done precious little to discourage the superhero image. To be fair, who would have? It was fun and it sold books. Besides, what good did it do to try to discourage it? When he made statements like ‘I get embarrassed when people call it courage; I’ve just done the only thing open to me in the situation’,<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch13ref1" id="rch13ref1">1</a></sup> some took it as false modesty and others as one more example of heroism.</p>
<p class="indent" id="page271">Hawking began openly shouldering, more than previously, the responsibility of being a role model for disabled people. In a speech before an occupational science conference at the University of Southern California in June 1990 he sounded almost militant. ‘It is very important that disabled children should be helped to blend with others of the same age. It determines their self-image. How can one feel a member of the human race if one is set apart from an early age? It is a form of apartheid.’ He said he counted himself lucky that his disease struck him fairly late, after he’d spent his childhood with able-bodied friends, engaged in normal physical games. He praised the mechanical advances that have helped him. But he went on to say that although ‘aids like wheelchairs and computers can play an important role in overcoming physical deficiencies, the right mental attitude is even more important. It is no use complaining about the public’s attitude about the disabled. It is up to disabled people to change people’s awareness in the same way that blacks and women have changed public perceptions.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch13ref2" id="rch13ref2">2</a></sup> Even Hawking’s critics couldn’t deny that he had gone further than almost anyone else in history towards changing that awareness.</p>
<p class="indent">While Hawking ranged all over the world giving talks, receiving honours, holding press conferences, and enjoying the general adulation, more and more frequently accompanied by Elaine Mason, Cambridge friends watched their ‘resident supercelebrity’ with indulgence and delight, but also with mounting concern. They begrudged him none of the fun, but they worried about him. Was he beginning to believe the ‘master of the universe’ image? Would celebrity crowd out his scientific <span id="page272">work</span>? Mixed with his natural stubbornness, was it making him a wilful prima donna? Would an exalted self-image affect his family? Would the marriage that had endured so much adversity be able to survive? The public likes to own its heroes. Could Stephen ever be just Stephen again? It seemed unlikely.</p>
<p class="indent">Jane Hawking’s relationship with Jonathan Hellyer Jones was still known to only a handful of very discreet people and news of it had not reached the wider world or the media – an astounding achievement in a town and university community as small as Cambridge. However, Jane had sounded an ominous note in an interview in 1989: ‘I started with great optimism. Stephen was then infected with that optimism. His determination has now rather outstripped mine. I cannot keep up with him. I do think he tends to overcompensate for his condition by doing absolutely everything that comes to his notice.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch13ref3" id="rch13ref3">3</a></sup> That ‘everything’ had grown out of all proportion. Jane felt it was a tremendous victory that he was able to live at home and have a fairly normal life. Stephen Hawking wanted much more. There were more doors open to him, more possibilities, than he had ever dreamed of or could ever hope to explore; more demands on his time than he could ever hope to meet.</p>
<p class="indent">All these activities and the adulation and awards were distancing him from his family. Increasingly they were carving out lives of their own, separate from his. Robert and Lucy were actively trying to be independent and move out of his shadow. Jane rarely accompanied him in his travels and public appearances. She sought escape in her teaching and her garden and in books and music. Her voice lessons had borne fruit and she had become a valued <span id="page273">member</span> of a top-flight Cambridge choir, often singing soprano solos. There were other friends besides Jonathan who shared her religious faith. Her role in Stephen’s life had changed. It was, she said, no longer to encourage a sick husband. It was ‘simply to tell him that he’s not God’.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch13ref4" id="rch13ref4">4</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">For twenty-five years Stephen and Jane Hawking together seemed to nearly everyone to have handled adversity magnificently. Again and again Stephen had spoken of their relationship as the mainstay of his life and his success. The <em class="calibre1">Master of the Universe</em> television special in 1989 ended with a picture of the two of them watching their sleeping child, Tim, and Hawking saying, ‘One really can’t ask for more.’ The Hawkings’ public image had continued to reaffirm that life on the edge of the precipice was, for all its problems, a beautiful life.</p>
<p class="indent">In the spring of 1990 the precipice that had been weakening from within for several years crumbled in a way few people had ever expected it would. What had seemed to me a fairly smoothly humming operation on Silver Street when I talked with Hawking the previous December had become, when I visited again with my completed science chapters in the early summer of 1990, frenetic and unhappy. I spent a week conversing with Hawking and having him vet my chapters, aware that for some reason the mood in the department, especially among the staff and those faculty members closest to him, and with Hawking himself, was tense, on a knife edge.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, a mutual friend who knew Jane Hawking well cleared up the mystery. Stephen had told Jane that he was leaving her for Elaine Mason. Even with media attention bordering on paparazzi, the Hawkings had kept their <span id="page274">secrets</span> so well that I, who had been interviewing him and was writing a book about him, could hardly believe the news. It seemed a tragic end to what most had thought was a beautiful, heroic marriage. To stalwarts who had been closest to Hawking the break-up had been no surprise. A couple of his most trusted staff had resigned, unwilling to deal with the turmoil of his disintegrating marriage and his new relationship with Elaine. Sue Masey was struggling to keep things moving ahead on an even keel.</p>
<p class="indent">The Hawkings separated just short of their twenty-fifth wedding anniversary. Except for a brief mention to the press that autumn that he had left his wife but did not rule out the possibility of a reconciliation, neither Stephen nor Jane Hawking made any public statement. It was symptomatic of the love and respect Hawking’s friends and colleagues have for him that in a town where gossip moves like wildfire the news was very slow in spreading. As it did, a widening circle of acquaintances in Cambridge and all over the world reacted to it as a tragedy. The disintegration of marriages was commonplace, but Hawking and the Hawking marriage had seemed so very un-commonplace. At first, opinion turned strongly against him for leaving the wife who had supported him so courageously. Not until Jane Hawking published her memoirs in the late 1990s did a more balanced picture emerge, and it finally became known that the marriage had, in truth, been troubled for years.</p>
<p class="indent">Hawking moved out of the house on West Road, and he and Elaine took up residence in Pinehurst, an attractive, upmarket, rather secluded cluster of homes and flats not far away in Grange Road. In the early nineties <span id="page275">Elaine</span> sometimes skateboarded back to that home after delivering her boys to school.</p>
<p class="indent">Hawking had relinquished one of the pillars he had always said supported his life: his family. Was another such pillar, his scientific work, also in danger of collapse?</p>
<p class="h">The Lucasian Lecture – Revisited</p>
<p class="noindent">Though some feared the personal turmoil in Hawking’s life would undermine his scientific work, he continued to express his devotion to his science. He said he was ‘itching to get on with it’. Was it still possible that he might be the physicist to fit it all together in the Theory of Everything, as the media had been prophesying?</p>
<p class="indent">Hawking’s work wasn’t in the newer mainstream of that effort: superstring theory. However, mainstreams in physics shift overnight, and a mind somewhat set apart may spot the connection that makes several streams converge into one complete theory. There were murmurs that by theoretical physics standards Hawking was already well over the hill. It’s young people who usually make the great discoveries. A freshness of mind is required, a passionate, brash approach mixed with a certain amount of naivety. But Hawking certainly still had all of that. It would have been a profound mistake to rule him out on those grounds.</p>
<p class="indent">Would he live long enough? His illness was still progressing but very slowly. Did he worry about dying before he finishes his work? In 1990 he replied to that question by saying that he never looks that far ahead. He’s lived with the possibility of imminent death for so long that he isn’t afraid of it. The kind of work he does is a joint effort, and there are plenty of other physicists to carry on with it. <span id="page276">He’s</span> never claimed his presence is necessary for the Theory of Everything to be found. ‘But I’m in no hurry to die,’ he added. ‘There’s a lot I want to do first.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch13ref5" id="rch13ref5">5</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">In June 1990, ten years after his inaugural lecture as Lucasian Professor, I asked him how he would change his Lucasian lecture, were he to write it over again. <em class="calibre1">Is</em> the end in sight for theoretical physics? Yes, he said. But not by the end of the century. The most promising candidate to unify the forces and particles was no longer the N=8 supergravity he’d spoken of then. It was superstrings, the theory that was explaining the fundamental objects of the universe as tiny, vibrating strings, and proposing that what we had been thinking of as particles are, instead, different ways a fundamental loop of string can vibrate. Superstrings would take a little longer to work out. Give it twenty or twenty-five years, he said.</p>
<p class="indent">I asked him whether he believed his no-boundary proposal might turn out to answer the question, what are the boundary conditions of the universe? He answered yes.</p>
<p class="indent">Hawking said he thought wormhole theory had important implications for a Theory of Everything. Because of wormholes it was probable that neither superstrings nor any other theory would be able to predict such fundamental numbers in the universe as particle charges and masses.</p>
<p class="indent">And if somebody does find the Theory of Everything, what then? According to Hawking, doing physics after that would be like mountaineering after Mount Everest has been conquered. However, Hawking had also said in <em class="calibre1">A Brief History of Time</em> that for humanity as a whole it would be only the beginning, because, although a Theory of Everything would tell us how the universe works and why it is the way <span id="page277">it</span> is, it won’t tell us why it exists at all. It would be just a set of rules and equations. He had wondered: ‘What is it that breathes fire into the equations and makes a universe for them to describe?’ ‘Why does the universe go to all the bother of existing?’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch13ref6" id="rch13ref6">6</a></sup> Those, he said, are questions that the usual scientific approach of coming up with mathematical models cannot answer.</p>
<p class="indent">Hawking still longed to know the answers. ‘If I knew that, then I would know everything important’,<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch13ref7" id="rch13ref7">7</a></sup> ‘then we would know the mind of God’.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch13ref8" id="rch13ref8">8</a></sup> That was where he had left it at the end of his book, but he had told a television interviewer: ‘I’m not so optimistic about finding why the universe exists.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch13ref9" id="rch13ref9">9</a></sup> He wasn’t considering the question of whether we necessarily need to find the Theory of Everything in order to know the mind of God, whether there are, as Jane Hawking had suggested, other ways to know God besides in the laws of science.</p>
<p class="h">Stardom</p>
<p class="noindent">In 1990 Hawking received an honorary degree from Harvard University. Those who attended the ceremony and reception remember with fondness that Hawking’s fellow honoree Ella Fitzgerald sang especially for him at the reception.</p>
<p class="indent">New non-academic faces were showing up outside Hawking’s door to read the little plaque, and were being made to wait just as though they were graduate students there for a supervision. It wasn’t a local Cambridge or New York photographer, but Francis Giacobetti, photographer of the Pope and Federico Fellini, whose equipment and assistants crowded that side of the common room. Giacobetti believed the subjects of his <span id="page278">portraits</span> were best revealed by their hands, the irises of their eyes and in half-profile, and that was the way he was photographing them for an outdoor exhibition that would open in Paris and then travel around the world. Other subjects were Francis Crick, the novelist García Márquez, the architect I. M. Pei.</p>
<p class="indent">Nor was it just another interview by a television personality that pumped life to a new level of frenetic high energy in the common room and pushed physics discussions into the corners. Steven Spielberg agreed to produce a film version of <em class="calibre1">A Brief History of Time</em>, to be directed by the young Errol Morris.</p>
<p class="indent">Morris was an inspired choice, with an unusual, intellectual, eclectic background. As a precocious ten-year-old he had given lectures on the solar system; as a teenager, played the cello and studied music with Nadia Boulanger at Fontainebleau; as an undergraduate, set records climbing in Yosemite; as a graduate student, rather unhappily done graduate work in science history at Princeton (studying with John Wheeler) and philosophy at Berkeley. None of this had appealed to Morris as his life’s work, but, along the way, he picked up experience that would help him better understand others who did not fit an ordinary mould, such as Stephen Hawking.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch13ref10" id="rch13ref10">10</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Although the Berkeley faculty had rejected Morris’s eccentric thesis proposal on the subject of the insanity plea, monster movies and murderers in Wisconsin prisons, his interest in the subject of ‘true crime’ continued after he began to make documentary films. Morris made contact with a man named Randal Adams, who was on death row awaiting execution for the murder of a Dallas policeman. Morris found the verdict questionable and took it upon <span id="page279">himself</span> to look into the case personally. He was not unqualified, having worked for several years as a private detective in New York when his film-making career was at a low ebb.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch13ref11" id="rch13ref11">11</a></sup> He documented his investigation of the Adams case on film, and solved it, winning Adams’s release. <em class="calibre1">The Thin Blue Line</em> premiered in 1988 to enormous critical acclaim and elevated Morris to the level of a major documentary film-maker. With good cause, he dubbed himself a ‘director/detective’.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch13ref12" id="rch13ref12">12</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">It was this interesting, complicated, brilliant young man whom Spielberg brought together with Stephen Hawking for the filming of <em class="calibre1">A Brief History of Time</em>. One of the challenges Morris liked to set himself as a director was ‘how to extract a situation’s truth without violating its mystery’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch13ref13" id="rch13ref13">13</a></sup> and it was with that question in mind that he approached the Hawking project.</p>
<p class="indent">Spielberg’s choice of Morris was partly made in the interest of solving a problem that emerged early on in the development of the film and threatened to doom the project. Hawking envisioned a film that would use all the state-of-the-art science fiction film-making technology and special effects available to Steven Spielberg and his colleagues to bring <em class="calibre1">A Brief History of Time</em> spectacularly to the screen. It seemed the project could not have fallen into better hands. He had no intention of allowing his personal life to be featured. The film-makers, however, argued that the film Hawking had in mind would never draw in the mass audience that both they and Hawking hoped to attract. The film must be biographical. Hawking took the matter up personally with Spielberg. One indomitable will had met another, but finally it was Spielberg who prevailed, by bringing Morris into the <span id="page280">project</span> and convincing Hawking that Morris could, as Hawking later wrote, ‘make a film that people would want to watch, but which doesn’t lose sight of the purpose of the book’.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch13ref14" id="rch13ref14">14</a></sup> Morris saw Hawking’s courageous life with severe physical limitations and his bold scientific quest as ‘inseparable themes’.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch13ref15" id="rch13ref15">15</a></sup> He chose to let Hawking narrate the film himself, in his own synthesized voice, and repeatedly filmed him reflected in his computer screen.</p>
<p class="indent">Among the most successful hallmarks of Morris’s previous work had been his genius as an interviewer and his skilful use of talking heads, and Hawking, in an extraordinary capitulation, gave Morris permission to interview his family, friends and scientific colleagues on film. His permission, however, could not ensure Jane Hawking’s permission. She and their three children are not in the film except in photographs. Elaine Mason also refused to be interviewed, but Gordon Freedman, the executive producer, found she was ‘a wonderful bouncing nurse’ who did ‘cartwheels on the soundstage’.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch13ref16" id="rch13ref16">16</a></sup> Stephen himself would not answer questions or make statements about his personal life in the film. However, Isobel Hawking, Stephen’s mother, agreed to appear, and Hawking, at the premiere, thanked Morris for making his mother a film star.</p>
<p class="indent">In an Afterword to the book published as a ‘companion’ to the film, <em class="calibre1">A Brief History of Time: A Reader’s Companion</em>, Gordon Freedman described the ‘very strong working relationship’ that developed between Hawking and Morris during the three years’ filming first in a London studio and then in Cambridge, when Morris, disappointed at the way the film was turning out, started all over again. ‘In the thick of the editing, Stephen <span id="page281">Hawking</span> and Errol Morris could be seen in the edit room for hours on end working toward a single vision for the film.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch13ref17" id="rch13ref17">17</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent"><em class="calibre1">A Brief History of Time</em> premiered in New York and Los Angeles in August 1992. It won the 1992 Grand Jury Prize for Documentary Filmmaking and the Documentary Filmmaker’s Trophy at the Sundance Festival, and the Filmmaker’s Award from the National Society of Film Critics. Philip Gourevitch, writing in <em class="calibre1">The New York Times Magazine</em>, commented perceptively: ‘Morris’s record of Hawking and the people who surround him creates the unexpected impression that he is a normal man who just happens to have the mind of a genius trapped in a devastated body.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch13ref18" id="rch13ref18">18</a></sup> David Ansen in <em class="calibre1">Newsweek</em> praised the film as ‘an elegant, inspirational and mysterious movie. Morris turns abstract ideas into haunting images, and keeps them spinning in the air with the finesse, and playfulness, of a master juggler.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch13ref19" id="rch13ref19">19</a></sup> Richard Schickel in <em class="calibre1">Time</em> magazine spoke of its ‘splendid talking heads’ and went on to say, ‘that the metaphorical richness of this hypnotic movie has been accomplished by such simple means is a mark of its excellence’.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch13ref20" id="rch13ref20">20</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Morris himself was more than pleased with the final result. He called Hawking ‘a symbol to millions of triumph over adversity and man’s insignificance in the face of an implacable cosmos out there’ and was satisfied that the film successfully conveyed that image. Compared with all previous work he had done, it was, Morris said, ‘less cerebral and more moving’, in spite of what might have seemed a difficult, esoteric subject, and even though in this film ‘everyone is smarter than me’.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch13ref21" id="rch13ref21">21</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">In spite of the undeniable beauty of the film and its <span id="page282">critical</span> success, it never reached a mass audience. In fact, it was never marketed or released to theatres in a way that would have allowed it to do that. We shall never know what the result would have been if Hawking had won the argument rather than Spielberg.</p>
<p class="indent">The world might have turned upside down when it came to Hawking’s personal life: Elaine had become hugely important to him; he had become a film star; but, with all that, when I visited him again a couple of years later in the office and common room in Silver Street, it was as though time there had stood still. The description I’d written in 1990 could have been written that day … the small clicking sounds, the words flitting back and forth, up and down, on the computer screen. The synthetic voice enunciated them politely. Students, nurses and colleagues passed in and out. At 4 p.m. the cups were lined up as precisely as a toy army on the counter in the common room. Former Lucasian Professors of Mathematics gazed down from their portraits on the intent little ‘rock group on a bad day’ as they sipped tea and talked their strange mathematical language. The figure in their midst was pitiful by all normal standards, like a guy on its way to the bonfire on Guy Fawkes Night. He wore a bib, and a nurse held his forehead and tipped his head forward so that he could drink his tea out of the cup she held under his chin. His hair was tousled, his mouth was slack, and his eyes were weary over the glasses that had slipped down his nose a little.
