<p class="chaptitle">‘It’s turtles all the way down’</p>
<p class="noindent"><span><span class="small">LUCY WAS ELEVEN</span></span> years old and completing her final year at Newnham Croft Primary School in the spring of 1982. She and her parents had decided that the best choice for the next stage of her education was the Perse School for Girls in Cambridge. Her brother Robert had been attending the Perse School for Boys since he was seven. In the 1960s a practical need for a job, so that he could get married, had sent Hawking off searching for singularities. This time, another practical need – for funds to pay Lucy’s school fees – launched him into a new enterprise that was to have a far-reaching impact on the Hawkings and others all over the world. It all began with Hawking’s decision to try to earn the money by writing a book about the universe – not an academic book but a book directed to people without a scientific education.</p>
<p class="indent">There had, of course, been other popular books about <span id="page225">the</span> universe and black holes. However, Hawking thought none of them spoke enough about the most interesting questions, the questions that had made him want to study cosmology and quantum theory: Where did the universe come from? How and why did it begin? Will it come to an end and, if so, how? Is there a complete theory of the universe and everything in it? Are we close to finding that theory? Is there a need for a Creator?</p>
<p class="indent">These were questions that he thought should interest everybody, not only scientists. However, science had become so technical and specialized that the general public was left out of the discussion. The trick in writing the book would be to make it understandable to non-scientists, and that meant using virtually no mathematics. He set to work dictating and completed the first draft in 1984.</p>
<p class="indent">Because it was a great deal of trouble dictating a book of this length, Hawking wanted the book to reach as many people as possible. His earlier books had been published by Cambridge University Press, one of the most prestigious academic publishers in the world, but after discussing his proposed new book with them and hearing them predict that it might sell 20,000 copies a year worldwide, Hawking decided he might do better with a publisher more attuned to the mass popular market. He wanted to see his book in airport bookstalls. His American agent discouraged this hope. Academics and students would buy the book, but the popular market, not likely. Hawking thought otherwise.</p>
<p class="indent">Several British publishers turned down the proposal, a decision they would regret.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch11ref1" id="rch11ref1">1</a></sup> But there were some offers. One of the most surprising came from Bantam. Against the advice of his agent, Hawking chose them. Bantam <span id="page226">might</span> not have specialized in publishing science books, but they sold many, many books in airports. Bantam in the United States paid $250,000 for the American rights, and Bantam–Transworld in the UK offered <em class="calibre1">£</em>30,000 for the British. Paying that much for a science book was a gamble – one of the best gambles either publisher ever made.</p>
<p class="h">A Year on the Brink</p>
<p class="noindent">1985 was a difficult year for the Hawking family. That summer, the plan was for Hawking to spend a month in Geneva at CERN. He was looking forward, among other things, to exploring the implications of some recent calculations by Don Page and Raymond LaFlamme having to do with arrows of time. Hawking, his nurses, his secretary Laura Gentry, and some of his students left Cambridge and travelled directly to Switzerland while Jane, Jonathan, Lucy and Tim took a more circuitous and adventurous route, camping across Belgium and Germany. They were to meet Stephen at the Bayreuth Festival and scrub up from campsite to formal standard to attend Wagner’s <em class="calibre1">Ring</em> cycle. At the time everyone was more concerned about Robert, who was trekking across Iceland and canoeing its northern coastline on a Venture Scout expedition, than they were about Stephen in safe, healthy Switzerland.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch11ref2" id="rch11ref2">2</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">On the eve of their arrival in Bayreuth, Jane found a public phone in Mannheim and rang her husband in Switzerland to arrange the schedule for the next day. A very distraught Laura Gentry answered the phone and urged her to come to Geneva at once. Stephen was in hospital with pneumonia. The situation looked grave. Jane arrived there to find Laura’s distress well warranted. <span id="page227">He</span> was on a life-support system, in an induced coma, barely hanging on to life.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing Hawking’s physical future with ALS, but not aware of his fierce determination to live, doctors gave Jane the choice whether to have him disconnected from life support and allowed to die. This was a heartbreaking situation. The only way to save his life would be to perform a tracheotomy. Afterwards, there would be no more problems with coughing and choking, but he would never again be able to speak or make any vocal sound. That seemed a ghastly price to pay. Hawking’s speech was slow and difficult to understand, but it was still speech, and his only possible means of communication. Without it, he couldn’t continue his career or even converse. What would survival be worth to him? Nevertheless, Jane remembers that her decision was ‘clear and unequivocal, pronounced without a second thought, that Stephen must live, despite the prognosis of likely complications ahead’ given her by the doctors, for as his wife she saw herself ‘as the agent of life, not death’.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch11ref3" id="rch11ref3">3</a></sup> ‘The future looked very, very bleak,’ she recalls. ‘We didn’t know how we were going to be able to survive – or if he was going to survive. It was my decision … but I have sometimes thought – what have I done? What sort of life have I let him in for?’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch11ref4" id="rch11ref4">4</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">When Hawking was strong enough, the University of Cambridge paid for an air ambulance to fly him back to Cambridge, where he was admitted to intensive care in Addenbrooke’s Hospital. Doctors made a final attempt to avoid the operation, but efforts to wean him off the respirator brought back the choking fits. A tracheotomy was the only way to proceed. Hawking remembers the vivid dreams he had during this time of flying in a hot-air <span id="page228">balloon</span>. He decided to take this as a symbol of hope.</p>
<p class="indent">Recovering slowly in the hospital, Hawking no longer breathed through his mouth and nose but through a small permanent opening made in his throat at about the height of his shirt collar. The only way he could communicate was to spell out words letter by letter by raising his eyebrows when someone pointed to the right letter on a spelling card.</p>
<p class="indent">After several weeks in intensive care, Hawking was allowed to come home on Sunday afternoons. Jane was determined that he would stay with her and their children and Jonathan rather than live in a nursing home. Since 1980, the community and private nurses arranged by Martin Rees had been coming for an hour or two each morning and evening to supplement the care given by Jane, the graduate assistant and Jonathan. However, from now on for as long as he lived, Hawking would need round-the-clock nurses. The cost was astronomical, far beyond the Hawkings’ resources. The National Health Service, which in Britain is paid for out of public funds, would have paid for a nursing home but could only offer a few hours’ nursing care in the Hawkings’ home plus help with bathing. ‘There was absolutely no way we could finance nursing at home,’ Jane says.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch11ref5" id="rch11ref5">5</a></sup> Not only Hawking’s work as a physicist but any sort of meaningful life at all seemed at an end. It was an end they’d expected to come much sooner, but it was no less bitter for all that.</p>
<p class="indent">‘At times things have looked absolutely dire for us and then something has come out of those crises,’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch11ref6" id="rch11ref6">6</a></sup> Jane has commented, recovering some of the optimism with which she had begun their marriage. Kip Thorne in California received word of his friend’s plight and immediately got <span id="page229">in</span> touch with Jane and suggested that she try to get funding from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation. Another friend, particle physicist Murray Gell-Mann, was on their board. The MacArthur Foundation agreed to help on a trial basis at first, with a grant to cover nursing care. More than three months after Hawking had entered the hospital, he came home to West Road in early November.</p>
<p class="indent">An unexpected ray of hope on the bleak horizon came when a computer expert in California, Walt Woltosz, sent a computer program he’d written for his disabled mother-in-law. ‘Equalizer’ allowed the user to select words from the computer screen and also had a built-in speech synthesizer. One of Hawking’s students devised an implement something like a computer mouse, so that Hawking could operate the program by a tiny movement that was still possible for him: squeezing this switch held in his hand. Should that fail him, head or eye movement could activate the switch.</p>
<p class="indent">Still too weak and ill to resume his research, Hawking practised with his computer. The first message he produced, after managing to make the computer say ‘Hello’ in the synthesized voice that was destined to become familiar all over the world, was to ask his graduate assistant, Brian Whitt, to help him finish writing his popular-level book.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch11ref7" id="rch11ref7">7</a></sup> That would have to wait until he was more proficient with Equalizer, but before long he could produce ten words a minute, not very fast but good enough to convince him that he could continue his career. ‘It was a bit slow,’ he says, ‘but then I think slowly, so it suited me quite well.’ Later, his speed improved. He was for a time able to produce more than fifteen words a minute.</p>
<p class="indent" id="page230">Here’s how the process worked, and still does, with a few modifications. The vocabulary programmed into the computer contains around 2,500 words, about two hundred of them specialized scientific terms. A screen full of words appears. The top half of the screen and the bottom half are highlighted alternately, back and forth, until Hawking sees the half-screen that includes the word he’s looking for highlighted, and squeezes the switch in his hand to choose that half-screen. Then lines of words on that half-screen are highlighted one after the other. When the line with the word he wants is highlighted, Hawking squeezes the switch again. The words on that line are then highlighted one by one. When the word he wants is highlighted, he presses the switch again. Sometimes he misses and the words or lines have to start over. There are a few often-used phrases, such as ‘Please turn the page’, ‘Please switch on the desk computer’, an alphabet for spelling out words not included in the program, and, I am told, a special file of insulting remarks, though I haven’t seen him use that.</p>
<p class="indent">Hawking selects the words one by one to make a sentence, which appears across the lower part of the screen. He can send the result to a speech synthesizer, which pronounces it out loud or over the telephone. (One strange fault with the process is that it cannot pronounce the word photon correctly, but always comes out with foe-t’n.) He can also save something on a disk and later print it out or rework it. He has a formatting program for writing papers, and he writes out his equations in words, which the program translates into symbols.</p>
<p class="indent">Hawking writes his lectures this way and saves them on disks. He can listen ahead of time to the speech synthesizer deliver a lecture, then edit and polish it. Before an <span id="page231">audience</span> he sends his lecture to the speech synthesizer a sentence at a time. An assistant shows slides, writes Hawking’s equations on the board, and answers some of the questions.</p>
<p class="indent">Hawking’s synthesized computer voice varies the intonation and doesn’t sound like a monotonal robot, which to him is an extremely important feature. At first he wished it gave him a British accent, but after a while he became so identified with it that ‘I would not want to change even if I were offered a British sounding voice. I would feel I had become a different person.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch11ref8" id="rch11ref8">8</a></sup> Just what accent it does give him is uncertain. Some people say it’s American or Scandinavian. To me it sounds East Indian, perhaps because of its slightly musical inflection. Hawking can’t inject emotion into the voice. The effect is measured, thoughtful, detached. Hawking’s son Tim thinks his father’s voice suits him. Tim of all the children is least able to remember what Hawking’s own voice sounded like. When he was born in 1979, there was little of that left.</p>
<p class="indent">Does all of this make conversation with Hawking seem like talking to a machine – like something alien, from science fiction? At first just a little. Soon you forget all about it. Hawking is comfortable with the odd situation and patient when others are not. When he was reading parts of this book while I held the pages, it was his nurse, not he, who suggested that it was unnecessary for me to wait for Hawking to select ‘Please turn the page’, which involved a number of manoeuvres on the computer screen. As soon as he started clicking, she said, I could turn the page and save him trouble and time. He’d put up with my way of doing things for an hour and a half without <span id="page232">indicating</span> that I was in any way inconveniencing him. As it happened, the next time Hawking ‘clicked’ and I turned the page, he was making a comment, not asking for a page turn.</p>
<p class="indent">Hawking’s sense of humour is contagious and likely to break out at any moment. However, when one interviewer commented to Hawking that it must be frustrating, telling jokes and having your listeners anticipate the punchline before you have a chance to crack it, Hawking admitted that ‘I often find that by the time I have written something, the conversation has moved on to another subject.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch11ref9" id="rch11ref9">9</a></sup> Nevertheless, when his face lights up with a smile, it is difficult to believe this man has many problems. The Hawking grin is famous, and it reveals the quality of his love for his subject. It’s a grin that says, ‘This is all very impressive and serious, but – ain’t it fun!’</p>
<p class="indent">It is, of course, nothing short of miraculous that Hawking has been able to achieve everything he has, even that he’s still alive. However, when you meet him and experience his intelligence and humour, you begin to take his unusual mode of communication and his obviously catastrophic physical problems no more seriously than he seems to himself. That is the way he wants it. He chooses to ignore the difficulty, ‘not think about my condition, or regret the things it prevents me from doing, which are not that many.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch11ref10" id="rch11ref10">10</a></sup> He expects others to adopt the same attitude.</p>
<p class="h">1985–1986</p>
<p class="noindent">In the autumn of 1985, with the Equalizer raising Hawking’s hopes of getting on with his career and his popular-level book, Jane and Laura Gentry interviewed and hired the twenty-four-hour nursing staff who were <span id="page233">going</span> to make life at home possible. There would be three shifts a day, and the nurses had to be trained medical professionals. The tube that had been inserted in his throat had to be suctioned out regularly with a ‘mini-vacuum cleaner’ so that secretions would not accumulate in his lungs. The ‘mini-vacuum cleaner’ itself could be a source of infection and cause damage if not used correctly.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch11ref11" id="rch11ref11">11</a></sup> Not everyone they interviewed wanted this kind of demanding work, and there were also a few false starts.</p>
<p class="indent">One applicant who was eager to have the job and willing to dedicate herself to it long term was Elaine Mason, a physically strong, athletic woman with a zany sense of humour and a wonderful taste for colours that showed off her red hair. She impressed Jane as a caring person. Born Elaine Sybil Lawson in Hereford, Elaine was a devout Evangelical Christian whose father, Henry Lawson, had been a clergyman in the Church of England and whose mother had a medical degree. Elaine had worked for four years in an orphanage in Bangladesh, then come back to England and married David Mason, a computer engineer. They had two sons, one about the age of Tim Hawking.</p>
<p class="indent">I knew Elaine and David Mason and their sons only as a family with children in the same school as ours, but I remember that on parents’ day I competed successfully with Elaine in the egg-and-spoon race. She was reputed to be fiercely competitive, but that wasn’t evident in this particular sport. She seemed a refreshingly irrepressible, uninhibited woman.</p>
<p class="indent">Stephen’s and Jane’s hiring of Elaine became a fortuitous choice when her husband adapted a small computer and speech synthesizer and attached it to Hawking’s wheelchair. Before that Hawking could run <span id="page234">the</span> Equalizer only on his desktop computer. Now his voice could go with him wherever he went. David Mason, like his wife, was devoted to Hawking. ‘If he raised an eyebrow, you would run a mile,’ he said.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch11ref12" id="rch11ref12">12</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">The Hawking household adapted to the new tensions of living a much less private life, in what seemed like a small-scale hospital with strangers abroad in it twenty-four hours a day. Hawking managed to recover enough strength and to handle the Equalizer program well enough to return to his office before Christmas. There were no more solo trips across the Backs; a nurse went with him. In many ways, things were looking up. His son Robert received his A-level exam results and, to everyone’s relief, they were excellent. Cambridge would accept Robert for the following autumn, to read natural science as his father had at Oxford.</p>
<p class="indent">By the spring of 1986, life had begun to settle into a new, rather optimistic status quo, with one sad break in March when Frank Hawking, Stephen’s father, died. Hawking’s mother Isobel has said that Hawking was ‘very upset by his father’s death – it was rather a dreadful thing. He was very fond of his father, but they had grown apart rather and hadn’t seen a great deal of each other in the late years.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch11ref13" id="rch11ref13">13</a></sup> Hawking, of course, soldiered on. Soon he resumed his travels. His first trip away, to a conference in Sweden, was a success in more ways than one. Murray Gell-Mann was another attendee and witnessed first hand Hawking’s ability to take a full part in the conference – evidence of how well the MacArthur funds were being put to work. Jane’s application in October for an extension of the funding was approved. Now it would cover medical expenses as well as nurses on a continuing basis.</p>
<p class="h" id="page235">The Assault on the Airport Bookshops</p>
<p class="noindent">Having mastered the Equalizer program, Hawking went back to work on his popular-level book in the spring of 1986. It hadn’t taken him long, characteristically, to begin to regard the new level of disability as an advantage rather than a calamity. ‘In fact,’ said Hawking, ‘I can communicate better now than before I lost my voice.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch11ref14" id="rch11ref14">14</a></sup> That statement is often quoted as an example of raw courage. It was, in fact, the simple truth. He no longer needed to dictate or speak through an ‘interpreter’.</p>
<p class="indent">Bantam had accepted Hawking’s first draft for the book in the summer of 1985, but, with his catastrophic health problems, there had been no opportunity to move forward with the project. In any case, moving forward was not going to be an easy task. Bantam was insisting on some revisions. Hawking ended up almost completely rewriting his first draft.</p>
<p class="indent">He knew that even in non-technical language the concepts in his book would not be easy for most people. He claims he is not overly fond of equations himself, in spite of the fact that people compare his ability to handle them in his head to Mozart’s mentally composing a whole symphony. It is difficult for him to write equations, even though the Equalizer allows him to express them in words and then rewrites them with symbols. He says he has no intuitive feeling for them. As Kip Thorne pointed out, he likes to think instead in pictures. This, in fact, seemed an excellent method for the book: to describe his mental images in words, helped along with familiar analogies and a few diagrams.</p>
<p class="indent">Hawking’s and his graduate assistant Whitt’s mode of operation fell into a pattern. Hawking would explain <span id="page236">something</span> in scientific language and then realize that his readers would not understand. He and Whitt would try to think of an analogy, but neither was willing to use analogies willy-nilly without being certain they were truly valid. Making sure of their validity occasioned lengthy discussions. Hawking wondered just how much to explain. Were some complicated matters better glossed over and left at that? Would explaining too much lead to confusion? Ultimately Hawking explained a great deal.</p>
<p class="indent">His editor at Bantam, Peter Guzzardi, wasn’t a scientist. He felt that whatever he couldn’t understand in the manuscript needed rewriting. He pointed out something that Hawking’s students and colleagues had sometimes complained about: Hawking often jumped from thought to thought and came to surprising conclusions, wrongly assuming others could see the connections. Some attributed this to Hawking’s need to use few words, but the reason went deeper than that, and his scientific colleagues were experiencing something of the same jumps on a far more advanced level than Peter Guzzardi. Whitt said that sometimes Hawking would tell him that something must be so ‘because of what I understand’, not because he could prove it or explain how he arrived there. Brian would do the calculations and sometimes have to report to Hawking that he had been wrong, and Hawking would not believe him. Then after some consideration and talking about it, Brian would realize that Hawking was right after all. ‘His hunch was better than my calculation. I think that’s a very important aspect of his mind: the ability to think ahead rather than go step by step; to jump the simple calculations and just come up with a conclusion.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch11ref15" id="rch11ref15">15</a></sup> Nevertheless, for Hawking’s editor Guzzardi, <span id="page237">jumping</span> the connections between his conclusions wasn’t acceptable for a popular-level book. Even when Hawking felt he’d explained simply, Guzzardi often found the explanation unfathomable. At one point, Bantam tactfully suggested having an experienced science writer write the book for Hawking. Hawking vehemently rejected that idea. The revision process became tedious. Each time Hawking submitted a rewritten chapter, Guzzardi sent back a lengthy list of objections and questions. Hawking was irritated, but in the end he admitted that his editor was right. ‘It is a much better book as a result,’ he said.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch11ref16" id="rch11ref16">16</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Editors at Cambridge University Press who had seen Hawking’s book proposal had warned him that every equation he used would cut book sales in half. Guzzardi agreed. Hawking eventually decided he would include only one equation: Einstein’s <em class="calibre1">E=mc<sup class="calibre3">2</sup></em>. Guzzardi prevailed in a disagreement about the title. When Hawking got nervous about the use of the word ‘brief’, Guzzardi replied that he liked it very much, it made him smile. That argument won the day. The title would be <em class="calibre1">A Brief History of Time</em>. The second draft was finally completed a year after they had begun working on it, in the spring of 1987.</p>
<p class="indent">By then, Hawking was also fully involved in the physics world again, continuing his career and gathering more honours and awards. In October 1986 he had received an appointment to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, and the whole Hawking family had an audience with the Pope. He was awarded the first Paul Dirac Medal from the Institute of Physics. In June and July 1987, after the final draft of <em class="calibre1">A Brief History of Time</em> was completed, Cambridge hosted an international conference to celebrate the 300th anniversary of the publication of Isaac Newton’s <span id="page238"><em class="calibre1">Principia</em></span> <em class="calibre1">Mathematica</em>, one of the most significant books in the history of science. Hawking was instrumental in bringing this event about. In connection with it, he and Werner Israel solicited articles from leaders in the fields connected with gravitation and put together the splendid book <em class="calibre1">300 Years of Gravitation</em>.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch11ref17" id="rch11ref17">17</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">When <em class="calibre1">A Brief History of Time</em> was nearing publication, in the early spring of 1988, Don Page was sent an advance copy to review for the journal <em class="calibre1">Nature</em>. Page was appalled to find it full of errors: photographs and diagrams in the wrong places and wrongly labelled. He placed an urgent call to Bantam. Bantam editors decided to recall and scrap the entire printing. Then began the intense process of correcting and republishing the book in time to have it in bookshops by the April publication date in the United States. Page now believes he owns one of the few extant copies of the original printing of Hawking’s book. That copy is probably quite valuable.</p>
<p class="indent">Hawking enjoys pointing out that the American edition of <em class="calibre1">A Brief History of Time: From the Big Bang to Black Holes</em> was published on April Fool’s Day, 1988. The British edition was launched at a luncheon at the Royal Society on 16 June. The Hawkings watched, astounded, as the book climbed effortlessly to the top of the bestseller lists. There it stayed week after unlikely week, then month after month, soon selling a million copies in America. In Britain the publisher could barely keep enough books on the shelves to meet the demand. Translations into other languages quickly followed. The book was indeed prominently displayed in airport bookstalls, and Hawking had to face the difficulty of getting his speech synthesizer to pronounce the word ‘Guinness’ when he and his book made <span id="page239">the</span> <em class="calibre1">Guinness Book of World Records</em>. It insisted on saying ‘Guy-ness’. ‘Maybe it is because it is an American speech synthesizer,’ Hawking quipped. ‘If only I had an Irish one …’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch11ref18" id="rch11ref18">18</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Perhaps thanks to his persistent editor, Hawking had succeeded in making it possible (though not always easy) to follow him logically from thought to thought, sometimes even to anticipate him. This was a book to be studied, if you didn’t have a scientific background, not read quickly. It was well worth the effort, and it was also good entertainment. Hawking’s humour makes <em class="calibre1">A Brief History of Time</em> in its way a romp through the history of time, not safe to read in any situation where it would be awkward to burst out laughing.</p>
<p class="indent">Stephen Hawking rapidly became a household word and a popular hero all over the world. Fans organized a club in Chicago and printed Hawking T-shirts. One member admitted that some of his school friends thought this Hawking on his T-shirt must be a rock star; a few even claimed to have his latest album.</p>
<p class="indent">Reviews were favourable. One compared the book to <em class="calibre1">Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</em>. Jane Hawking was horrified, but Stephen Hawking declared he was flattered, that this meant his book ‘gives people the feeling that they need not be cut off from the great intellectual and philosophical questions’.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch11ref19" id="rch11ref19">19</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Did people who bought the book read it and understand it? Some critics suggested that most of those who purchased it never read it and, if they tried, couldn’t possibly understand it. They just wanted it to be seen on their coffee table. Hawking lashed back rather forcefully in the foreword to <em class="calibre1">A Brief History of Time: A Reader’s <span id="page240">Companion</span></em>: ‘I think some critics are rather patronizing to the general public. They feel that they, the critics, are very clever people, and if they can’t understand my book completely then ordinary mortals have no chance.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch11ref20" id="rch11ref20">20</a></sup> He wasn’t overly concerned about its being left on coffee tables and bookcases just for show. The Bible and Shakespeare, he pointed out, have shared that fate for centuries. Nevertheless, he thought lots of people read his book, because he got mounds of letters about it. Many asked questions and made detailed comments. He was often stopped by strangers in the street who said how much they enjoyed it; this pleased him immensely but embarrassed his son Timmy.</p>
<p class="indent">Hawking’s increasing celebrity status and the need to publicize the book gave him even more opportunities for travel than before. A Hawking visit usually left his hosts exhausted. The Rockefeller Institute in New York was the scene of one such occasion. After a long day of lectures and public appearances, there was a banquet in Hawking’s honour. Hawking relished such events and made a show of sniffing the wine and commenting on it. Dinner and speeches over, the party moved to the embankment overlooking the East River. Everyone was petrified lest Hawking roll into the river. To their relief he didn’t, and they soon had him safely headed back towards his hotel. In a ballroom opening off the lobby, a dance was going on. Hawking insisted that they not retire yet but crash the party. Unable to dissuade their headstrong honoree, the little group of distinguished scholars hesitatingly agreed, ‘although we never do anything like that!’ On the dance floor Hawking twirled about in his wheelchair with one partner after another. The band went on <span id="page241">playing</span> for him far into the night, long after the original party was over.</p>
<p class="indent">Would Hawking write a sequel to his book? Asked that frequently, he answered that he thought not. ‘What would I call it? <em class="calibre1">A Longer History of Time</em>? <em class="calibre1">Beyond the End of Time</em>? <em class="calibre1">Son of Time</em>?’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch11ref21" id="rch11ref21">21</a></sup> Perhaps <em class="calibre1">A Brief History of Time II</em> – ‘just when you thought it was safe to go back into the airport bookstore!’ Would he write his autobiography? Not until he runs out of money to pay his nurses, or so he told me. That was not likely to be soon. <em class="calibre1">Time</em> magazine announced in August 1990 that <em class="calibre1">A Brief History of Time</em> had so far sold over 8 million copies, and they were still selling. If only he had left out that one equation!</p>
<p class="indent">Some accused Bantam and Hawking of exploiting Hawking’s condition in marketing the book. They sniffed that his fame and popularity were like a carnival sideshow and blamed Hawking for allowing an overdramatic, grotesque picture to appear on the book cover. Hawking rejoined that his contract gave him absolutely no control over the cover. He did persuade the publisher to use a better picture on the British edition.</p>
<p class="indent">On the plus side, the media exposure allowed Hawking to give the world something that may be at least as valuable as his scientific theories and the information that the universe is probably not ‘turtles all the way down’.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#FT1pg241" id="rFT1pg241">fn1</a></sup> It <span id="page242">brought</span> to millions not only his keen excitement about his work but also the important reminder that there is a profound kind of health which transcends the boundaries of any illness.</p>
<p class="indent">For the Hawkings the success of the book brought more than a change in financial status, making Hawking into what <em class="calibre1">CAM</em> magazine called ‘that rarest of phenomena, a Labour-voting multi-millionaire’.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch11ref22" id="rch11ref22">22</a></sup> For years, he and Jane and their children had lived with disability and the threat of death. As Jane Hawking described it: ‘In a sense we’ve always been living on the edge of the precipice, and eventually you put down roots at the edge of the precipice. I think that’s what we’ve done.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch11ref23" id="rch11ref23">23</a></sup> Now they found themselves threatened in a different way, by the allure and demands of celebrity and the frightening prospect of living up to a worldwide fairy-tale image.</p>
<p class="indent">In the mid- to late 1980s, it was often Elaine Mason who accompanied Hawking in his travels, and their growing fondness for one another was evident in a series of photographs taken by a friend of Elaine’s, New York photographer Miriam Berkeley. Unfortunately, Elaine’s fierce loyalty to Hawking, her protectiveness, her jealously guarded relationship with him and the strength of her personality were beginning not to sit so well with his family, others of his nurses and carers, or with colleagues and staff in the DAMTP. But her relationship with Hawking was a special relationship that was not going to evaporate any time soon. Others were competent and sympathetic, but it was Elaine he preferred to have with him as much as possible.</p>
<p class="footnote-ts"><a href="#rFT1pg241" id="FT1pg241">fn1</a> In his book <em class="calibre1">A Brief History of Time</em> Hawking retold the story of an elderly lady who rose at the end of a scientific lecture to take exception with the speaker and insist that the world is a plate supported on the back of a giant turtle. When the speaker asked what she thought the turtle was standing on, she replied that he was very clever to ask that question, but in fact it was ‘turtles all the way down’.</p>
