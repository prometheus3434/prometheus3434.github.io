<p class="h3c">About the Book</p>
<p class="noindent-bs">Stephen Hawking is one of the most remarkable figures of our time – a Cambridge genius who has earned international celebrity and become an inspiration to those who have witnessed his triumph over disability. This is Hawking’s life story by Kitty Ferguson, written with help from Hawking himself and his close associates.</p>
<p class="noindent-bs">Ferguson’s <em class="calibre1">Stephen Hawking’s Quest for a Theory of Everything</em> was a <em class="calibre1">Sunday Times</em> bestseller in 1992. She has now transformed that short book into a hugely expanded, carefully researched, up-to-the-minute biography giving a rich picture of Hawking’s life – his childhood, the heart-rending beginning of his struggle with motor neurone disease, his ever-increasing international fame, and his long personal battle for survival in pursuit of a scientific understanding of the universe. Throughout, Kitty Ferguson also summarizes and explains the cutting-edge science in which Hawking has been engaged.</p>
<p class="noindent"><em class="calibre1">Stephen Hawking</em> is written with the clarity and simplicity for which all Kitty Ferguson’s books have been praised. The result is a captivating account of an extraordinary life and mind.</p>
