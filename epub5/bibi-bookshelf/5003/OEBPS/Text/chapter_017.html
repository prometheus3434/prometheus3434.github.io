<p class="chaptitle">‘An expanding horizon of possibilities’</p>
<p class="noindent"><span><span class="small">IN A STATEMENT</span></span> in january 2000, part of an interview for the millennium focusing on his predictions about what the future held in store for the human race, Hawking summed up his thoughts on the issue of genetic engineering. Humans, he said, have had no significant changes in their DNA over ten thousand years. But soon they will no longer have to wait for biological evolution to make changes for them – and they won’t wait. In the next thousand years we will probably be able to redesign our DNA completely, increasing our brain size. Whatever bans are placed on genetic engineering in humans, it will surely be allowed on animals and plants for economic reasons, ‘and someone is bound to try it on humans unless we have a totalitarian world order. Someone will improve humans somewhere. I am not advocating human genetic engineering. I am just saying it is likely to happen and we should consider how to deal with it.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch17ref1" id="rch17ref1">1</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent" id="page344">A year and a half later, he had changed his mind. In an interview given shortly before September 11, he told the German periodical <em class="calibre1">Focus</em> that humans would be well advised to modify their DNA in order to avoid being outdistanced by super-intelligent computers that would eventually rule the world.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch17ref2" id="rch17ref2">2</a></sup> Are computers really likely to become that intelligent? Hawking had previously commented that computers are ‘less complex than the brain of an earthworm, a species not known for its intellectual powers’.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch17ref3" id="rch17ref3">3</a></sup> But he thought that ‘if very complicated chemical molecules can operate in humans to make them intelligent, then equally complicated electronic circuits can also make computers act in an intelligent way’.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch17ref4" id="rch17ref4">4</a></sup> Intelligent computers will then design even more intelligent and complex computers.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch17ref5" id="rch17ref5">5</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">His new position was controversial, but it was largely forgotten in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. The interviews that inevitably followed – for the media felt confident that Stephen Hawking would have wise words to offer on other topics besides physics – gave him the opportunity to introduce another issue that he had been considering. He told an interviewer from the <em class="calibre1">Guardian</em>: ‘although September 11 was horrible, it did not threaten the survival of the entire human race. The danger is that either by accident or design we may create a virus that destroys us.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch17ref6" id="rch17ref6">6</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Hawking advised that plans be put in place as soon as possible with the long-range goal of colonizing space to ensure the survival of the human race. This was not an off-the-cuff notion, soon to be forgotten. Already in the millennial interview he had predicted a manned, ‘or should I say personned’, flight to Mars within the century. But that would be only the first stop. Mars isn’t suitable <span id="page345">for</span> human habitation. We need either to learn to live in space stations or travel to the next star, and that journey he was sure would not happen within the century. Because we can’t travel faster than light (no matter what science fiction claims), the trip would be slow, boring and arduous. Hawking would return to the advisability for humans to colonize space in the children’s books he would write with his daughter Lucy a few years later. This need seemed urgent enough for him to try to ingrain it in the minds of children who would be setting the agenda in the future.</p>
<p class="indent">Not everyone appreciated pronouncements like these about issues beyond his own field of expertise. Most of Hawking’s critics called him not ‘wrong’ but ‘naïve’. Sir Brian Pippard, an eminent twentieth-century physicist, once apologized for himself and his colleagues for being ‘inclined to believe that their expertise absolves them from the duty of studying other branches of knowledge before contributing their own penn’orth of wisdom’.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch17ref7" id="rch17ref7">7</a></sup> Hawking could perhaps be declared guilty, but he knew he had a golden opportunity to reach the public with ideas he strongly believes are important and ought to be heard. He possibly had enough clout to influence public policy.</p>
<p class="h">The TOE Revisited</p>
<p class="noindent">In his Lucasian inaugural lecture in 1980, Hawking had announced that the most promising candidate to unify the forces and particles was N=8 supergravity. In 1990 he had told me he suspected it might turn out to be superstrings, with his no-boundary proposal answering the question about the boundary conditions of the universe. Now, the close of the millennium had come and gone. Still no end <span id="page346">to</span> theoretical physics. Still no Theory of Everything. In April 2002, Hawking told a reporter that ‘I still think there’s a 50-50 chance that we will find a complete unified theory in the next twenty years’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch17ref8" id="rch17ref8">8</a></sup> – a much more modest and tentative forecast than he had made in his Lucasian Lecture.</p>
<p class="indent">As the months passed, Hawking hedged his bets even more. He was reconsidering one of the main thrusts of his scientific career, beginning to suspect that the fundamental, unified theory – if it exists at all – is at a level that will never be accessible to us. Our understanding will always resemble a patchwork quilt, with different theories holding in different regions, agreeing only in certain overlapping areas. If this is the case, then it would be ill advised to view what seem like inconsistencies among the theories as a sign that they are weak or incorrect. What we would be able to discover about the universe would inevitably be something like a jigsaw puzzle in which it is not so difficult ‘to identify and fit together the pieces around the edges’ – supergravity and the different string theories – but in which we will never be able to ‘have much idea what happens in the middle’.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch17ref9" id="rch17ref9">9</a></sup> In a lecture for the Paul Dirac Centennial Celebration at Cambridge, in July 2002, he said, ‘Some people will be very disappointed if there is not an ultimate theory that can be formulated as a finite number of principles. I used to belong to that camp, but I have changed my mind.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch17ref10" id="rch17ref10">10</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Hawking asked his audience to recall the Austrian mathematician Kurt Gödel, who in 1931 had shown that mathematics was ‘incomplete’ because in any mathematical system complex enough to include the addition and multiplication of whole numbers, there are <span id="page347">propositions</span> that can be stated – and that we can even <em class="calibre1">see</em> are true – but that cannot be proved or disproved mathematically within the system. Hawking thought that it might also be the case in physics that there are things that are true but cannot be proved. Kip Thorne had spoken about the change in Hawking’s way of working, from an insistence on rigorous mathematical proof to a quest not for certainty but for ‘high probability and rapid movement towards the ultimate goal of understanding the nature of the universe’.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch17ref11" id="rch17ref11">11</a></sup> Hawking had made large intuitive leaps, expecting others to fill in the gaps he was leaving behind. Was he now about to become even more daring, warning his listeners that things he was sure are true would be impossible to prove? No, even he had to join the human race at the brink of a chasm that no one could cross. Our theories are inconsistent or incomplete, he said, because ‘we and our models are both part of the universe we are describing … Physical theories are self-referential.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch17ref12" id="rch17ref12">12</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">The new and still elusive candidate he spoke about in his Dirac Centennial lecture was not ‘an ultimate theory that can be formulated as a finite number of principles’, but it might be the best we could ever do. It was M-theory. A particularly interesting version of that theory incorporated the brane theory that Townsend had suggested. Recall from our discussion of p-branes that when p = 1, that <em class="calibre1">is</em> a string. So strings could now be considered members of the larger clan that Townsend had named p-branes. Hawking was not throwing supergravity and string theory, his two earlier favourite candidates for the Theory of Everything, out of the window by any means. The five most promising superstring theories could be grouped in a family of theories that would also include <span id="page348">supergravity</span>. The superstring theories and supergravity were the pieces of the ‘patchwork quilt’, useful for considering different situations, but none of them applied in <em class="calibre1">all</em> situations. The unexpected network of relationships that physicists had found among them had led to the suspicion that these theories are all actually different expressions of a deeper, underlying theory – M-theory – which did not, as yet, <em class="calibre1">have</em> a single formulation. Hawking had begun to think it never would.</p>
<p class="indent">In the M-theory network of mathematical models, spacetime has a total of ten or eleven dimensions. These are usually taken to be nine or ten space dimensions and one time dimension. You may be wondering why no one ever thinks there might be more than one time dimension, so I should tell you that some versions of the theory do allow more time dimensions, as long as the total stays the same.</p>
<p class="indent">We, of course, experience only four dimensions. Where are the others? Hawking himself commented in 2001: ‘I must say that personally I have been reluctant to believe in extra dimensions. But as I am a positivist, the question “Do extra dimensions really exist?” has no meaning. All one can ask is whether mathematical models with extra dimensions provide a good description of the universe.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch17ref13" id="rch17ref13">13</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">The proposed answer to the question of why we don’t see them is that the extras are rolled up very small. Think of a garden hose. We know that a garden hose has thickness to it, but from a distance it looks like a line with length but no other dimension. If the extra dimensions were ‘rolled up’ like that we would miss noticing them, not only on human scales, but even on atomic or nuclear physics scales.</p>
<p class="indent" id="page349">Could we ever observe them? Suppose one or more of the extra dimensions is not so completely rolled up after all. That suggestion may be testable with a more advanced generation of particle accelerators or by measuring the gravitational force operating over extremely short distances.</p>
<p class="indent">Meanwhile, M-theory and extra dimensions had staked out a claim in the future of theoretical physics and cosmology. That future would be the theme of a conference held to celebrate Hawking’s sixtieth birthday in 2002.</p>
<p class="h">Sixty or Bust!</p>
<p class="noindent">Hawking’s sixtieth-birthday party almost didn’t happen. He and his wheelchair ran into a wall a few days before the event. Hawking brushed this off in the opening of his lecture, ‘Sixty Years in a Nutshell’: ‘It was nearly 59.97 years in a nutshell. I had an argument with a wall a few days after Christmas, and the wall won. But Addenbrooke’s Hospital did a very good job of putting me back together again.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch17ref14" id="rch17ref14">14</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">There had been a moment when those planning the birthday party stopped dead and held their breath, but then it was learned that Hawking was working on his own birthday speech in his hospital bed. The preparations continued. No one had to cancel, at the last minute, the Marilyn Monroe impersonator who would fawn over Hawking and croon ‘I Want to be Loved By You’ … or tell all the physics luminaries gathering from around the world that they could come and give their talks, but the man they were celebrating would not be present. The party happened. Hawking thought sixty was well worth <span id="page350">celebrating</span>. Many people, he told interviewers, don’t welcome turning sixty, but for him it was an accomplishment. He had never expected to live so long.</p>
<p class="indent">It was a many-faceted celebration. A serious four-day ‘fest schrift’ conference featured high-level papers presented by giants of theoretical physics and cosmology whose work touched on Hawking’s. The public was admitted for a day of popular-level lectures. The real partying took place in the evening, attended by a crowd of as many as 200 guests. There was ‘Marilyn’, whom Hawking dubbed ‘a model of the universe’. There was a choir of former and current graduate students and Hawking’s first wife Jane, conducted by her husband, Jonathan Hellyer Jones, and accompanied by the U2 guitarist, Edge. Because Hawking’s birthday fell close to the church Feast of St Stephen, they sang ‘Good King Wenceslas’ with new words written by Bernard Carr. ‘Page and Hawking, forth they went’ referred to Don Page. At one of the parties, in the Hall of Caius, Martin Rees – by this time Sir Martin Rees, Astronomer Royal – spoke glowingly about his old friend. A party in the Hall of Trinity College featured a sudden burst of colour and music as can-can dancers made a spectacular entrance. Television crews from Channel 4, the BBC, and America’s CBS were present, and there was a live webcast to the BBC’s website of Hawking’s public lecture and the audience’s rowdy, spontaneous, painfully off-key singing of ‘Happy Birthday’ that followed it – one of many renditions of it that week. The BBC later broadcast all the popular lectures as ‘The Hawking Lectures’.</p>
<p class="indent">Hawking’s colleagues took advantage of the opportunity to rib him:</p>
<p class="indent" id="page351">Martin Rees: ‘Astronomers are used to large numbers, but few are as huge as the odds I would have offered then [when Hawking was a graduate student at Cambridge] against witnessing this marvellous celebration.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch17ref15" id="rch17ref15">15</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Roger Penrose: ‘I am very glad to note that Stephen has now also officially become an old man, so that he can also get away with saying such outrageous things. Of course Stephen has always done that kind of thing, but he can perhaps feel a little bolder in this even than before.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch17ref16" id="rch17ref16">16</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Bernard Carr: ‘I’ve often suspected that there must be more than one Stephen Hawking to have made so many important discoveries. I would like to wish all of them a very happy sixtieth birthday!’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch17ref17" id="rch17ref17">17</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Leonard Susskind: ‘Stephen, as we all know, is by far the most stubborn and infuriating person in the universe.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch17ref18" id="rch17ref18">18</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Raphael Bousso: ‘It is a pleasure to help celebrate Stephen Hawking’s sixtieth birthday (not least because Stephen knows how to party).’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch17ref19" id="rch17ref19">19</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Gary Gibbons, praising ‘Stephen’s indomitable courage and daring optimism’,<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch17ref20" id="rch17ref20">20</a></sup> quoted Robert Browning: ‘Ah, but a man’s reach should exceed his grasp or what’s a heaven for?’</p>
<p class="indent">Michael Green recalled the early 1970s in Cambridge, when he first met Stephen, and cosmology was held in such low regard that ‘it was considered a sub-branch of astrology and was not discussed at all!’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch17ref21" id="rch17ref21">21</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Neil Turok spoke of Hawking’s ‘real “lust for life” that keeps him going against all odds’.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch17ref22" id="rch17ref22">22</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Kip Thorne’s birthday present was a promise that ‘gravitational wave detectors – LIGO, GEO, VIRGO and LISA – will test your Golden-Age black-hole predictions, <span id="page352">and</span> they will begin to do so well before your seventieth birthday’.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch17ref23" id="rch17ref23">23</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">The papers prepared for the sixtieth-birthday conference gave a splendid summing up of where things stood in theoretical physics and cosmology in 2002, and how they had got there, and, as the conference title suggested, provided a springboard for the future. It brought together the finest minds in the world on the topics that most interested Hawking and impinged on his own work, and also to a remarkable extent brought together the grey eminences of the field with energetic younger people who were going to carry it into the future, many of whom had been Hawking’s students. It all went on for a week … and why not? This was a birthday party no one for many of the sixty years had expected to attend. Elaine’s birthday gift was a thirty-minute flight in a specially designed hot-air balloon. When Hawking had dreamed of such a flight at the time of his tracheotomy in 1985, he had taken it as a symbol of hope. At the age of sixty, it seemed that this hope had been amply fulfilled.</p>
<p class="indent">Hawking’s colleagues and others who shared his birthday celebration were willing to accept his brushing off his wheelchair accident as something trivial, but it was in truth more serious than that. Wheeling along the uneven old pavement of Malting Lane near his home, accompanied by a nurse, he had lost control and crashed his chair into a wall, turning the chair over and breaking his hip. Neel Shearer, his graduate assistant, shrugged: ‘He was late for an appointment and running on Hawking time, as ever.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch17ref24" id="rch17ref24">24</a></sup> Hawking’s weakened condition precluded the use of a general anaesthetic when the doctors repaired him. With only an epidural anaesthetic, Hawking experienced <span id="page353">the</span> whole procedure, something ‘like hearing a Black and Decker drill’.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch17ref25" id="rch17ref25">25</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Hawking’s sixtieth-birthday year saw the publication of his carefully chosen compilation of excerpts from the writings of Copernicus, Galileo, Kepler, Newton and Einstein. <em class="calibre1">On the Shoulders of Giants</em> also featured biographical sketches of the five men and commentary by Hawking.</p>
<p class="h">Unpacking the CMBR</p>
<p class="noindent">As the new millennium got underway, a new generation of observers and observational instruments were gearing up to test the predictions made by inflation cosmology with unprecedented accuracy.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch17ref26" id="rch17ref26">26</a></sup> In a continued search for experimental evidence that might, or might not, support inflation predictions, attention focused, not surprisingly, on the CMBR, the afterglow of the Big Bang. George Smoot’s discovery had shown that in the extraordinarily evenly dispersed microwave light, the temperature does vary from point to point. In 1998 (results released in 2000), balloon observations had measured the CMBR in detail in certain parts of the sky;<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch17ref27" id="rch17ref27">27</a></sup> and in 2001 the ground-based Degree Angular Scale Interferometer at the South Pole took similar measurements.</p>
<p class="indent">Then, in June 2001, NASA launched WMAP, the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#FT1pg353" id="rFT1pg353">fn1</a></sup> Its mission: to map the CMBR more precisely than had ever before been possible. It was capable of measuring temperature differences varying by only a millionth of a degree and, because it was a satellite rather than a land-based instrument, take these measurements over the entire sky. The expectation was that WMAP would settle once and for all many of the arguments of the last few decades about the basic properties of the universe – its age, its shape, its expansion rate, its composition, its density. Different versions of inflation theory were telling slightly different stories about precisely how inflation happened and making predictions about what pattern of temperature variations we should find in the CMBR if we compare its temperature in different directions.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch17ref28" id="rch17ref28">28</a></sup> WMAP data were expected to give scientists ways to test these different scenarios.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch17ref29" id="rch17ref29">29</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent" id="page354">By February 2003, WMAP was brilliantly living up to its promise. Its data had allowed scientists to nail down precisely after many decades of controversy the age of the universe – 13.7 billion years – as well as the time in the universe’s history when patterns in the CMBR froze into place – 380,000 years after the Big Bang. WMAP results showed that space is flat and supported those who were insisting that most of the energy in the universe today is ‘dark energy’. WMAP measurements showed that the variations in temperature and density in the CMBR, observed across the sky – the variations that seeded the formation of galaxies – all had roughly the same amplitude regardless of their length, that all forms of energy had the same variation, and that the distribution of variations was random – just as predicted by the standard Big Bang inflationary model.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch17ref30" id="rch17ref30">30</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Nevertheless, important issues remained unresolved by that first February 2003 release of WMAP data. One key piece of evidence was missing: inflation theory makes predictions about what the patterns and characteristics of gravitational waves originating from the Big Bang should <span id="page355">be</span> like as they show up in the CMBR. WMAP had not yet found these gravitational wave footprints. Nor was it determined whether the dark energy was due to ‘vacuum energy’ – the cosmological constant – or ‘quintessence’. Interestingly, the observations that were fitting well with inflationary cosmology also fit a cyclical model where the universe expands from a big bang, eventually contracts again to a big crunch, and then reemerges in another big bang, in a cycle that keeps repeating itself – models which Neil Turok and Roger Penrose were favouring.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch17ref31" id="rch17ref31">31</a></sup></p>
<p class="h">Slowing down?</p>
<p class="noindent">Hawking made yet another excursion into popular culture in the spring of 2003 when he agreed to take part in a routine on <em class="calibre1">Late Night with Conan O’Brien</em>. Comedian Jim Carrey led off the sketch by discussing cosmology. A mobile phone rang. The caller was Stephen Hawking telling Carrey not to bother: ‘Their pea brains cannot possibly grasp the concept.’ Having said that, he quickly excused himself. He couldn’t stay on the phone because he was watching Carrey’s film <em class="calibre1">Dumb and Dumber</em>, stunned by the ‘pure genius of it’. Hawking’s travel schedule that year had him criss-crossing the world, from a month at the Mitchell Institute for Fundamental Physics at Texas A&amp;M to a meeting on cosmic inflation at the University of California-Davis, to Sweden to receive the Oskar Klein Medal from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and to attend a Nobel Symposium on String Theory and Cosmology, back to America for a two-month visit at Caltech and the University of California-Santa Barbara, then over to Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland.</p>
<p class="indent" id="page356">Unease among his physics colleagues that Stephen Hawking was slowing down seemed unfounded, given such a schedule, but they also feared he might be no longer at the height of his intellectual powers. In a poll taken among physicists at the end of the millennium asking who were the most influential physicists, Hawking’s name was not anywhere near the top. His use of the little ‘clicker’ that responded to his faint hand pressure – the only way he could communicate with colleagues – was becoming more and more difficult and slow. One way to get around this frustrating situation was to solicit the help of a research student. This time Hawking chose a young man named Christophe Galfard. The procedure would be for Hawking to consider a problem and suggest possible approaches to Galfard, who would then concentrate on the mathematical details to find out whether Hawking’s insights were correct and whether they led anywhere.</p>
<p class="indent">Galfard recalls that it took a while for him to get up to steam. Hawking’s ideas were coming much more rapidly than he could deal with them. In words that are encouraging to anyone like myself who has read Hawking’s papers and laboured to understand them, Galfard has described his chagrin as each sentence seemed to take about six months to decipher. He was lagging behind a half year and catching up was tough going.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch17ref32" id="rch17ref32">32</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">In the interest of moving things forward more rapidly, Galfard took a liberty that others had seldom taken – finishing sentences for Hawking when his intention was clear and he was struggling to select the words. In the past Hawking had often gone right ahead and completed the sentence, ignoring this second-guessing even when it was correct, but he allowed Galfard to expedite matters. <span id="page357">Galfard</span> also used Hawking’s ability to indicate ‘yes’ and ‘no’ with a small movement of his face, rather than wait for him to find the word on his screen. You wonder, seeing video clips of the two of them together, how Galfard avoided getting a bad crick in his neck as he bobbed back and forth between peering straight ahead at the computer screen and dipping forward to see Hawking’s face.</p>
<p class="indent">Galfard had his work cut out for him. In 2003, a young Argentinian physicist named Juan Martin Maldacena, at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Princeton, finally gave Leonard Susskind’s ideas for solving the information paradox a rigorous mathematical treatment that seemed to settle the issue in Susskind’s favour.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch17ref33" id="rch17ref33">33</a></sup> At a conference in Santa Barbara, after-dinner speaker Jeff Harvey, instead of giving the expected talk, introduced a victory song. ‘The Maldacena’ was set to the music of a Latin dance that was popular in the mid-1990s, the ‘Macarena’. Each short verse ended with ‘Ehhh! Maldacena!’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch17ref34" id="rch17ref34">34</a></sup> The audience enthusiastically joined in the singing and dancing, celebrating the rescue of physics from the ogre of the information paradox. Susskind declared the war over. It should have come to an end much earlier, he insisted, but Hawking ‘was like one of those unfortunate soldiers who wander in the jungle for years, not knowing that the hostilities have ended’.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch17ref35" id="rch17ref35">35</a></sup> Although a consensus was indeed growing that Hawking was wrong, Kip Thorne stuck with him. Hawking did not change his mind. Not yet.</p>
<p class="indent">He asked Galfard to study Maldacena’s paper about the information paradox. Hawking had decided nothing would do but a frontal attack on this piece that was convincing people he was wrong. It was not an easy <span id="page358">assignment</span>. After messing with it for a year and a half, Galfard still found it difficult to decide whether information was or was not lost in black holes.</p>
<p class="indent">On 1 December 2003, Hawking was rushed to the hospital with pneumonia. On life support for several weeks, while others feared he was probably on his deathbed, he didn’t waste the time. He spent it thinking about black holes, intent on finding a fresh approach to the information paradox. Recovery was slow, but after his discharge in the late winter of 2004 he and Galfard began again in earnest discussing the ideas those bedridden months had produced. After many gruellingly long days and late nights, including weekends when the work seemed never to stop,<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch17ref36" id="rch17ref36">36</a></sup> Hawking finally felt he was ready to emerge from the quiet refuge of his office and do battle.</p>
<p class="h">The Dublin Conference</p>
<p class="noindent">That spring of 2004, Hawking gave a seminar in Cambridge to introduce some of his new ideas in a preliminary, sketchy fashion, and he let it be known that he wished to address his physics colleagues at a major conference. There was just such an event coming up in July in Dublin, the 17th International Conference on General Relativity and Gravitation. Hawking contacted the Chair of the Scientific Committee of the conference, Curt Cutner, requesting a slot on the programme with the words ‘I have solved the black hole information problem and I want to talk about it.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch17ref37" id="rch17ref37">37</a></sup> It was a big favour to request, for Hawking’s paper was a late entry – participants had been asked to submit a title and abstract by 19 March, when he was barely out of the hospital. Also he would not be releasing a preprint of the paper. <span id="page359">Nevertheless</span>, his stature in the field won him an hour-long slot on the conference schedule.</p>
<p class="indent">The media and fan frenzy his appearance generated showed that Hawking’s superstar celebrity status had not waned. A public relations firm responsible for controlling access to the auditorium charged a reported £4,000, and it earned its fee as reporters and Hawking aficionados stormed the doors. Those fortunate enough to sport press badges soon lined the aisles inside, setting up their cameras and recording paraphernalia.</p>
<p class="indent">There was less excitement among Hawking’s colleagues, rightfully in the hall as conference participants, as they wondered what to expect. Bursts of camera flashes followed Hawking as he made his smooth, stately, frozen progress along the aisle to the foot of a ramp that led to the stage of the grand concert hall of the Royal Dublin Society. Some believed he was about to deliver a defiant statement that would reiterate what he had been saying for more than twenty years, that information is lost in black holes. Others thought this fading genius would quietly concede the issue. Kip Thorne, who had continued through the years to agree with Hawking about the loss of information in black holes, John Preskill, who had not, Petros Florides, who chaired the conference, and Christophe Galfard were waiting on stage, facing an array of TV cameras ready to record the event. It was not a normal day at a physics conference.</p>
<p class="indent">Only Galfard and Thorne knew that Hawking was about to make one of his famous about-faces, but not in the way anyone was expecting. He was not going to concede to Susskind and Maldacena. Yes, the idea he had stubbornly stuck with for more than twenty years was <span id="page360">wrong</span>. But Susskind and Maldacena hadn’t solved the problem. Hawking would do that himself. He had thought of another way to get round the information paradox.</p>
<p class="indent">The session began with an introduction by Petros Florides who quipped that while it is well known that no information can travel faster than the speed of light, this law seemed not to hold when it came to the speed at which the news of an upcoming Hawking appearance travels around the world.</p>
<p class="indent">It had become Hawking’s custom to introduce his lectures with the question, in his calm, mechanical voice, ‘Can you hear me?’ Presumably if you couldn’t, you wouldn’t answer, so there was usually either an agreeable murmur or a cheer in reply. After that trademark beginning, he began by laying out the problem and tracing the history of the information paradox all the way back to the mid-1960s, when it was discovered that all information about a body collapsing to form a black hole was lost from the outside region except for three things: mass, angular momentum and electric charge. John Wheeler called this discovery ‘black holes have no hair’, and it has been ever since known as the ‘no hair theorem’.</p>
<p class="indent">None of this presented a problem for information conservation. A classical black hole would last for ever preserving the information inside it, inaccessible, but there. Still part of the universe. The problem had emerged when Hawking discovered that quantum effects would cause a black hole to radiate at a steady rate – the famous Hawking radiation. That radiation carries no information about what made the black hole or what has fallen in. Still no problem until you realize that in this process <span id="page361">the</span> black hole would eventually evaporate away and disappear entirely. <em class="calibre1">Then</em> what would happen to all that information locked inside? It seemed the only way the information could avoid being lost would be if the Hawking radiation had subtle differences in it that would reflect what had fallen in. No one had found any way for such differences to be produced, though many physicists believed one must exist. Hawking’s calculations, however, showed that the radiation was exactly thermal, random and featureless.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch17ref38" id="rch17ref38">38</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent-bs">In case anyone was wondering whether a baby universe branching off a black hole might solve the information loss problem, Hawking brought them up to date:</p>
<p class="quote-jy-bs">There is no baby universe branching off inside a black hole, as I once thought. The information remains firmly in our universe. I’m sorry to disappoint science fiction fans, but if information is preserved, there is no possibility of using black holes to travel to other universes. If you jump into a black hole, your mass energy will be returned to our universe, but in a mangled form, which contains the information about what you were like, but in an unrecognizable state.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch17ref39" id="rch17ref39">39</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Some in the audience must have pricked up their ears at that. Was Hawking about to say that Hawking radiation could after all be the vehicle of escape and that, as in the description earlier about restoring a burned book, it might at least in principle be possible to recover from that radiation the information hidden in a black hole?</p>
<p class="indent">Hawking’s new solution to the problem had to do with something else, the possibility that a black hole could have <span id="page362">more</span> than one geometry (topology) at the same time. Information would not be trapped because a true event horizon would not form.</p>
<p class="indent-bs">Christophe Galfard remembers that Hawking’s talk seemed to leave most of his physics audience ‘largely bemused’. There were whispers of ‘big on claims, short on mathematics … not really all that convincing … mostly smoke and mirrors’. Kip Thorne commented: ‘This looks to me on the face of it to be a lovely argument, but I haven’t yet seen all the details.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch17ref40" id="rch17ref40">40</a></sup> He said he would have to take some time with Hawking’s paper before he could say whether or not Hawking was right. Roger Penrose was not convinced: ‘It seems to me that the indication that the information is lost is very powerful, and that is what Stephen originally thought. In Dublin he publicly retracted. In my view he was completely wrong to retract. He should have stuck to his guns.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch17ref41" id="rch17ref41">41</a></sup> Hawking, though he expressed intentions of trying to support his idea with a mathematical proof, was convinced enough of his conclusions to concede a bet that he and Kip Thorne had made with John Preskill of Caltech. The bet read as follows:</p>
<p class="quote-jy">Whereas Stephen Hawking and Kip Thorne firmly believe that information swallowed by a black hole is for ever hidden from the outside universe, and can never be revealed even as the black hole evaporates and completely disappears,</p>
<p class="quote-indent-jy">And whereas John Preskill firmly believes that a mechanism for the information to be released by the evaporating black hole must and will be found in the correct theory of quantum gravity,</p>
<p class="quote-indent-jy" id="page363">Therefore Preskill offers, and Hawking/Thorne accept, a wager that:</p>
<p class="quote-indent-jy">When an initial pure quantum state undergoes gravitational collapse to form a black hole, the final state at the end of black hole evaporation will always be a pure quantum state.</p>
<p class="quote-indent-jy-bs">The loser(s) will reward the winner(s) with an encyclopedia of the winner’s choice, from which information can be recovered at will.</p>
<p class="noindent">The document had been signed by all three men, Stephen Hawking’s signature being his thumbprint, and dated 6 February 1997, Pasadena, California.</p>
<p class="indent">Hawking ended his talk saying, ‘I will give John Preskill the encyclopedia he has requested. John is all-American, so naturally he wants an encyclopedia of baseball. I had great difficulty in finding one over here, so I offered him an encyclopedia of cricket, as an alternative, but John wouldn’t be persuaded of the superiority of cricket. Fortunately, my assistant, Andrew Dunn, persuaded the publishers Sportclassic Books to fly a copy of “Total Baseball: The Ultimate Baseball Encyclopedia” to Dublin. I will give John the encyclopedia now. If Kip agrees to concede the bet later, he can pay me back.’ Thorne was not convinced that Hawking, or anyone else, had solved the problem of the information paradox. The encyclopedia was brought on stage, and John Preskill held it over his head as though he were holding the men’s tennis championship trophy at Wimbledon.</p>
<p class="indent">Hawking later commented on the occasion in a lecture he gave at Caltech the following January, in 2005: ‘The [information loss] paradox had been argued for thirty years <span id="page364">without</span> much progress until I found what I think was its resolution. Information is not lost, but it is not returned in a useful way. It is like burning an encyclopedia. Information is not lost, but it is very hard to read. I gave John Preskill a baseball encyclopedia. Maybe I should have just given him the ashes.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch17ref42" id="rch17ref42">42</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Hawking had promised to provide his colleagues with a fuller explanation. It would take the form of a paper published in October 2005.</p>
