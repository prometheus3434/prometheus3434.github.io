<p class="noindent">All of Stephen Hawking’s non-academic books (listed in Bibliography below). <em class="calibre1">Black Holes and Baby Universes</em> and <em class="calibre1">A Brief History of Time: A Reader’s Companion</em> include particularly interesting accounts (autobiographical and from relatives and close acquaintances) of his childhood and university years and his life outside of science.</p>
<p class="indent">Jane Hawking’s two memoirs, <em class="calibre1">Music to Move the Stars</em> and <em class="calibre1">Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen</em>. These provide the most in-depth account ever likely to be written of their life together.</p>
<p class="indent">The three children’s books on which Lucy Hawking and Stephen Hawking have collaborated. Though fictional, these include superb explanations at a non-academic level of the science that has most interested Stephen Hawking: <em class="calibre1">George’s Secret Key to the Universe</em>, <em class="calibre1">George’s Cosmic Treasure Hunt</em>, and <em class="calibre1">George and the Big Bang</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">Kristine Larsen’s excellent, succinct biography, <em class="calibre1">Stephen Hawking: A Biography</em>, written by a scientist who works in Stephen Hawking’s field and writes well for non-scientists.</p>
