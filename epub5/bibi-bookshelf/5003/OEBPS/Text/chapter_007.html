<p class="chaptitle">‘These people must think we are used to an astronomical standard of living’</p>
<p class="noindent"><span><span class="small">WHEN LUCY WAS</span></span> born on 2 november 1970, the Hawkings had recently purchased the house they had been renting in Little St Mary’s Lane. Stephen’s parents had given them money to fix it up and qualify for a mortgage. The work had finally been completed when Jane was eight months pregnant.</p>
<p class="indent">Stephen was still insisting on pulling himself up and down the stairs and dressing himself in the morning and undressing at night. His comment that he had plenty of time to think about photons at the event horizons of black holes while getting ready for bed is one of very few admissions he has made that any of this was extremely slow and arduous. His walking, however, finally became so perilous that he consented to a wheelchair. He’d lost the battle to stay on his feet. Friends watched with sadness, but <span id="page132">Hawking’s</span> humour and strength of purpose didn’t fail him.</p>
<p class="indent">Hawking’s loss of the use of his hands, meaning he could no longer write and draw equations and diagrams, did not happen overnight. Over the years of gradual loss, he had time to adapt and train ‘his mind to think in a manner different from the minds of other physicists. He thinks in new types of intuitive mental pictures and mental equations that, for him, have replaced paper-and pen drawings and written equations,’ said Kip Thorne.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch7ref1" id="rch7ref1">1</a></sup> Listening to Hawking himself, you get the impression that he believes he might have chosen this way of working even if he had full use of his hands: ‘Equations are just the boring part of mathematics. I prefer to see things in terms of geometry.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch7ref2" id="rch7ref2">2</a></sup> The calculations involved in the discovery of Hawking radiation were done almost entirely in his head.</p>
<p class="indent">After Lucy’s birth, Jane was juggling an all but impossible schedule, trying to finish her Ph.D. thesis while caring for Stephen, her toddler Robert and now her new baby girl. Her mother and a neighbour’s nanny helped with the children whenever they could. The cottage in Little St Mary’s Lane was a delight. As the children grew and Lucy became a proficient toddler, she joined her brother to play among the flowering plants and ancient stone markers in the Little St Mary’s churchyard across the lane. Jane remembers summers with the windows open and the happy voices of her children ‘piping in the churchyard’.</p>
<p class="indent">When Hawking’s January 1971 entry in the yearly Gravity Research Foundation Award, titled ‘Black Holes’, won top prize, the prize money allowed the Hawkings to buy a new car. Hawking had a salary from Caius and <span id="page133">research</span> assistantships from the DAMTP and the Institute of Astronomy. However, the family budget was still tight and not adequate to pay for a private school for Robert when he reached school age. He began instead at the fine local school, Newnham Croft Primary School, which my own daughter would attend fifteen years later. Robert seemed to be following in his father’s footsteps, excelling in maths and slow learning to read, but it was a new era, when ‘slow learning to read’ was not to be accepted without taking proactive steps. Together with Stephen’s parents, Jane and Stephen bought half shares in a small terraced house. The rent from it would provide money for Robert’s fees at a private school where his mathematical prowess could be particularly respected and encouraged, as well as a retirement income for his grandparents.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch7ref3" id="rch7ref3">3</a></sup> Robert transferred to the Perse School in Cambridge when he was seven.</p>
<p class="indent">The Hawkings continued to try to keep Stephen’s illness in the background of their lives and not allow it to become the most important thing about him or about them. They made a habit of not looking to the future. As far as the rest of the world could see, they succeeded so well that it came as a surprise when Jane Hawking mentioned how terrible the difficulties sometimes were. Discussing honours that had come her husband’s way, she told an interviewer: ‘I wouldn’t say [this overwhelming success makes] all the blackness worthwhile. I don’t think I am ever going to reconcile in my mind the swings of the pendulum we have experienced from the depths of a black hole to the heights of all the glittering prizes.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch7ref4" id="rch7ref4">4</a></sup> To judge from everything Stephen Hawking has written, he barely noticed the depths. Talking about them in any but the most <span id="page134">offhand</span> manner, which is the most he allows himself, would be for him a form of giving in, of defeat, and could undermine his resolute disregard of his problems. Most of the time, he continued to refuse to discuss his illness even with Jane, but that didn’t, for her, make it any less the gorilla in the room.</p>
<p class="indent">Jane remembers that being unable to assist with his children or play with them in an active way was difficult for Stephen. She taught Robert, and later Lucy and Timmy, to play cricket (’I can get them out!’ she gloated), and she teased her husband that, unlike other wives, she was not surprised or disillusioned when he proved useless around the house and with the children.</p>
<p class="indent">Hawking’s practical uselessness became one of the positive side effects of his illness. It might take him a long time to get up and go to bed, but he didn’t have to run errands, do home repairs, mow the grass, make travel arrangements, pack his suitcase, draw up lecture schedules or serve in time-consuming administrative positions in the <span><span class="small">DAMTP</span></span> or at Caius. Such matters were left to colleagues and assistants and to his wife. He could spend all his time thinking about physics, a luxury which his colleagues envy him.</p>
<p class="indent">Jane had anticipated that an overwhelming proportion of these day-to-day responsibilities would fall to her. She had decided even before they were married in the 1960s that only one of them would be able to have a career, and it would have to be her husband. In the 1970s, perhaps partly because attitudes about the role of women were changing, that sacrifice became more difficult for her to accept. She’d thought that providing Stephen with the encouragement and assistance he so badly needed would <span id="page135">give</span> her life purpose and meaning. What it was not giving her was an identity. Motherhood wasn’t doing that either. As she put it, although she adored her children and ‘would not have wanted to farm them out to anybody else, Cambridge is a jolly difficult place to live if your only identity is as the mother of small children’.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch7ref5" id="rch7ref5">5</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">To be fair to the university community, whenever you mentioned the name Hawking in Cambridge someone was likely to comment that Jane Hawking was even more remarkable than Stephen. However, Jane Hawking didn’t feel that was her reputation. As she saw it, in Cambridge ‘the pressure is on you to make your way academically’.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch7ref6" id="rch7ref6">6</a></sup> That of course was the reason she had decided to go back to university to earn her Ph.D., but her drafts for that thesis were far too often languishing on the shelf.</p>
<p class="indent">Jane had much to be proud of in the 1970s. Robert and Lucy were turning out well; Hawking’s career as a physicist was skyrocketing; his reputation as a remarkably tough and good-humoured man when the odds were against him was becoming legendary; and she was beginning to make her own mark academically. At the same time she felt increasingly that her enormous and burdensome role in Hawking’s success went largely unnoticed. Hers was a problem which is not unusual for persons with a talent for making things look easy: others begin to assume that things <em class="calibre1">are</em> easy for them and fail to appreciate the sacrifice and effort involved. Both Jane and her husband knew that none of his success – probably not even his survival – could have happened without her, but she was allowed to share little of the triumph. In photos of him she was sometimes cropped out, thought to be a nurse pushing his wheelchair. Nor could she follow his <span id="page136">mathematical</span> reasoning and share his pleasure in that. Nevertheless, ‘the joy and excitement of Stephen’s success were tremendous’,<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch7ref7" id="rch7ref7">7</a></sup> she says. She did not regret the decision she made to marry him, but the rewards ‘didn’t alleviate the heartrending difficulties of coping day after day with motor neurone disease’.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch7ref8" id="rch7ref8">8</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">In spite of the difficulties there were many pleasures the Hawkings shared. Both of them were devoted to their children. They loved classical music and attended concerts and the theatre together. At Christmas they took Robert and Lucy to the pantomime. They also loved entertaining. Don Page, who as a postgraduate researcher would live with the Hawkings for three years as Hawking’s assistant, remembers that Jane Hawking was ‘very outgoing … a great professional asset’ to her husband.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch7ref9" id="rch7ref9">9</a></sup> It wasn’t unheard of to find her in the market shopping for a party of sixty people. The Hawkings became renowned for their hospitality.</p>
<p class="indent">Both of them were also deeply interested in increasing public awareness of the needs of disabled people and the possibility that they might expect to live normal, even brilliantly successful and active lives. This was not so much a part of our culture in the 1970s as it is becoming today. Britain had passed its Chronically Sick and Disabled Person’s Act in 1970, but that was very slow in implementation. Occasionally, Jane Hawking felt indignant enough to protest. She wrote a letter to the board of the National Trust when Anglesey Abbey, a house and gardens open to visitors near Cambridge, insisted the Hawkings park in a car park half a mile away, not near the house.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch7ref10" id="rch7ref10">10</a></sup> Jane was soon adding campaigning for the rights of disabled people to her already over-long list of activities.</p>
<p class="indent-bs" id="page137">The Hawkings won some battles for wheelchair access. After a lengthy bureaucratic dispute about who should pay for it, a ramp was built at the back entrance into the <span><span class="small">DAMTP</span></span> building. The Arts Theatre began reserving spaces for wheelchairs. The Arts Cinema also made room. Elsewhere, the English National Opera at the Coliseum made access possible. Where there was no such access, anyone near at hand was likely to be conscripted to lift Hawking and his chair up and down stairs. At Clare Hall, a graduate college of the University of Cambridge, members of the Astronomy Group were regularly called upon for this duty before and after their meetings. It wasn’t always a safe procedure. Attendants at the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden dropped Stephen while carrying him up a flight of stairs to otherwise inaccessible seats.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch7ref11" id="rch7ref11">11</a></sup></p>
<p class="h">Faith in God and the Laws of Physics</p>
<p class="noindent">Looking back in the late 1980s, Jane Hawking attributed her ability to cope for so many years with their unusual and often difficult life – a life with no hope of a long or happy future – to her faith in God. Without that, she said, ‘I wouldn’t have been able to live in this situation. I wouldn’t have been able to marry Stephen in the first place, because I wouldn’t have had the optimism to carry me through, and I wouldn’t be able to carry on with it.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch7ref12" id="rch7ref12">12</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">The faith which supported her so magnificently was not shared by her husband. It was shared by some of his physics colleagues, but the subject was not one she usually discussed with them. If there has been a religious or philosophical side to Stephen Hawking’s confrontation with disability and the threat of early death, he’s never spoken about that publicly. However, it seems evident from his <span id="page138">books</span> <em class="calibre1">A Brief History of Time</em> and <em class="calibre1">The Grand Design</em> that God is never far from Hawking’s mind. He told an interviewer in the 1980s: ‘It is difficult to discuss the beginning of the universe without mentioning the concept of God. My work on the origin of the universe is on the borderline between science and religion, but I try to stay [on the scientific] side of the border. It is quite possible that God acts in ways that cannot be described by scientific laws. But in that case one would just have to go by personal belief.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch7ref13" id="rch7ref13">13</a></sup> Asked whether he thought his science is in competition with religion, he answered, ‘If one took that attitude, then Newton [who was a very religious man] would not have discovered the law of gravity.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch7ref14" id="rch7ref14">14</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Hawking said he wasn’t an atheist, but he preferred to ‘use the term God as the embodiment of the laws of physics’.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch7ref15" id="rch7ref15">15</a></sup> ‘You don’t need to appeal to God to set the initial conditions for the universe, but that doesn’t prove there is no God – only that he acts through the laws of physics.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch7ref16" id="rch7ref16">16</a></sup> However, Hawking definitely did not believe in a personal God who cares for human beings as individuals, relates to them in a powerful and transforming way, and performs miracles. ‘We are such insignificant creatures on a minor planet of a very average star in the outer suburbs of one of a hundred thousand million galaxies. So it is difficult to believe in a God that would care about us or even notice our existence.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch7ref17" id="rch7ref17">17</a></sup> Einstein shared Hawking’s view. Others, including some of Hawking’s physics colleagues, would agree with Jane Hawking and call this a sadly limited view of God, pointing out that it’s equally difficult to believe that all the intelligent and rational people (a good many scientists among them) who say they have experienced a personal <span id="page139">God</span> are somehow deluded. This enormous difference in outlook could hardly have been illustrated more strikingly than in the views of Stephen and Jane Hawking.</p>
<p class="indent">‘I used to find Stephen’s assertion that he doesn’t believe in a personal God quite hurtful,’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch7ref18" id="rch7ref18">18</a></sup> Jane remembers. She would tell an interviewer in 1988: ‘He is delving into realms that really do matter to thinking people and in a way that can have a very disturbing effect on people. There’s one aspect of his thought that I find increasingly upsetting and difficult to live with. It’s the feeling that, because everything is reduced to a rational, mathematical formula, that must be the truth.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch7ref19" id="rch7ref19">19</a></sup> It seemed to her that there was no room in her husband’s mind for the possibility that the truth revealed in his mathematics might not be the whole truth. A year later she had changed her outlook somewhat: ‘As one grows older it’s easier to take a broader view. I think the whole picture for him is so different from the whole picture for anybody else by virtue of his condition and his circumstances … being an almost totally paralysed genius … that nobody else can understand what his view of God or what his relationship with God might be.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch7ref20" id="rch7ref20">20</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent-bs">Truth might have to be mathematical, but physics, for Hawking, was not all there was to life. ‘Physics,’ he told an interviewer, ‘is all very well, but it is completely cold. I couldn’t carry on with my life if I only had physics. Like everyone else, I need warmth, love, and affection.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch7ref21" id="rch7ref21">21</a></sup></p>
<p class="h">An Unusual Asset</p>
<p class="noindent">In the late 1960s it had perhaps been generous of Hawking’s college and university departments to keep on a young physicist who hadn’t long to live, who might <span id="page140">contribute</span> little to his department in terms of lecturing and teaching. The DAMTP had from the beginning exempted Hawking from heavy teaching duties and allowed him to concentrate on his research and a few seminars and graduate students. By the mid-1970s Caius and the University had begun to realize that they’d done themselves a favour. He’d become a considerable asset.</p>
<p class="indent">However, at Cambridge extraordinary minds and personalities aren’t uncommon. They crop up in one university department or another on a regular basis. It’s a healthy environment for genius. No matter how much one is treated with awe in the wider world, within the university community it’s generally just business as usual. Even in the late 1970s, when Hawking had become something of a legend, he and all his specialized equipment – gadgets to turn pages for him, computer terminals with special controls so that he could use them like a blackboard – still shared a cramped office with another researcher.</p>
<p class="indent">His communication problems were growing more severe. Earlier in the 1970s it was still possible to carry on a normal conversation with Hawking. However, by the late 1970s and early 1980s, when his speech was so slurred that only his family and closest friends could understand him, the job of ‘interpreter’ frequently fell to a research student. Michael Harwood, who later interviewed Hawking for <em class="calibre1">The New York Times</em>, described the process: ‘Don Page, sitting beside him, leans close to hear the indistinct words, mouths each phrase to be certain he has caught it, often pauses and asks for a repetition, speaks a phrase back to Hawking sometimes to make certain, corrects himself.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch7ref22" id="rch7ref22">22</a></sup> Another interviewer recalls that he <span id="page141">often</span> thought Hawking had finished a sentence only to find with the ‘interpretation’ that he’d spoken just one word. Hawking wrote his scientific papers by dictating them in this tedious fashion to his secretary. But he was learning to state ideas in the fewest words possible and to get to the point in scientific papers and conversations.</p>
<p class="indent">What he was saying in those few words was receiving worldwide attention. The procession of awards and recognition had escalated soon after Hawking announced his discovery of exploding black holes. In the spring of 1974 he was inducted into the Royal Society, one of the world’s most prestigious bodies of scientists. At thirty-two he was young for the honour. During the rite of investiture, a ceremony dating from the seventeenth century, new Fellows walk to the podium to write their names in a book the earliest pages of which contain the signature of Isaac Newton. Those present when Hawking was inducted remember that the president of the society, Sir Alan Hodgkin, Nobel Prize winner in biology, broke tradition and carried the book down to Hawking in the front row. Hawking could still write his name with great effort, but it took him a long time. The gathering of eminent scientists waited respectfully. When Hawking finished and looked up with a broad grin, they gave him an ovation.</p>
<p class="indent">That same spring, the Hawkings enthusiastically accepted an invitation from the California Institute of Technology, where Kip Thorne was a professor, to spend the academic year 1974–5 there.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch7ref23" id="rch7ref23">23</a></sup> Hawking would be a Sherman Fairchild Distinguished Scholar. The offer included an excellent salary, a house, a car and even a new electric wheelchair. All medical expenses would be <span id="page142">covered</span> (the British National Health did not cover expenses out of the country) as well as schooling for Robert and Lucy.</p>
<p class="indent">In the spring when that offer came, it had been almost four years since the Hawkings had purchased and renovated their house in Little St Mary’s Lane. Stephen’s trips up and down the stairs, by this time accomplished by grasping the posts that held up the banister and using only the strength of his arms to pull himself up step by step to the second floor, had for a time been good physical therapy. They were finally proving impossible. Caius College chose to be more helpful with housing than they had been when the Hawkings were newlyweds. There was a new bursar, who offered them a spacious ground-floor flat in a college-owned brick mansion on West Road, not far from the back gate of King’s College. The arrangement in this house, with a faculty family having the rather elegant although sometimes a bit run-down-around-the-edges lower floors, with graduate students in rooms above, was not unusual at that time in Cambridge. The flat Caius offered had high ceilings and large windows and required only a little modification and renovation to make it more suitable for the family and convenient for a wheelchair. This work could be completed while the Hawkings were in California. They would be able to move in when they returned. Except for a gravel parking area in front, the house was surrounded by gardens tended by Caius College gardeners, who were also willing to listen to suggestions and gardening plans from Jane Hawking. It would be an ideal childhood home for the Hawking children.</p>
<p class="indent">Even though he had given up on stair climbing, <span id="page143">Hawking</span> could still feed himself and get into and out of bed, but these actions too were becoming increasingly difficult. Jane was still managing without outside help, working on overdrive to try to keep his life as normal as it could be with his worsening condition, make it possible for him to continue his work, and at the same time see that Robert and Lucy weren’t robbed of a normal childhood. She had also occasionally been finding time to work on her thesis. But the Hawkings both knew that something had to change.</p>
<p class="indent">Planning ahead for the trip to California, Jane, over the Easter holiday, suggested a new solution for caring for Stephen – one that he could accept without feeling it represented a concession and courage-sapping defeat. They would begin a custom of asking a graduate student or a postdoctoral research student to live and travel with them. In return for free accommodation and extra attention from Hawking, the student would help him get ready for bed and get up. When the Hawkings departed for California, one of his graduate students, Bernard Carr, would go with them.</p>
<p class="indent-bs">Jane Hawking booked flights and, with Bernard Carr’s help, packed and moved belongings, two small children, husband and specialized equipment across the world to southern California with an efficiency that awed her friends.</p>
<p class="h">A Place in the Sun</p>
<p class="noindent">In August 1974, Kip Thorne met the Hawkings at Los Angeles airport in a gleaming new American station wagon that would be theirs for the length of their stay. It had been a long flight, over the North Pole from London, but the <span id="page144">family</span> revived in the languid air of southern California as Kip manoeuvred the freeways through the sprawling city with its skyscrapers and amazingly tall palm trees to Pasadena, ten miles north-east of downtown Los Angeles.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch7ref24" id="rch7ref24">24</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">They arrived, just at dusk, at the house that had been arranged for them – a lovely home with white weather-boarding, lights gleaming in every window. The house was across the street from the Caltech campus and had a view of the mountains. Jane described it in a letter she wrote on that first day to her parents back in England: ‘It is as elegant inside as it is pretty out. These people must think we are used to an astronomical standard of living. If only they knew!’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch7ref25" id="rch7ref25">25</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Stephen, Jane and their children discovered hummingbirds on the patio, a huge climbable California oak tree in the garden, a television and several bathrooms. There was a swimming pool nearby on campus. You could easily drive to Disneyland. Stephen’s new, state-of-the-art electric wheelchair was waiting for him. Like a racing car driver testing a new, faster, more manoeuvrable model, Hawking zoomed around, finding out what it could do, stopping to allow engineers to make adjustments.</p>
<p class="indent">As the Hawkings settled into their California life, a new and rather disturbing experience, which they had known to expect, was the frequent tremors and occasionally a rather startling earthquake. Their neighbours and Hawking’s colleagues at Caltech seemed to take these in their stride and assured Jane and Stephen that small, frequent tremors made it less likely there would be a big, dangerous quake. The house and its occupants would make it through the year with no damage.</p>
<p class="indent">Robert’s and Lucy’s school was the Pasadena Town and <span id="page145">Country</span> School. Three-year-old Lucy liked it so much the first day that she made up her mind she would stay the full day rather than the half-day she was assigned. She was nowhere to be found when her mother came to fetch her. A panicked staff discovered Lucy having her lunch calmly in the lunch room with the older children. Robert found a new role, making himself invaluable to his mother as a master navigator of the Los Angeles freeways with, seemingly, a detailed map in his seven-year-old head. Bernard Carr dived into Caltech student life with a passion and went out to parties nearly every evening after getting Hawking to bed. After the parties he sat up the rest of the night watching horror movies. Fortunately Stephen also was not fond of getting up early in the morning.</p>
<p class="indent">Jane was caught up in a social whirl and the Hawkings entertained almost constantly. It is rare in the Cambridge colleges, with the notable exception of Clare Hall, for spouses to be nearly as much a part of the social scene as Jane experienced at Caltech. She found the change exhilarating, if also a little exhausting. In addition to new local friends, there were visitors from abroad, friends and family including Jane’s parents and Stephen’s mother and aunt. Stephen’s sister Philippa visited from New York, where she was living. The Hawking home, so convenient to the campus, was the site of frequent parties for the Caltech Relativity Group.</p>
<p class="indent">The spontaneity and directness of Californians were a surprise and, to Jane, a pleasant change from the diffidence and, sometimes, outright avoidance she and her husband were used to encountering in England. It was not easy, because of Stephen’s speech problems, for those who did not know them well to carry on a conversation with the <span id="page146">pair</span> of them, but Californians seemed more than willing to try. Stephen Hawking was becoming an international celebrity in his field when he arrived at Caltech and he was, accordingly, given star treatment. To be fair, had he been introduced to Cambridge similarly for the first time, his and Jane’s reception in University circles might have been characterized by some of the special attention they experienced in Pasadena.</p>
<p class="indent">For an academic taking a sabbatical year abroad, the time spent away from home is often not only an enormous boost to his or her creativity and intellectual energy, but also a watershed for other members of the family. So it was with the Hawkings. An eight-year-old computer-wiz friend got Robert excited about the field that would eventually become his career, information technology. Another faculty wife invited Jane to attend an evening choral class that met each week to sing through a major choral work – Jane’s first introduction to an avocation that would become her passion and engage her for many years.</p>
<p class="indent">Hawking had an air-conditioned office, and ramps sprang up all over the Caltech campus. He basked in the company of other eminent researchers and dined as an honoured, delighted guest in the student ‘houses’. The California Institute of Technology was and is one of the greatest centres in the world for the study of physics and physics research. It is a smaller institution than Cambridge or Oxford, but the faculty includes many of the world’s most outstanding academics, undisputed leaders in their fields. For Hawking, new colleagues and stimulating ideas abounded, drawing his interest to areas he hadn’t explored and to fresh ways of approaching the problems he was already working on. It was here that he <span id="page147">first</span> met Don Page, then a Caltech graduate student, who would play a large role in the Hawkings’ future. Page and Hawking wrote a paper that year which suggested that the explosion of primordial black holes might be observed as gamma ray bursts.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch7ref26" id="rch7ref26">26</a></sup> Legendary arch-rivals Richard Feynman and Murray Gell-Mann were also at Caltech, and Hawking attended their lectures. Both were cutting-edge particle physicists, not cosmologists, but Hawking was finding more and more need for expertise in particle physics in his study of black holes, and here was a priceless opportunity. He would soon be employing Feynman’s idea of ‘sums-over-histories’ in a new way as he explored possibilities for describing the origin of the universe. Jim Hartle, whom Hawking had met in Cambridge and who was at the University of California-Santa Barbara, spent some time at Caltech that year, and he and Hawking developed the description of Hawking radiation discussed in <a href="../Text/chapter_006_split_000.html">Chapter 6</a>.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch7ref27" id="rch7ref27">27</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Hawking didn’t spend the entire year, uninterrupted, in Pasadena. Just before Christmas he joined his friend and colleague George Ellis to attend a conference in Dallas, and in April he was invited to Rome to receive, from Pope Paul VI, the Pope Pius XII medal, awarded ‘to a young scientist for distinguished work’. Hawking was eager to see the document in the Vatican Library in which Galileo had recanted, under extreme pressure and threat of torture, his discovery that the Earth goes around the sun. Hawking took the opportunity to lobby for a formal apology to Galileo, whom the Catholic Church had treated so badly three and a half centuries before. That apology would not be long in coming.</p>
<p class="indent">It was in California that Hawking began to think <span id="page148">seriously</span> about a problem which would set him at odds with some of his colleagues for many years: the loss of information in black holes. We will examine later what ‘information’ means in this context. For now, think of it as information having to do with everything that went into the making of the black hole when it formed and everything that has fallen in since. How irrevocable is this loss? What might it mean for our ability to understand the universe and make predictions? Could it really represent the breakdown of physics? That was the title he gave a paper he wrote that year – ‘Breakdown of Physics in Gravitational Collapse’. When it finally appeared in November 1976, he had changed the title to something less shocking, unless you stopped to think about it: ‘Breakdown of Predictability in Gravitational Collapse’.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch7ref28" id="rch7ref28">28</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent-bs">And, of course, there was Kip Thorne, the dear friend and colleague who had been instrumental in making the whole visit possible. Thorne and Hawking put their signatures (Hawking’s thumb print) to a document recording their first famous bet, about whether the binary star system Cygnus X-1 contains a black hole.</p>
<p class="h"><em class="calibre1">Penthouse v. Private Eye</em></p>
<p class="noindent">The pre-history of Thorne’s and Hawking’s bet began in 1964, before John Wheeler had even coined the name black hole. That year Yakov Zel’dovich and his graduate student Oktay Guseinov at the Institute of Applied Mathematics in Moscow began combing the lists of many hundreds of binary star systems that astronomers had previously observed and catalogued. They were looking for stars so extremely massive and compact that they are unlikely to be anything but black holes. The search for <span id="page149">black</span> hole candidates had begun, and it was no straightforward undertaking. Such candidates are, by nature, invisible to an optical telescope.</p>
<p class="indent">In order to understand what binary star systems are and why they are good places to look for black holes, picture a scene described by John Wheeler. In a dimly lit ballroom, the women are all dressed in white gowns. Some of the men are also dressed in white, but a few of them are in black formal attire. Watching the couples waltz, from a balcony above, we know there are two people in each pair, but in some cases we can see only one of them, the woman in white.</p>
<p class="indent">A binary star system consists of two stars circling one another, as the man and woman in one of Wheeler’s couples do. In some binary systems, only one star is visible. How do we know that there <em class="calibre1">are</em> two stars? In the ballroom, by watching how the visible woman moves, it’s fairly obvious that she must have a partner. Likewise, by studying the movement of some stars, it is possible to conclude that they are not alone out there.</p>
<p class="indent">Seeing a star apparently alone but moving as though it has a partner does not always signify a black hole. The invisible companion might be a small, dim, low-temperature star – a white dwarf, or a neutron star. Calculating the mass of such stars is complicated, and mass is a vital statistic when you’re trying to determine whether something is a black hole or not. Suffice it to say that, again, this was information that astronomers in the 1960s were beginning to find ingenious ways to glean from the movements of the visible star.</p>
<p class="indent">In 1966, Zel’dovich and another colleague, Igor Novikov, decided that identifying strong black hole <span id="page150">candidates</span> would require using both optical telescopes and X-ray detectors. The observation of X-rays indicates a source of considerable energy powering their emission, and having material fall towards a black hole or neutron star is one of the best ways known to liberate energy. In a binary system, that is what happens when the very compact star or black hole pulls material away from its companion star. So researchers looked for binary systems where one partner shows up brightly in the visible part of the spectrum but is dark in the X-ray part; while the other partner is dark in the visible part of the spectrum but bright in the X-ray part.</p>
<p class="indent">Cygnus X-1 was a very promising candidate. Here was a binary system where an optically bright but X-ray dark star orbits with an optically dark but X-ray bright companion. This system is in our galaxy, about 6,000 light years from Earth. The two stars complete one orbit in 5.6 days. An optical telescope reveals what seems to be a blue giant star, too dim to be detected with the naked eye. Studies of the Doppler shift in its light show that it must have a companion. Cygnus X-1 is that companion. It can’t be seen at all with an optical telescope, but it is one of the brightest objects in the X-ray sky. The X-ray emission fluctuates violently and chaotically, as expected when matter falls towards a black hole or neutron star. Cygnus X-1’s mass is at a minimum 3 solar masses, probably greater than 7 solar masses, and most likely about 16 solar masses. In December 1974, such uncertainty in calculations of its mass made the Hawking–Thorne bet possible. Cygnus X-1 was an excellent black hole candidate, but experts were only about 80 per cent certain that it was a black hole and not a neutron star.</p>
<p class="indent" id="page151">The bet document laid out the terms: If Cygnus X-1 turned out to be a black hole, Hawking would give Thorne a one-year subscription to the magazine <em class="calibre1">Penthouse</em>. If it turned out not to be a black hole, Thorne would give Hawking a four-year subscription to <em class="calibre1">Private Eye</em>. Hawking called his surprising bet <em class="calibre1">against</em> Cygnus X-1 being a black hole an ‘insurance policy’. ‘I have done a lot of work on black holes, and it would all be wasted if it turned out that black holes do not exist. But in that case, I would have the consolation of winning my bet.’ The bet document was framed and hung on the wall of Thorne’s office at Caltech, awaiting the advancement of science.</p>
<p class="indent">Sadly, as the year in California approached its end, the feelings of depression, inadequacy and low self-esteem that had plagued Jane back in Cambridge caught up with her again. She began to reassess the social whirl of that year in Pasadena and view it as a sort of frenzied escapism from these problems. She felt she had fallen easy prey to the women’s liberation movement’s insistence that a woman who had no job outside her home should consider herself a failure, lacking in personal fulfilment.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch7ref29" id="rch7ref29">29</a></sup> Jane concluded this was indeed the prevalent feeling among unemployed faculty wives she had met. Excursions with them to art museums and galleries and plays now seemed only the sad, kindly attempts of these women to make up for the bleakness of their lives and hers. A thoughtful and discerning friend, recognizing Jane for the remarkable woman she was, and perhaps sensing that she was not capable of recognizing this herself, gave her a pearl brooch on the day that Stephen Hawking was awarded his Papal medal, saying that she, Jane, should be given something too.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch7ref30" id="rch7ref30">30</a></sup></p>
