<p class="noindent"><span><span class="small">I WISH TO THANK STEPHEN HAWKING FOR HIS TIME AND</span></span> patience in helping me understand his theories, and for putting up with some terribly na√Øve questions from me.</p>
<p class="indent">I am grateful to my agents, Brie Burkeman and Rita Rosenkranz, and my editors, Sally Gaminara at Transworld Publishers and Luba Ostashevsky at Palgrave Macmillan.</p>
<p class="indent">I am also grateful to the following for their assistance in many ways, including reading and checking over portions of this book and conversing with me about the subjects discussed in it. Some of the people listed below have had no direct involvement. Some are no longer alive. But the extent to which they have helped me, through the years, understand Stephen Hawking and his work and the cience related to it, means it would be unconscionable not to thank them here.</p>
<p class="indent">Sidney Coleman, Judith Croasdell, Paul Davies, Bryce DeWitt, Yale Ferguson, Matthew Fremont, Joan Godwin, Andrei Linde, Sue Masey, Don Page, Malcolm Perry, Brian Pippard, Joanna Sanferrare, Leonard Susskind, Neil Turok, Herman and Tina Vetter, John A. Wheeler and Anna Zytkow.</p>
<p class="indent">Nonetheless, any shortcomings in this book are my full responsibility.</p>
