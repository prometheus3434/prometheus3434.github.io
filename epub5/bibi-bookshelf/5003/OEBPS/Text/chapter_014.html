<p class="chaptitle">‘Between film roles I enjoy solving physics problems’</p>
<p class="noindent"><span><span class="small">ANDREI LINDE, WORKING</span></span> with alex vilenkin in the late 1980s and early 1990s, discovered that an inflationary universe has an amazing potential: in chaotic inflation theory, it can ‘self-reproduce’. The result is an enormous fractal arrangement of universes sprouting one out of another. Hawking’s ‘baby universe’ idea also proposed a multitude of other universes. Our own huge universe was suddenly looking small compared with a possible ‘multiverse’.</p>
<p class="h">Inflation Goes ‘Eternal’</p>
<p class="noindent">Imagine again one of those regions in the early universe that is inflating rapidly, while some of its neighbouring regions are not. Within that inflating region, Linde and Vilenkin thought, there would be sub-regions that would expand more rapidly than their parent region, while other <span id="page285">sub-regions</span> would not. Nor is that the end of the story. Sub-regions would beget sub-sub-regions, and so on and so forth. In other words each microscopic region that inflated would in turn be made up of microscopic sub-regions, some of which would inflate and be in turn made up of microscopic sub-sub-regions, and so on and so forth – an eternal inflationary universe scheme. ‘Eternal inflation’ would be a never-ending process of self-reproduction of the universe. As Linde described it, ‘the universe is a huge, growing fractal. It consists of many inflating balls that produce new balls, which in turn produce more balls, ad infinitum.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch14ref1" id="rch14ref1">1</a></sup> The universe we know and can observe is just one of these regions, or sub-regions, or sub-sub-regions. Cartoons portrayed Linde as a carnival balloon seller.</p>
<p class="indent">Are there ‘parallel universes’ like ours? Not necessarily, though other universes something like ours can’t be ruled out. Even though the total picture including what is beyond ‘our universe’ may be irregular and hugely complicated, in our universe the situation is smooth and relatively simple. Inflation in other regions or sub-regions might also have produced large smooth universes. The whole thing may, in fact, become divided into infinitely many exponentially large regions. However, when energy levels in those other large regions decrease to levels similar to those in our universe today, they will each have different laws of physics. Eternal inflation will produce an infinite variety of universes. In John Barrow’s words, ‘we find ourselves faced with the likelihood that … we inhabit a single, simple patch of space and time in an elaborate cosmic quilt … of huge diversity and historical complexity, most of which is totally inaccessible to us.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch14ref2" id="rch14ref2">2</a></sup> <span id="page286">And</span> we don’t find our patch as it is because it is the most likely kind of universe. It is not.</p>
<p class="indent">Barrow used the words ‘historical complexity’ advisedly, for if the whole picture is as eternal inflation describes, there is no reason to think that our own universe exists at or near the beginning of the eternal process. It might have originated as a sub-region of a sub-region of a sub-region – who knows how far we are down the line? In this model, our own universe has a beginning, but the big picture, the enormous fractal arrangement, perhaps need not have either a beginning or an end. Not everyone agrees that this picture stretches infinitely far into the past. Alan Guth, the founding father of inflation theory, working with Alex Vilenkin and Arvind Borde, thinks that the huge ‘eternal’ inflation scenario must have a past boundary, a beginning.</p>
<p class="indent">If all this is taking place, shouldn’t we be able to notice it? The answer is no. The inflation happens so rapidly that the regions and sub-regions and sub-sub-regions, etc., become immediately independent of one another. They move apart faster than the speed of light, becoming separate pocket universes.</p>
<p class="indent">In Linde’s words, ‘According to this scenario, we find ourselves inside a four-dimensional domain with our kind of physical laws, not because domains with different dimensionality and with alternate properties are impossible or improbable, but simply because our kind of life cannot exist in other domains.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch14ref3" id="rch14ref3">3</a></sup> Among an infinite variety of universes, it is likely – perhaps inevitable – that one of them, at least, will be the kind where our sort of life can exist. The anthropic principle is alive and well, and not at all the cop-out it once seemed.</p>
<p class="indent" id="page287">If we can’t see eternal inflation happening on our doorstep or anywhere else, is there <em class="calibre1">any</em> observational evidence – or even <em class="calibre1">potentially possible</em> evidence – for eternal inflation? Hawking was going to show that this is not a hopelessly far-out question, though it might have seemed so when eternal inflation first appeared on the scene.</p>
<p class="h">Global celebrity</p>
<p class="noindent">As the last decade of the twentieth century got underway, Hawking kept up the exhausting level of international travel that had begun soon after the surgery that cost him his voice. Plane flights and hectic schedules were possible for him as long as he had indefatigable, intrepid nurses with him. Travel included more than giving lectures, taking part in conferences and being escorted by dignitaries around tourist sites.</p>
<p class="indent">Trips to Japan, in particular, where Hawking went no fewer than seven times in the 1990s, seemed to produce unusual adventures. Joan Godwin, who was with him as a nurse on most of these eastern jaunts, recalls that on one visit Hawking expressed a strong desire to see the northern part of the country. His hosts warned him that this was an area where earthquakes were expected. They suggested a safer destination. Sendai. Sendai is, of course, where the devastating earthquake and tsunami and the subsequent deadly problems with nuclear reactors occurred in 2011, but Joan recalls that they had a delightful visit there. Once the subject of earthquakes had come up, however, Joan did confer with Hawking about what she should do if one occurred. ‘Save yourself,’ he said. ‘Don’t worry about me.’</p>
<p class="indent" id="page288">During another visit to Japan, an incident occurred that, though it represented no danger to Hawking physically, was perhaps a threat to his ego. On the bullet train platform he was surrounded as he often was by cameras and reporters clamouring for statements and pictures. Then, in the blink of an eye, they inexplicably turned their backs and sprinted off. Hawking was alone. Investigation revealed that a famous Sumo wrestler had alighted from a train on a nearby platform. Hawking was <em class="calibre1">not</em> the most important celebrity in the universe.</p>
<p class="indent-bs">Japan was also the setting for a story told by string theorist David Gross at Hawking’s sixtieth-birthday party conference in 2002:</p>
<p class="quote-jy-bs">When you travel with Stephen you get to meet all sorts of people you would never meet otherwise. We didn’t get to meet the Emperor, which I regret, but we did get to meet somebody who I gather in Japan is even more popular and more famous, that is, the Green Tea Master, and we got to meet geisha girls, etc. But the most interesting experience was when Stephen insisted we all go to a karaoke bar. He actually got us to get up there and sing ‘Yellow Submarine’, which, if I were to try to reproduce, you would run screeching from the room. Every time the chorus came up Stephen would pipe in ‘Yellow Submarine’; he probably still has a ‘Yellow Submarine’ button that he can push!<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch14ref4" id="rch14ref4">4</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Staying close to home was much less interesting. It was also no guarantee of safety. On 6 March 1991, the news spread quickly in Cambridge that Stephen Hawking had been knocked over by a taxi the evening before, crossing <span id="page289">Grange</span> Road, where he and Elaine were living in Pinehurst. It had been dark and raining, but the wheelchair had front and rear bicycle lights and should not have been difficult to see. His nurse screamed ‘Look out!’, and the speeding car caught his wheelchair from behind as he was crossing. He was thrown out on to the road, landing with his legs over what remained of the destroyed chair. It would have been a serious accident even for someone in a state of perfect health and fitness. Nevertheless, he was out of hospital back in his office two days later, with a broken arm in a sling and stitched-up cuts on his head. His personal assistant Sue Masey, his graduate assistant, students and friends had spent those two days frantically bringing in a new wheelchair from another part of the country and finding the necessary parts to repair his computer system, making sure his equipment was restored to normal as rapidly as Hawking.</p>
<p class="indent">In 1992, Stephen and Elaine built a large modern house not far from the centre of Cambridge. From there, Hawking took a new route to his office, through an attractive old passage known as Maltings Lane, emerging to skirt a pond and cross a low-lying, wild, green area of grass and trees and small bridges known as Sheep’s Green. Then he crossed the River Cam where a weir separates the upper river from the part that runs through the Backs, and from there it was a straight shoot into Mill Lane and to his ramp at the DAMTP back entrance.</p>
<p class="indent">Anyone familiar with that footpath through Sheep’s Green might expect that the narrow bridges would have presented a problem. They are barely wide enough to allow bicycles to cross, if cyclists are sufficiently skilful to avoid scraping their hands on the wooden railings built at <span id="page290">handle-bar</span> height. Hawking in his wheelchair ‘threaded the needle’ at speed, even in the dark. On one evening, making the trip home late with him, Joan Godwin stumbled off the ragged edge of the path and fell. Hawking, unaware she wasn’t still behind him, blazed merrily ahead. When a kindly gentleman helped Joan up, announcing that he was an orthopaedic surgeon and hoped she wouldn’t require his services, she asked him please to ‘stop that wheelchair’.</p>
<p class="h">The Inflation of Wrinkles</p>
<p class="noindent">In April 1992, George Smoot, an astrophysicist at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory and the University of California at Berkeley, and his colleagues at several other institutions, announced that data coming in from the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) satellite had revealed ‘ripples’ in the CMBR. This was a hugely significant discovery. Those ripples were the first evidence of the elusive variations that astrophysicists and cosmologists had been looking for in vain since the 1960s. These tiny differences in the topography of the universe when it was only an estimated 300,000 years old were evidence of a situation that would have given gravity a fingerhold and allowed matter to attract matter into larger and larger clumps, eventually forming planets, stars, galaxies and clusters of galaxies. The no-boundary proposal stood to gain credibility from Smoot’s discovery. It had predicted both the overall smoothness of the universe and the deviations from that smoothness that COBE had found.</p>
<p class="indent">Hawking recognized that the COBE findings might even be indirect observational evidence of Hawking <span id="page291">radiation</span>. As we have seen, according to inflation theory, long before the era in which the cosmic microwave background radiation originated – in fact, when the universe was far less than one second old – it went through a period of runaway inflation. Hawking pointed out that during that period the universe would have expanded so enormously and so rapidly that light travelling towards us from some faraway objects would <em class="calibre1">never</em> be able to reach us. It would have to travel at greater than the speed of light to do so. Hearing of some light being able to reach us, while other light can never reach us, suggests the event horizon of a black hole. Hawking proposed that there may indeed have been an event horizon in the early universe that was similar to the event horizon of a black hole, separating the region from which light reaches us from the region from which it doesn’t. From that ancient horizon, there would be radiation just as there is from a black hole, and thermal radiation like this has a characteristic pattern of density fluctuations. In the case of the early universe event horizon, these density fluctuations would have expanded with the universe, but then become ‘frozen in’. We would observe them today as a pattern of minuscule variations in temperature – the ‘ripples’ that Smoot found in the cosmic microwave background radiation. Those ‘ripples’ did indeed turn out to have the characteristic pattern of density fluctuations from thermal radiation such as Hawking radiation.</p>
<p class="h">Star of Stage and Screen</p>
<p class="noindent">In the autumn of 1992, opera-lover Stephen Hawking found himself portrayed on the stage of the Metropolitan Opera in New York City, or rather as a figure suspended somewhat <span id="page292">above</span> it. The opera was not Wagner. It was <em class="calibre1">The Voyage</em>, a new work by Philip Glass, who had composed the score for the film <em class="calibre1">A Brief History of Time</em>. The Met commissioned <em class="calibre1">The Voyage</em> to celebrate the 500th anniversary of Columbus’s journey to the new world, but Glass chose not to retell the story of Columbus. Instead he let Columbus symbolize the human longing to explore and discover.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch14ref5" id="rch14ref5">5</a></sup> In the opera’s prologue, a wheelchair-bound figure, clearly meant to suggest Stephen Hawking, floated above the stage, intoning, ‘The voyage lies where the vision lies.’ A sky full of planets appeared as though he had conjured it, and he flew away.</p>
<p class="indent">The following year, Hawking was more personally involved in one short escapade that remains a favourite memory not only for him but for many of the rest of us, travelling – in imagination – far more boldly into space than the real-life sub-orbital flight he still hopes to take. He was not, for a change, conveyed on the wings of theoretical physics.</p>
<p class="indent">It began in the spring of 1993, at a party celebrating the release of the home video version of the film <em class="calibre1">A Brief History of Time</em>.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch14ref6" id="rch14ref6">6</a></sup> Leonard Nimoy, who played the Vulcan Spock on <em class="calibre1">Star Trek</em>, was among the guests and had the honour of introducing Hawking. As <em class="calibre1">People Magazine</em> described it, ‘Vulcan’s most famous son and Earth’s most celebrated cosmologist instantly melded minds’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch14ref7" id="rch14ref7">7</a></sup> – an allusion that any faithful <em class="calibre1">Star Trek</em> viewer would appreciate. When Nimoy learned that Hawking was an avid fan of <em class="calibre1">Star Trek</em> and, like nearly every other fan, longed to be on the show, he contacted the executive producer Nick Berman. Berman lost no time arranging for a three-minute scene to be added at the beginning of one of the regular weekly episodes, titled ‘Descent’.</p>
<p class="indent" id="page293">The scene was the ‘holodeck’ of the Starship <em class="calibre1">Enterprise</em> – a part of the ship that uses holographic technology to turn the fantasies of crew members into ‘reality’. This was the android Data’s fantasy – a poker game with Einstein, Newton and Hawking. Not surprisingly, Hawking was the only one who played himself. He was sent the script well ahead of time and programmed his lines into his voice synthesizer. In the 1990s and for most of the first decade of the twenty-first century, Hawking was still capable of a number of facial expressions, and these he put to good use playing his role. ‘Everyone was astonished at how much mobility his face has. The vitality behind it is very evident,’ commented the episode director Alex Singer; and John Neville, who played Isaac Newton, added, ‘When you get that smile in response to something you’ve said, it’s worth the whole day’s pay, really.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch14ref8" id="rch14ref8">8</a></sup> Brent Spiner, who as Data was the host of this remarkable poker game, summed it up: ‘When Rick Berman and I are in the old folks’ home sitting in rocking chairs, we’re going to be talking about the Hawk.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch14ref9" id="rch14ref9">9</a></sup> Hawking also seemed to be getting his priorities right: ‘Between film roles,’ he commented on the set, ‘I enjoy solving physics problems.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch14ref10" id="rch14ref10">10</a></sup> His one regret was that ‘unfortunately there was a red alert, so I never collected my winnings’ although he had ‘beaten them all’.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch14ref11" id="rch14ref11">11</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">The cameo role on <em class="calibre1">Star Trek</em> brought Hawking back into the public limelight to a degree that almost exceeded the fame won him by <em class="calibre1">A Brief History of Time</em> and was an asset in publicizing his <em class="calibre1">Black Holes and Baby Universes and Other Essays</em>, which came out the same year, 1993. There soon were other appearances in pop culture. The song ‘Keep Talking’ on Pink Floyd’s <em class="calibre1">The Division Bell</em> album featured his computerized voice.</p>
<p class="h" id="page294">Advocate and role model</p>
<p class="noindent">The <em class="calibre1">Star Trek</em> episode also brought him to the attention, far more than his books had, of young people with various forms and degrees of disability. A <em class="calibre1">Time</em> magazine article in September 1993 described him speaking in Seattle for more than an hour to a rapt, ‘completely focused’ audience of teenagers in wheelchairs.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch14ref12" id="rch14ref12">12</a></sup> After the talk, they crowded around him, asking questions most of which had to do with the practicalities of living with disability and political issues pertaining to the disabled, rather than with science or the cosmos. ‘As they wait for Hawking to tap out his answers, they can’t stop grinning. Here’s a famous scientist, a best-selling author, a <em class="calibre1">Star Trek</em> star – and he’s disabled, just like they are.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch14ref13" id="rch14ref13">13</a></sup> The truth of Hawking’s statement that his fame, while being a mixed blessing, ‘enables me to help other disabled people’,<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch14ref14" id="rch14ref14">14</a></sup> was evident.</p>
<p class="indent">He would help in other ways. In the summer of 1995, he lectured to a capacity crowd at London’s Royal Albert Hall, no mean amount of crowd-drawing power for a venue seating 5,000. The proceeds went to an ALS charity. He helped to publicize an exhibit of technological aids for disabled people, called ‘Speak to Me’, at London’s Science Museum. His presence or sponsorship could assure a sellout crowd nearly anywhere in the world. A January 1993 article in <em class="calibre1">Newsweek</em> described the public and media frenzy at lectures in Berkeley, California, where many of the audience showed up more than three hours early to get seats.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch14ref15" id="rch14ref15">15</a></sup> As he rolled to centre stage, photographers jostled one another for good positions and there was a blizzard of flash bulbs. Harnessing that sort of excitement for the good of disabled people was well worth doing.</p>
<p class="indent" id="page295">Over a decade Hawking had become a master manipulator of his public … or was it just an accident that he always seemed to come up with attention-getting statements whenever public and media attention appeared to require a boost. As one of his personal assistants once commented to me, ‘He isn’t stupid, you know.’ Whichever it was, it proved an advantage not only for himself but for advocates for the disabled and for science in general.</p>
<p class="h">A Challenge for the ‘Prime Directive’</p>
<p class="noindent">An uncharacteristically sour pronouncement at the Macworld Expo in Boston in August 1994 made the news all over the world: ‘Maybe it says something about human nature that the only form of life we have created so far is purely destructive. We’ve created life in our own image.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch14ref16" id="rch14ref16">16</a></sup> Hawking was talking about computer viruses.</p>
<p class="indent">Are computer viruses a form of life? Hawking thought they should ‘count as life’ and, with those words, initiated an uproar. In a recent episode of <em class="calibre1">Star Trek</em>, Captain Picard, confronting a super-intelligent virus, had negotiated with it rather than destroy it, to avoid violating the Star Fleet ‘prime directive’ that forbids interfering in the internal development or social order of any alien society. Destruction of the virus, in this case, would have constituted such a violation. Clearly the writers of <em class="calibre1">Star Trek</em> agreed with Hawking. There were plenty of fans of both <em class="calibre1">Star Trek</em> and Hawking ready to join the debate, on one side or the other.</p>
<p class="indent">‘A living being usually has two elements,’ Hawking argued. ‘First, an internal set of instructions that tell it how to sustain and reproduce itself. Second, a mechanism to <span id="page296">carry</span> out the instructions.’ Life as we know it is biological life, and these two elements are the genes and the metabolism. But ‘it is worth emphasizing that there need be nothing biological about them’. A computer virus copies itself as it moves into different computers and infects linked systems. Though it does not have a metabolism in the usual sense, it uses the metabolism of its hosts, like a parasite. ‘Most forms of life, ourselves included, are parasites in that they feed off and depend for their survival on other forms of life.’</p>
<p class="indent">Because in biology it is by no means a settled matter what is life and what is not, biologists asked to comment were unwilling to say that Hawking was wrong. Computer viruses do certainly fit some definitions of life.</p>
<p class="indent">Hawking closed his speech with yet another startling suggestion for what ‘life’ might include. Human life spans are too short for long-distance interstellar and intergalactic travel, even at the speed of light. However, the necessary longevity would not be difficult for mechanical spaceships that could land on distant planets, mine their resources and then produce new spaceships. The voyage could go on for ever. ‘These machines would be a new form of life based on mechanical and electronic components rather than macro molecules [like biological life],’ said Hawking. A bleak prophecy!</p>
<p class="indent">With everything else he was managing to fit into his schedule, Hawking found time in 1993 to co-edit a volume of technical papers on Euclidean quantum gravity with Gary Gibbons.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch14ref17" id="rch14ref17">17</a></sup> Hawking wrote or co-wrote sixteen of the thirty-seven papers himself. That same year he also published a collection of his own papers on black holes and the big bang.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch14ref18" id="rch14ref18">18</a></sup></p>
<p class="h" id="page297">Arrows of Time</p>
<p class="noindent">Another subject Hawking was lecturing on in his public lectures in the early 1990s was far less disturbing than viruses as a form of life. It was something that had intrigued him for many years: ‘arrows of time’. The increase of entropy (disorder) and the human perception of past and future seem to be linked with the expansion of the universe. Why should this be so? As a doctoral student he had considered writing his thesis on this mysterious topic but decided he wanted something ‘more definite and less airy-fairy’. Singularity theorems were ‘a lot easier’.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch14ref19" id="rch14ref19">19</a></sup> However, when he and Jim Hartle were developing their no-boundary proposal, Hawking had recognized that this work had interesting implications for arrows of time. He returned to the subject in a paper he wrote in 1985 and intended to work on it more at CERN that summer when he instead ended up so disastrously in hospital.</p>
<p class="indent">In the early nineties, with an increasing demand for public lectures, Hawking found that this was indeed a topic that interested his non-expert audiences and that he could explain fairly simply and succinctly. It was also a subject that allowed him to show that eminent scientists are capable of changing their minds and admitting mistakes.</p>
<p class="indent">With very few exceptions, the laws of science make no distinction between forward and backward directions of time. The laws are <em class="calibre1">symmetrical</em> with respect to time. You could make a film of most physical interactions and reverse the direction of the film and no one who saw it could say which way it ought to run. Strange, then, that this is not our experience at the level of the everyday <span id="page298">world</span>. We have a well-defined future and past. We nearly always can tell if a film is running backwards. It would be difficult to mistake one direction for another. How this ‘symmetry-breaking’ occurs is still one of the great mysteries, but we do know that in the universe as we experience it, our perception of the passage of time seems to be linked with the fact that, in any closed system, disorder (or entropy) always increases with time. The road from order to disorder is a one-way street. Broken pottery does not pull its scattered pieces together and hop back on to the shelf. Entropy, disorder, never decreases.</p>
<p class="indent">There are three ‘arrows of time’: the ‘thermodynamic arrow’ (the direction in which disorder, or entropy, increases); the ‘psychological’ or ‘subjective’ arrow (the way human beings experience time passing); and the ‘cosmological arrow’ (the direction of time in which the universe is expanding, not contracting). The question that interested Hawking was why these three arrows exist at all, why they are so well defined and why they point in the same direction. Disorder increases, and we experience the passage of time from past to future, while the universe expands. He suspected the answer lay in the no-boundary condition for the universe, with some help from the anthropic principle.</p>
<p class="indent">The thermodynamic arrow (having to do with the increase of disorder or entropy) and the psychological arrow (our everyday perception of time) <em class="calibre1">do</em> point, always, in the same direction. It is common experience that as time moves forward, disorder, or entropy, increases. Hawking admitted that this is a tautology, concluding that ‘entropy increases with time because we define the direction of time to be that in which entropy increases’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch14ref20" id="rch14ref20">20</a></sup> – but he was satisfied that the psychological arrow and <span id="page299">the</span> thermodynamic arrow are essentially the same arrow.</p>
<p class="indent">Why then does it point in the same direction as the cosmological arrow of time, with the expansion of the universe? Must it? Enter the no-boundary proposal. Recall that in the classical theory of general relativity all physical laws break down at the Big Bang singularity. It is impossible to predict whether or not the beginning of time would have been orderly or a situation of complete disorder in which there was no possibility of disorder increasing. However, if Hawking’s and Hartle’s no-boundary proposal is correct, the beginning was ‘a regular, smooth point of spacetime and the universe would have begun its expansion in a very smooth and ordered state’.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch14ref21" id="rch14ref21">21</a></sup> As the universe expanded, the gradual development of all the structure we observe today – galaxy clusters, galaxies, star systems, stars, planets, you and me – represented a continuous, enormous increase in disorder, and this trend continues. Hence, in the universe as we know it, the thermodynamic arrow, the psychological arrow and the cosmological arrow all point in the same direction.</p>
<p class="indent">But consider what might happen if Friedmann’s first model of the universe is correct (<a href="../Text/chapter_006_split_001.html#ch6fig1">see Figure 6.1</a>), the model in which the universe eventually stops expanding and begins to contract. When expansion changes to contraction, the cosmological arrow of time reverses direction. The big question was, would the thermodynamic and psychological arrows of time also reverse direction? Would disorder start to <em class="calibre1">decrease</em>? Hawking thought there were all sorts of interesting possibilities for science fiction writers here, but he also pointed out that it was ‘a bit academic to worry about what would happen when the universe collapses again, as it will not start to <span id="page300">contract</span> for at least another ten thousand million years.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch14ref22" id="rch14ref22">22</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Nevertheless, the no-boundary condition did seem to mean that disorder would decrease in the collapsing universe, and Hawking at first concluded that when the universe stopped expanding and started to collapse, not only the cosmological arrow but <em class="calibre1">all three arrows</em> would reverse direction and all three continue to point in the same direction as one another. Time would be reversed and people would live their lives backwards, ‘youthening’, as the magician Merlin did in T. H. White’s Arthurian novel <em class="calibre1">The Once and Future King</em>. Broken teacups would reassemble.</p>
<p class="indent">Don Page, by then in the physics faculty at Pennsylvania State University, begged to differ. In a paper that eventually appeared in the same issue of <em class="calibre1">Physical Review</em> as Hawking’s arrow of time paper, Page argued that the no-boundary condition did not mean that all three arrows would have to be reversed when the universe was in its contracting phase.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch14ref23" id="rch14ref23">23</a></sup> Raymond LaFlamme, one of Hawking’s students, found a more complicated model, and the three argued and sent calculations back and forth. Page, with more experience of working with Hawking, suggested to LaFlamme that it would be best not to tell Hawking their conclusion but first to lay out all their assumptions in such a way that Stephen would arrive at the same result without their having told him what it was.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch14ref24" id="rch14ref24">24</a></sup> They finally convinced their mentor that he had been wrong. Though the cosmological arrow of time would reverse when the universe stopped expanding and began to contract, the thermodynamic and psychological arrows would not. It was too late to change Hawking’s paper, but he was able to insert a note admitting, ‘I <span id="page301">think</span> that Page may well be right in his suggestion.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch14ref25" id="rch14ref25">25</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">What, then, is the answer to the question, why do we observe the thermodynamic, psychological, and cosmological arrows pointing in the same direction? Because, even though we would not find ourselves ‘youthening’, we could not survive in the universe when it is collapsing, when the cosmological arrow of time has reversed. At that distance in the future, the universe will be in a state of nearly total disorder, all the stars burned out, the protons and neutrons in them decayed into light particles and radiation. There will no longer be a strong thermodynamic arrow of time at all. We couldn’t survive the death of our sun, but even if we could, we also require a strong thermodynamic arrow of time in order to exist. For one thing, human beings have to eat. Food is a relatively ordered form of energy. The heat into which our bodies convert food is more disordered. Hawking had concluded that the psychological and thermodynamic arrows of time are for all intents and purposes the same arrow, and if one fizzles out, so does the other. In the contracting phase of the universe there could be no intelligent life. The answer to the question of why we observe the thermodynamic, psychological and cosmological arrows pointing in the same direction is: because, if things were different, there would be no one around to ask those questions. If that sounds familiar, it is none other than the anthropic principle. As time (in all three senses) passed, Hawking was thinking less and less of the anthropic principle as a cop-out, ‘a negation of all our hopes of understanding the underlying order of the universe’, and increasingly regarding it as a powerful principle indeed.</p>
<p class="h" id="page302">More Conjuring at the Event Horizon</p>
<p class="noindent">Hawking had suspected in 1981 that Leonard Susskind was ‘the only one in the room who fully appreciated the implications of what I had said’, in Werner Erhard’s attic. In the years since then, Susskind had never been able to leave the information paradox problem alone. ‘Just about everything I have thought about since 1980 has in one way or another been a response to [Hawking’s] profoundly insightful question about the fate of information that falls into a black hole. While I firmly believe his answer was wrong, the question and his insistence on a convincing answer have forced us to rethink the foundations of physics.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch14ref26" id="rch14ref26">26</a></sup> In 1993, referring back to work Hawking had done in the 1970s, Susskind came up with a new way of dealing with a contradiction that defied common sense at the event horizon of a black hole.</p>
<p class="indent">It will come as no news to anyone who has read even the most rudimentary book about black holes that if someone (let us call her Miranda) falls into one, the experience for her will be radically different from what it appears to be from the vantage point of someone (let us call him Owen) who is watching from a spaceship at a distance outside the black hole. Einstein showed that if two people are moving rapidly relative to one other, each one sees the other’s clock slow down and sees the other being flattened out in the direction of motion. Also a clock that is in the vicinity of a massive object (and a black hole is a very massive object) will run more slowly compared with one that is not.</p>
<p class="indent">The upshot is that from the vantage point of distant observer Owen, Miranda as she falls towards the black hole seems to be falling more and more slowly with her <span id="page303">body</span> squashed to a thinner and thinner pancake. Finally, when Miranda reaches the event horizon, Owen sees her come to a stop. He never sees her fall through the horizon, in fact, never sees her quite get there. Meanwhile, Miranda’s own experience is that she falls through the event horizon intact. From Owen’s point of view, she is stuck and flattened; from Miranda’s point of view, she is still falling.</p>
<p class="indent">Susskind had set himself to find out how both could be true and pointed out that although he and you and I, who are neither falling in nor watching from a distance, can agree that both scenarios in our example have occurred, and be troubled by the contradiction, none of us is actually on the spot. Suppose instead that you and I are part of the action. This time I will be the observer at a distance. You fall into the black hole. The crux of the matter is that in a real-life playing out of this story, neither I, the observer at a distance, nor you, who fall into the black hole, ever observes or experiences the contradiction. And you who have experienced an uneventful fall through the event horizon are absolutely incapable of going back and comparing notes with me or of sending me a message. If I happen to fall in later (this possibility stumped Susskind for a while), you would still be so far ahead on the way to the singularity that I would never catch up. It would be impossible for either of us, ever, to know about the version of the story that contradicted our own.</p>
<p class="indent">Susskind, and colleagues Lárus Thorlacius and John Uglum, called this principle that neither observer ever sees a violation of the laws of nature ‘horizon complementarity’.</p>
<p class="indent" id="page304">Take a moment to recall what ‘complementarity’ means. It is using two different, perhaps mutually exclusive descriptions in order to gain a better understanding than either description alone provides. Early in the twentieth century it was physicist Niels Bohr’s way of addressing a problem in physics known as wave-particle duality. People experimenting with the way light propagates (the way it travels) found that it acts as though it were waves. The description of it as particles is ruled out. However, when they studied the way light interacts with matter, they found that it acts as though it must be particles. The model that describes it as waves is ruled out. By 1920 it was clear that light could be conceived of either in terms of waves or in terms of particles, but that neither model by itself could explain the experimental data, and this odd situation could not be resolved by saying that light is sometimes particles and sometimes waves, or that light is both particles <em class="calibre1">and</em> waves. The problem applies to matter as well as to radiation. Bohr wrote to Einstein in 1927, concluding that it was possible to live with what looked like a contradiction ‘as long as we don’t allow our intuitive feeling that matter and radiation must be <em class="calibre1">either</em> wave or particle to “lead us into temptation”’.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch14ref27" id="rch14ref27">27</a></sup> The descriptions were incompatible but both necessary, and both correct.</p>
<p class="indent">The same could be said in the case of horizon complementarity. As Susskind summed it up, ‘The paradox of information being at two places at the same time is apparent and yet a careful analysis shows that no real contradictions arise. But there is a weirdness to it,’ he admits.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch14ref28" id="rch14ref28">28</a></sup> Gerard ’t Hooft of Utrecht had in 1993 introduced what he called ‘dimensional reduction’. Susskind rechristened it the ‘holographic principle’.</p>
<p class="indent" id="page305">Go back to thinking about Miranda falling towards the event horizon, as viewed by Owen, the distant observer in the spaceship. From the spaceship, because of time dilation, Miranda appeared to freeze and spread out at the event horizon. Susskind points out that, by the same token, Owen will also see everything else that originally went into the formation of the black hole, and everything that has fallen into it, likewise frozen at the horizon. ‘The black hole consists of an immense junkyard of flattened matter at its horizon,’ says Susskind.</p>
<p class="indent">The ‘holographic principle’, then, is the idea that information is in some sense stored on the boundary of a system instead of inside it. Think of the holographic image on a credit card, where a three-dimensional image is stored on the two-dimensional surface of the card. Susskind elaborated on that idea to compare a black hole with a giant cosmic projector that takes a three-dimensional person and turns her into a two-dimensional surface on the event horizon. The bottom line was that all that information, stretched out on the edge of the black hole, is not destroyed. It is all there. Not lost.</p>
<p class="indent">A very interesting suggestion about how this all happens came from string theory, in which, you will recall, particles do not look like points but rather like tiny loops of vibrating string. The way a loop of string vibrates determines which type of particle it is. First, think of a single string falling into a black hole. You are watching it from a spaceship at a distance. As it approaches the event horizon, its vibration appears to slow down. The string spreads, ending up with whatever information it carries smeared over the entire event horizon. As each string spreads out, it overlaps others, resulting in a dense tangle. <span id="page306">Since</span> everything is made of strings, everything that falls towards a black hole is smeared out like that. The resulting giant tangle of strings covering the surface of the black hole is able to hold the entire enormous amount of information that fell when the black hole formed and afterwards. Here, then, at the horizon, is everything that ‘fell into the black hole’. As far as the observer at a distance is concerned, it didn’t fall into the hole at all. It stopped at the horizon and was later radiated back into space.</p>
<p class="indent">Susskind visited Cambridge in 1994 and looked upon it as a golden opportunity to talk with Hawking and convince him that horizon complementarity could solve the information paradox. Unfortunately Hawking was ill at the time and they were unable to connect. Finally, Hawking attended a lecture that Susskind delivered about black hole complementarity. Susskind remembers the occasion: ‘This was the last chance for a confrontation with Stephen. The lecture room was full to capacity. Stephen arrived just as I was starting and sat in the back. Normally, he sits up front near the blackboard. He was not alone; his nurse and another assistant were in attendance, just in case he needed medical attention. It was obvious that he was having trouble, and about half way through the seminar, he left. That was it.’<sup class="calibre3"><a href="../Text/references.html#ch14ref29" id="rch14ref29">29</a></sup> Susskind’s ideas would wait until early in the twenty-first century for someone to give them a rigorous mathematical treatment.</p>
