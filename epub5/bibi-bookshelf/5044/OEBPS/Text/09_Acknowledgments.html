  <p class="chaptitle-pre">Acknowledgments</p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">M</span>y inspiration for building these puzzles and the pieces of the puzzle have come from multiple sources:</p>

  <p class="list-unnumbered-topspace">The inspiration starts and ends with God, always.</p>

  <p class="list-unnumbered">The thousands of scientists whose brilliant work I have devoured and spent many thousands of hours pouring over, astounded at the truths God is revealing through them—many of whom I have mentioned in this book and in my references.</p>

  <p class="list-unnumbered">The dedicated, driven, and sometimes very broken patients and clients I have had the privilege of working with over the years. I see their mindful determination to succeed pull them up, often to beyond levels they thought they were capable of.</p>

  <p class="list-unnumbered">The wise Bible and science teachers I have sat under (and still sit under).</p>

  <p class="list-unnumbered">The wonderful Baker Books publishing team—efficiency, excellence, and speed describe their high-standard approach to completing a project.</p>

  <p class="list-unnumbered">My very special family, whose love and support have always been a scaffold to me.</p>

  <p class="list-unnumbered">My friends: There are so many who have encouraged me and spoken words of wisdom and prophecy over my life, and who contributed to this book in ways they perhaps don’t even realize. Mentioning all of you would fill pages, but you know who you are, and I appreciate and love you all. In fact, it was hard to choose who <span class="italic">not</span> to ask to do endorsements because I wanted all of you in my book.</p>
