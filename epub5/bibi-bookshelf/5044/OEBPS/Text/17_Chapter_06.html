  <p class="chaptitle">Stop Milkshake-Multitasking</p>

  <div class="box">
    <p class="scripture"><span class="bold">Main Scripture:</span> Dear friend, listen well to my words; tune your ears to my voice. Keep my message in plain view at all times. Concentrate! Learn it by heart! Those who discover these words live, really live; body and soul, they’re bursting with health. Keep vigilant watch over your heart; that’s where life starts. Proverbs 4:20–23 Message</p>

    <p class="scripture1"><span class="bold">Linked Science Concept:</span> Multitasking is a persistent myth. Paying deep, focused attention to one task at a time is the correct way.</p>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent2"><span class="dropcap">O</span>ne of the plagues of modern existence is multitasking, which leads to the further plagues of “hurry sickness” and obsessive time management. The truth about multitasking is that it is a persistent myth. What we really do is shift our attention rapidly from task to task, resulting in two bad things: (1) We don’t devote as much focused attention as we should to a specific activity, task, or piece of information, and (2) we sacrifice the quality of our attention. I call this “milkshake-multitasking.”</p>

  <p class="h1"><span class="bold">Multitasking Is a Persistent Myth</span></p>

  <p class="noindent">This poor focusing of attention and lack of quality in our thought lives is the complete opposite of how the brain is designed to function and causes a level of brain damage. Every rapid, incomplete, and poor quality shift of thought is like making a milkshake with your brain cells and neurochemicals. This milkshake-multitasking, which is the truth behind multitasking, creates patterns of flightiness and lack of concentration that are unfortunately often erroneously labeled ADD and ADHD and that are too often unnecessarily medicated, adding fuel to the fire. And it’s a rapid downhill slide from there if we don’t get back to our God-design of deep, intellectual attention.</p>

  <p>What does deep, focused, intellectual attention look like versus milkshake-multitasking? The answer is modeled in Proverbs 4:20–23: “Dear friend, listen well to my words; tune your ears to my voice. Keep my message in plain view at all times. Concentrate! Learn it by heart! Those who discover these words live, really live; body and soul, they’re bursting with health. Keep vigilant watch over your heart; that’s where life starts”(Message). It is very interesting that every cell in the body is connected to the heart, and the brain controls the heart and the mind controls the brain. So whatever we are thinking about affects every cell in our body.</p>

  <p>We saw in the last chapter that we are deeply intellectual beings and are designed to bring all thoughts into captivity—are you surprised? We are made in God’s image, after all. He designed us to think through things one at a time in a focused, quality manner by paying attention, listening intently, keeping our eyes on one thing at a time, and fixing it in our mind.</p>

  <p class="h1"><span class="bold">The 140-Character Tweet</span></p>

  <p class="noindent">This design described above contrasts undeniably with the general pattern of modern life today in which so much attention is paid to tweeting on Twitter, Instagramming, and Facebooking to the point that we forget all about enjoying the moment. We are told by so-called social media experts that information needs to be in bite-size amounts and in a constant stream of new information before the previous information has even been digested.</p>

  <p>This is not stimulation; it is bombardment. We have been reduced to 140 characters and an addiction to looking for the next informational high. Students can’t sit quietly and enjoy reading a book, allowing their imagination to take flight.</p>

  <p>Before sharing some of the researched consequences of this milkshake-multitasking momentum we are in, I want to assure you that I believe social media plays an important role in society, business, and life. When used correctly and in a balanced way, it is a phenomenal communications tool. I am all for progress. Used incorrectly, however, this good thing becomes a bad thing.</p>

  <p class="h1"><span class="bold">It’s All about Balance</span></p>

  <p class="noindent">It is all about balance. Our brain responds with healthy patterns, circuits, and neurochemicals when we think deeply, but not when we skim only the surface of multiple pieces of information. Colossians 3:15 in the Amplified Bible explains peace as “soul harmony” that comes from Christ and that acts as an umpire who helps us think, choose, decide, and settle with finality all questions that arise in our minds. But milkshake-multitasking switches on confusion in our brain, making soul harmony impossible.</p>

  <p>Scientists have found that the amount of time spent milkshake-multitasking among American young people has increased by 120 percent in the last ten years. According to a report in the <span class="italic">Archives of General Psychiatry</span>, simultaneous exposure to electronic media during the teenage years—such as playing a computer game while watching television—appears to be associated with increased depression and anxiety in young adulthood, especially among men.<a href="../Text/29_Notes.html#Ch_6rfoot1" id="Ch_6foot1">[1]</a> Considering that teens are exposed to an average of eight and a half hours of multitasking electronic media per day, we need to change something quickly.<a href="../Text/29_Notes.html#Ch_6rfoot2" id="Ch_6foot2">[2]</a></p>

  <p class="h1"><span class="bold">Social Media Enthusiast or Addict?</span></p>

  <p class="noindent">Another concern this raises is whether you are or your teen is a social media enthusiast or simply a social media addict? This is a very real problem—so much so that researchers from Norway developed a new instrument to measure Facebook addiction called the Bergen Facebook Addiction Scale.<a href="../Text/29_Notes.html#Ch_6rfoot3" id="Ch_6foot3">[3]</a> Social media has become as ubiquitous as television in our everyday lives, and this research shows that multitasking social media can be as addictive as drugs, alcohol, and chemical substance abuse.</p>

  <p>A large number of friends on social media networks may appear impressive, but according to a new report, the more social circles a person is linked to, the more likely the social media will be a source of stress.<a href="../Text/29_Notes.html#Ch_6rfoot4" id="Ch_6foot4">[4]</a> It can also have a detrimental effect on consumer well-being because milkshake-multitasking interferes with clear thinking and decision-making, which lowers self-control and leads to rash, impulsive buying and poor eating decisions. Greater social media use is associated with a higher body mass index, increased binge eating, a lower credit score, and higher levels of credit card debt for consumers with many close friends in their social network—all caused by a lack of self-control.<a href="../Text/29_Notes.html#Ch_6rfoot5" id="Ch_6foot5">[5]</a></p>

  <p class="h1"><span class="bold">We Can Become Shallow</span></p>

  <p class="noindent">Milkshake-multitasking decreases our attention, making us increasingly less able to focus on our thought habits. This opens us up to shallow and weak judgments and decisions and results in passive mindlessness. Deep, intellectual thought, however, results in interactive mindfulness—the “soul harmony” presented in Colossians 3:15 (AMP). This requires engaging passionately with the world. We need to increase our awareness of our thoughts and take the time to understand and reflect on them.</p>

  <p>Let’s take a look at some studies that show the impact of changing from a milkshake-multitasking mindset to a deep, intellectual mindset.</p>

  <p>In 2012 a research group at the University of Washington did an interesting study on the effects of meditation training on multitasking. They found that the subjects of the study had fewer negative emotions, could stay on task longer, had improved concentration, switched between tasks more effectively in a focused and organized way, as opposed to haphazardly dashing back and forth between tasks, and spent their time more efficiently.<a href="../Text/29_Notes.html#Ch_6rfoot6" id="Ch_6foot6">[6]</a> These results excited me because I found similar results in my own research.<a href="../Text/29_Notes.html#Ch_6rfoot7" id="Ch_6foot7">[7]</a></p>

  <p class="h1"><span class="bold">My Research</span></p>

  <p class="noindent">In my documented research with patients who had traumatic brain injury (TBI) and students and adults who had learning and emotional disabilities, I was astounded at the change in their cognitive and emotional function once they started applying a more deeply intellectual thinking pattern. I abandoned all traditional therapy, trained them in a new technique I had developed, and showed them how to apply it to their daily life. The changes were almost immediate: improved focus, concentration, understanding, shifting efficiency, and overall effectiveness in producing quality work. There were even positive emotional changes, specifically in self-motivation and self-esteem. And it didn’t stop there; over time they continued to improve in cognitive and emotional functioning. Once they were set on a healthy thinking path, it continued upward in a cascading fashion.</p>

  <p>In the ensuing past twenty years, I have seen these improvements in thousands of patients and clients. This work is the result of God’s guidance, because when I started down this path, it was the complete opposite of my academic training. I instinctively began with and continue to use Scripture—specifically the drive and focus that is called for in Proverbs—as guidance and motivation for my research on the science of thought. This research produced my Switch On Your Brain 5-Step Learning Process (discussed in part 2), which teaches people to use disciplined, focused attention to develop the kind of thinking pattern that has huge benefits on attention networks and saves us from the enemy of distraction.</p>

  <p>As a communication pathologist in the field of cognitive neuroscience, I saw the benefits of focused thinking and disciplined concentration were and are not just behavioral. Everything you do and say is first a thought in your physical brain. You think, and then you do, which cycles back to the original thought, changing it and the thoughts connected to it in a dynamic interrelationship. If your thinking is off (“toxic” or “pathological,” to be really sciency), then your communication through what you say and do is off, and vice versa. As the Scripture says, “As he thinks in his heart, so is he” (Prov. 23:7).</p>

  <p class="h1"><span class="bold">Scientists See Evidence of the Difference</span></p>

  <p class="noindent">Scientists are seeing the evidence of deep, intellectual thought versus milkshake-multitasking in the brain.<a href="../Text/29_Notes.html#Ch_6rfoot8" id="Ch_6foot8">[8]</a> Deep, intellectual thinking activates the prefrontal cortex (just above your eyebrows) in a positive way, producing increased concentration, less distraction, less switching between tasks, more effective switching between tasks, decreased emotional volatility, and overall increase in job completion.</p>

  <p>Scientists have also found that deep, intellectual thinking improves connections within and between nerve networks, specifically in the front part of the brain and between the front and middle parts of the brain.<a href="../Text/29_Notes.html#Ch_6rfoot9" id="Ch_6foot9">[9]</a> Other researchers found that when an individual pays attention to a stimulus, the neurons in the cerebral cortex that represent this object show increased attention.<a href="../Text/29_Notes.html#Ch_6rfoot10" id="Ch_6foot10">[10]</a> We can also alter these patterns of activity by altering our attention, which remaps the cortex.</p>

  <p class="h1"><span class="bold">Determination Is Key</span></p>

  <p class="noindent">During the 1990s, when many neuroscientists were reporting on the power of attention, I saw the greatest changes in patients who willfully, determinedly, and persistently chose to focus their attention on improving their skills and restoring function. For example, one of my patients had been in a car accident when she was a junior in high school that had left her with extreme brain damage. Her neurologist and other doctors told her parents not to raise their hopes of her being more than “a vegetable.” Even when she got back to a fourth-grade level, the doctors said that was her limit. Fortunately she and her family chose not to pay attention to what they said and instead chose to focus her attention on what she wanted for her life. She was determined not only to correct her disabilities from the traumatic accident but also to catch up with her peer group and finish her senior year with them. Consequently, she built new networks in her mind focused on where she wanted to be and strove to make it happen.</p>

  <p>She talked with me about her goals and vision, and we worked together, taking small steps, working consistently toward achieving them. There were times she wanted to give up, but she always picked herself up and carried on. The benefits were evident: Not only did she catch up with her peer group, but she also went on to complete twelfth grade and further her studies after high school. When we applied the various behavioral and neuropsychological tests after her period of therapy and compared them to her functioning before the accident, she had not only restored her original level but had gone way beyond in her functioning.<a href="../Text/29_Notes.html#Ch_6rfoot11" id="Ch_6foot11">[11]</a></p>

  <p>What I believe happened to this patient is captured in two Scriptures: “Nothing they have imagined they could do would be impossible for them” (Gen. 11:6 AMP), and “Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen” (Heb. 11:1). To think positively about our prospects, we must be able to imagine ourselves in the future. Our brains may have stamps from the past, but they are being rewired by our expectation of the future. Imagining a positive future reduces the pain of the past. Faith motivates us to pursue these goals. Hope leads to expectation, which creates peace, excitement, and health in our minds, thus increasing brain and body health.</p>

  <p class="h1"><span class="bold">Additional Benefits of <span class="italic">Not</span> Milkshake-Multitasking</span></p>

  <p class="noindent">An additional benefit from deep thinking is increased <span class="italic">gyrification</span>, a lovely word that means more folds in the cortex of the brain. These extra folds allow the brain to process information faster, make decisions quicker, and improve memory.<a href="../Text/29_Notes.html#Ch_6rfoot12" id="Ch_6foot12">[12]</a> Researchers specifically found an increase in folds in the insula, which is an amazing structure that integrates thinking, emotions, and self-regulation.<a href="../Text/29_Notes.html#Ch_6rfoot13" id="Ch_6foot13">[13]</a> These studies show once again that the more you apply a pattern of deep, intellectual thought in your brain, the more you will improve the physical structure of your brain. Clearly, then, the parts of the brain involved in attention monitoring, working memory (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), and how well we monitor our own thoughts (insula) and feelings improves dramatically with deep, intellectual thought.<a href="../Text/29_Notes.html#Ch_6rfoot14" id="Ch_6foot14">[14]</a></p>

  <p class="h1"><span class="bold">Conclusion</span></p>

  <p class="noindent">These are just a few of the studies that show us that when we discipline our thoughts, positive, physical brain changes happen. This allows us to become more aligned with God’s way of thinking: “Commit your works to the L<span class="xsmall">ORD</span>, and your <span class="italic">thoughts</span> will be established” (Prov. 16:3, emphasis mine). Then we will switch between tasks correctly; monitor our attention, feelings, and thoughts; and function at a higher level. I just love that every instruction God gives us that we actually follow comes with a bonus physically and mentally. You do what God says and peace, happiness, and intelligence will follow.</p>
