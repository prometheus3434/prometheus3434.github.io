  <p class="noindent2">I see myself as a puzzle builder. And in writing my books, the pieces of the puzzles come together to tell a specific story of hope.</p>

  <p class="center0">This book is dedicated to:</p>

  <p class="noindent1">The ultimate Creator of the puzzles—thank you for honoring me with the task of building a few pieces of the “science of thought” puzzle. I am humbled by this task and will endeavor to bring only you glory through it.</p>

  <p class="noindent1">My ever-loving, magnificent love of my life—Mac, my husband. You never seem to tire of listening to me teach on God and the brain with rapt enthusiasm. My sister once said to me that I wouldn’t be able to do what I do if it wasn’t for you, and this is so true. You are the epitome of loving husbands.</p>

  <p class="noindent1">My four outstanding phenomenal children—Jessica, Dominique, Jeffrey, and Alexandria. When I look at you and listen to you, I know I am experiencing God’s love and hope and joy. He has blessed me with the epitome of loving children as well.</p>
