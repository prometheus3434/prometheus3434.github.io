  <p class="noindent2">“When Dr. Caroline Leaf first appeared on <span class="italic">LIFE Today</span> in 2007, our viewers were captivated by her research on how humans think. Dr. Leaf connects the dots between science and Scripture—explaining how we can indeed be ‘transformed by the renewing of [our] mind.’ If you need a change in your thought life or overall attitude, <span class="italic">Switch On Your Brain</span> will convince you that your brain can be renewed by the power of God’s Spirit and biblical truth.”</p>

  <p class="noindent">“This book is the owner’s manual for how our brains work. Caroline Leaf’s first appearance on TBN’s <span class="italic">Praise the Lord</span> program with Laurie and myself is one of the ‘stuck’ memories in my brain. Science in 2013 is actually catching up with the Bible! She has taught us more and more truth over the years now and is in production on an entire TV series that will air on TBN for years!”</p>

  <p class="noindent">“Caroline Leaf has given us a real jewel, translating modern brain science into language accessible to everyone. She engages, educates, and encourages us to use science and biblical truths to improve our thoughts, relationships, and health. This book is a delight, and I highly recommend it to everyone interested in improving their joy and mental health.”</p>

  <p class="noindent">“I resolved not to let twelve years of abuse destroy my mind and my life; I resolved not to let injustice flourish on this earth and instead to stand up and do something about it; I decided to make something out of my brokenness; I decided <span class="italic">to choose to change my mind</span>. Caroline helped me to understand the science behind what had happened in my brain when I made these choices in my life. She explains how our choices work scientifically, but in a practical way that makes something that is really hard to do much easier and more tangible. This book is so helpful that all the girls who go through our A21 program will be learning how to use these principles to help them renew their minds and give them hope so that they can get back into life . . . and change not only their lives but also their world.”</p>

  <p class="noindent">“Dr. Leaf has spoken at Gateway on many occasions, and we’re so grateful for the impact she’s had on our congregation. We’ve seen firsthand how her unique and groundbreaking message changes lives. She understands that your brain is fearfully and wonderfully made by God. We encourage you to act on the wisdom found in <span class="italic">Switch On Your Brain</span> and begin the incredible journey of thinking God’s way.”</p>

  <p class="noindent">“Dr. Caroline Leaf’s research allows for tangible understanding of the link between the Bible and the brain and shows us how understanding this develops us both emotionally and spiritually. Her teaching is not only life changing but life <span class="italic">saving</span> as it makes the renewing of the mind so real. I am so very grateful for the wisdom contained within these pages. Grow as you read.”</p>

  <p class="noindent">“Neuroplasticity? Genetic research? Electromagnetic flow? Never in a million years did I think I could relate to, much less understand, topics like these. Leave me to my normal right-brained tendencies and I’d run as far and fast as I could at the first mention of them. But that was before I met Dr. Caroline Leaf. Some of the most life-transformative lessons I’ve learned have come from this incredible woman whose brilliance is upstaged only by her integrity and graciousness. Whether sitting in an audience along with twenty thousand other people hanging on to her every word, or just sitting across from her over a couple mugs of hot tea, I’ve heard her share deeply scientific data in a profoundly practical and simple way that every person can understand. Even me. <span class="italic">Switch On Your Brain</span> will show you how to turn on the part of your brain, and your life, that has been turned off for far too long. You’ll emerge a happier, healthier, and more well-rounded human being.”</p>

  <p class="noindent">“Dr. Caroline Leaf masterfully weaves brain science and the Word of God. Not only will <span class="italic">Switch On Your Brain</span> detox your brain, it will awaken your brilliance—so that you can be all that God created you to be and do all he fashioned you to do. Read it and renew your mind.”</p>

  <p class="noindent">“I am neither a scientist nor a specialist in this field, but what I do know is that the fruit and influence of Dr. Caroline Leaf’s ministry is inspiring people to see—from a scientific perspective—the genius of God’s timeless Word and wisdom. Each of us is full of untapped potential when it comes to our ability to think and process our way through life. I pray that Caroline’s years of research and passion in this realm of unfolding science will be a blessing to you as you discover what it is to ‘switch on your brain.’”</p>

  <p class="noindent">“In <span class="italic">Switch On Your Brain</span>, my good friend Dr. Caroline Leaf shows us all how the science of thought is catching up with the Word of God. Featuring the 21-Day Brain Detox Plan, Dr. Leaf shares the brain-boosting secrets that she used successfully with thousands of her patients, teaching you how to literally rewire your brain. If you’re looking to improve your memory, your focus, your concentration, or your very life, it’s time to switch on your brain!”</p>

  <p class="noindent">“Can you imagine the outcome of a collaborative effort between a brain scientist and a faith-filled believer with a deep biblical foundation? Fortunately, we have the benefit of such resources from someone who possesses an aptitude in both realms. Dr. Caroline’s works have provided rare insight into the fascinating inner workings of both the natural and the spiritual. <span class="italic">Switch On Your Brain</span> underscores that the capacity for abundant living we have through Christ is directly linked to choice. Her teaching provides both exploration and exercises to enable ‘the lights to come on,’ helping the reader experience a new level of freedom. Her candid and authentic delivery is refreshing and uplifting. I’m grateful for this gift of hope supported by both biblical and scientific proof!”</p>

  <p class="noindent">“<span class="italic">Switch On Your Brain</span> is such a marvelous revelation of how powerful the brain is. I love this! So many times we think, <span class="italic">Well, this is the way I’ve always been and I can’t change</span>. Not true. No matter how we have thought in the past, we can change our present and future with our thinking. God has told us these things, but Caroline has researched them and proven them scientifically. I believe with all my heart that God wants to soak you in his love and to share the revelation of how to detox your brain from the lies of the enemy and switch it on to the love and truth of God’s Word. Thank you, Caroline, for the years you have spent in study, for your commitment to Jesus, for your humility and wisdom, and for being a wonderful friend.”</p>

  <p class="noindent">“If our teachers and students could really grasp the power that we each have to think differently, as described by Dr. Caroline Leaf, we could see a true change in education. When each individual, whether adult, teen, or child, begins to take personal responsibility for our own mental, physical, and spiritual health, it will change lives!”</p>

  <p class="right">—Angie McDonald, superintendent of Advantage Academy Charter Schools</p>

  <p class="noindent">“In this book Dr. Leaf provides you with the key to detoxifying your brain. She combines her years of expertise in brain research with the Word and wisdom of God to show you that you have the ability to rewire negative thoughts and habits that have led you to live a life of ill health, depression, and defeat. Dr. Leaf includes a 21-Day Brain Detox Plan that will teach you how to get the negativity out of your thinking, allowing you to recalculate your destination from down a negative road to one that leads to a happier, healthier, more productive you. We live or die by the choices we make; but if our brains are toxic from poisonous circumstances, events, and decisions from our past, we cannot make quality choices that will effect positive change until we correct our thinking. I encourage you to take advantage of Dr. Leaf’s combination of the Word, wisdom, and science to learn how to ‘flip the switch,’ enabling you to do, be, and have all that God intended for your life.”</p>

  <p class="noindent">“Our thought life plays a critical role in the outward expression of our being. In <span class="italic">Switch On Your Brain</span> Caroline Leaf describes how advancements in cognitive neuroscience support biblical principles pertaining to a healthy thought life. She describes how a healthy thought life can have beneficial effects on our overall health and physiology. She provides a practical strategy to align our thought life with biblical truth to facilitate being continually transformed by the renewing of our mind (Romans 12:2). Dr. Leaf challenges us to see ourselves the way God sees us, through the perfect and finished work of Jesus Christ.”</p>

  <p class="right">—Brian E. Snell, MD, neurosurgeon</p>

  <p class="noindent">“Dr. Leaf demonstrates to us that these breakthroughs in neuroscience are actually ancient, already referenced in the Bible. Neuroscience is actually confirming God’s Word. Caroline’s gift is her ability to renew our childlike wonder at God’s wisdom and creation; we are truly fearfully and wonderfully made (Psalm 139:14). In the second part of the book Dr. Leaf explains how this knowledge can be applied to our lives in a way that even a child can understand. Drawing from her years in clinical practice, she is able to give us practical steps that can truly transform our lives: spirit, soul, and body. I have seen firsthand how these steps have revolutionized people’s lives in family, church, and educational settings. Indeed, they have transformed my own life.”</p>

  <p class="noindent">“When I first met Caroline Leaf in Rwanda years ago, I knew I had met someone with a message that had to be shared with the world. As I leaned in to listen to her heart, her story, her wisdom, and her research, I felt hope rising within me. This is a book of wisdom, knowledge, and truth for everyone. Dr. Leaf’s research and insights based on biblical truth give every reader practical keys to live a happy, healthy, and fulfilled life starting today.”</p>

  <p class="noindent">“Caroline Leaf is such an amazing person, and her book <span class="italic">Switch On Your Brain</span> is super helpful for everyone because we all need help with our thinking! Dr. Leaf teaches us, in this book, some very essential techniques and insights to help us live a life of peace, health, and happiness. This book will be hugely helpful to you no matter your age or educational background!”</p>

  <p class="right">—Sarah Bowling, pastor; cohost with Marilyn Hickey</p>

  <p class="noindent">“I have had the privilege of working with Dr. Leaf when she taught at The King’s University in Los Angeles. During the courses she taught, her books were reviewed, critically examined, and thereafter uniformly adopted by course attendees, college and seminary students, and myself. As you will learn, her teachings are on the cutting edge of research in neuroscience. I am enthusiastic about the material in her latest book, as its application can radically change lives and enhance our walk with Jesus. I recommend you read this book, study the material, and apply the teachings. It will begin a great journey.”</p>

  <p class="right">—C. Fred Cassity, BSE, JD, professor of practical theology, The King’s University</p>

  <p class="noindent">“This new book by Caroline Leaf is a practical plan that helps you implement a technique that takes just seven minutes per day to rewire your brain and change your life. I can personally attest to the effectiveness of her methods since I have been healed now for over eight years of several incurable conditions, including autoimmune thyroid disease, acid reflux, fibroid tumors of the uterus, panic attacks, depression, and chronic fatigue syndrome. I was healed through the use of intentional thinking—meditating on the truth to combat the lies about myself and my life that had been programmed into my psyche. I’m not the same person because I have started to think differently. The simple and easy-to-implement concepts in this book can truly change your life. I encourage you to start today!”</p>

  <p class="right">—Jennifer Crow, founder of Beautiful Dream Society; author of <span class="italic">Perfect Lies</span></p>

  <p class="noindent">“Dr. Leaf has written a book that has the potential to change the life of each of us! Her research and study of the brain has shown that we do have the ability to change our future by changing how we think. In very practical ways she shows us how to do this. This is such an exciting book and I know will be a huge blessing to everyone who reads it!”</p>
