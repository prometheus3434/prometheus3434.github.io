  <p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">R</span>evisiting what you have written will be a revealing process. This is exciting as well because it is a progressive “moving-forward” step; you revisit where you are and look at how to make change happen.</p>

  <p>After you have gathered awareness and done your focused reflection and writing, you will have stimulated major neuroplastic activity, putting your brain in a highly active and dynamic state for marvelous and positive change. This is the perfect state to be in to rewire.</p>

  <p>This step is all about you wiring in what changes you want. You get to design your new healthy thought to replace the toxic thought you want to get rid of. It’s all about redesigning, reorganizing, and re-creating the specific thought you are working on.</p>

  <p class="h1"><span class="bold">Thoughts Become Plastic Enough to Be Redesigned</span></p>

  <p class="noindent">Earlier I explained that when thoughts are activated and pushed into the conscious mind, they enter a labile state—meaning they can be altered. When a memory is in this plastic state, it can be modified, toned down, or retranscribed and reconceptualized by interfering with protein synthesis—an important molecular process in thought building. This is where you do some serious brain surgery (see chap. 3).</p>

  <p class="image"><img alt="image" src="../Images/page_188_2.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="topspace">This is exciting, because once the thought is in the conscious mind after the gather, focused reflection, and writing you can redesign the thought and change it or keep it the same but make it stronger. You choose. Obviously, if you are doing the 21-Day Brain Detox Plan, you have chosen to change the negative, toxic thoughts.</p>

  <p>God builds into the science of thought this amazing ability to renew our minds, which in turn rewires the brain. This means that each time a thought dominates your conscious mind, you can do something with it. You are not a victim of your biology; you can control your reactions to events and circumstances. You can choose to keep your thinking the same or change it. Either way, protein synthesis happens. The toxic memory will either be changed or be strengthened. This process is the major role of the revisit stage.</p>

  <p class="h1"><span class="bold">How to Redesign Thoughts</span></p>

  <p class="noindent">In the revisit, you evaluate what you have written down and work out what the healthy new thought you want to build is going to be. You work out the way forward, a little at a time. Remember, you have twenty-one days to do this, so don’t try to do it all in one day. Visualize what you want the end result to be, but get there in 21 days.</p>

  <p>Not only do you have the opportunity to examine your thoughts on paper, but you have the opportunity to rethink through your reaction to the information—evaluating how toxic the thought is and then retranscribing it to be a healthy and strong part of your memory library.</p>

  <p>By consciously becoming aware of your thought life you are retranscribing and changing your underlying neuronal networks. You need to uncover the toxic thoughts that create such powerful internal conflicts in your mind and that are capable of causing such radical electrochemical imbalances that, when taken to the extreme, cause parts of yourself to be cut off from the rest of you. While gather, focused reflection, and writing are hugely instrumental in this retranscribing and rewiring process, revisiting is a self-reflective process (see chap. 5) that has the purpose of getting free from the internal conflicts with positive planning of the way out. It is a constructive step that takes you through the problem, and it is cumulative. This means you need to think deeply and apply all the keys, which takes twenty-one days for the kind of depth in thinking that results in change. So you don’t have to solve everything on day one—in fact, that would not be wise.</p>

  <p>In revisiting, you are not only looking at how you go about dealing with your circumstances, but you are also thinking through your reactions again, evaluating the toxicity levels, and retranscribing them. This is a positive, looking-for-the-solution step. It feels safe because you are working out the way forward.</p>

  <p>This is where the Bible is so perfect as a guide, because it lays out all the correct management principles for toxicity. At this revisit stage, if you discover you are a worrier, the Scripture in Matthew 6:25, which instructs us to not worry about tomorrow, is a good verse for you to apply.</p>

  <p>So, if you line up your revisit with the principles outlined in God’s Word instead of worldly psychology, you have a foolproof method for doing the right thing.</p>
