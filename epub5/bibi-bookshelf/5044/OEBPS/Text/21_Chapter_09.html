  <p class="chaptitle">What Is the 21-Day Brain Detox Plan?</p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he hardest part about achieving peak happiness, thinking, and health is remembering that we can choose them. Achieving them is not accomplished by putting on a brave or happy face, nor are they attained by adopting an ostrich mentality and pretending that problems don’t exist or that everything will always be great. The way to find this state is by harnessing the neuroplasticity God has designed in our brains and choosing to rewire—or renew—our mind (Rom. 12:2). This is a lifestyle that will bring us ever closer in alignment to our original design of perfection (Matt. 5:48), of being made in God’s image (Gen. 1:26).</p>

  <p>We can actively choose happiness rather than letting our external and internal world of wired-in and learned thoughts and our biology define happiness for us. We need to wire in positive thought networks that can fill us with the power to get us back on track (2 Tim. 1:7). It is the implanted Word that will save our souls (James 1:21). Who we are is where happiness lies, but this is so often blocked by who we have become.</p>

  <p class="h1"><span class="bold">A Simple Tool That Brings Peace</span></p>

  <p class="noindent">Even though the 21-Day Brain Detox Plan is based on rigorous science and the Word of God, it is a simple tool to help bring peak happiness, thinking, health, and peace—not only into your life but also into the lives of your loved ones. To detox your thought life, you need to remember <span class="italic">it’s your thinking that will actually change your brain</span>. So you need to do <span class="italic">consciously</span> what your brain does on a <span class="italic">nonconscious</span> level to build a thought. You control your brain; your brain does not control you.</p>

  <p class="h1"><span class="bold">A Simple Brain Sequence That Makes Things Happen</span></p>

  <p class="noindent">In order to make this nonconscious to conscious process happen effectively, what you do each day is my 5-Step Switch On Your Brain Learning Process. This is a “brain sequence” based on my Geodesic Information Processing Theory, which describes the science of thought (see chap. 8). This is a statistically significant and scientifically proven technique that I developed many years ago and have continued to develop and use over the years in my research and clinical experience to help people think and learn for lasting success. It is based on complex science that focuses on the dynamics of the thought process. In this book I will teach you the simple application, but more thorough details can be found in my scientific references if you wish to read further.<a href="../Text/29_Notes.html#Ch_9rfoot1" id="Ch_9foot1">[1]</a></p>

  <p class="h1"><span class="bold">The 5-Step Switch On Your Brain Learning Process</span></p>

  <p class="noindent">The 5-Step Switch On Your Brain Learning Process has at its heart focused, organized, and disciplined deep intellectual thinking to break down toxic thoughts and build up healthy thoughts—and in doing so, change your brain in a positive direction. This will result in peak thinking, happiness, and health. When applied daily within the correct time frames, it becomes a lifestyle of thinking that renews your mind, creates real change and freedom, and brings you ever closer to God.</p>

  <p>I am always excited to share this theory and process with people because of the joy it brings to see the positive change it makes in the lives of those who truly apply it.</p>

  <p>I demonstrated in my research in the early 1990s that the nonconscious metacognitive mind is much more powerful than the conscious cognitive mind. When you engage the nonconscious mind through deep thinking, you bring memories into the conscious mind in a vulnerable state, which means you can change them—or reconceptualize them. I also found that when the memories go back into the nonconscious mind, they are more complex. You have not simply added information, you have redesigned the memories—and this can go in a positive or negative direction. Scientifically, this is called “creative reconceptualization.”<a href="../Text/29_Notes.html#Ch_9rfoot2" id="Ch_9foot2">[2]</a></p>

  <p>As an individual, you <span class="italic">are</span> capable of making mental and emotional changes in your life. Through your thinking, you can actively re-create thoughts and, therefore, knowledge in your mind.</p>

  <p class="h1"><span class="bold">God Is Revealing More Each Day</span></p>

  <p class="noindent">These research results have been reconfirmed recently, specifically related to post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) trauma. Karim Nader, a professor at McGill University, has done groundbreaking research on memory that scientifically proves that we can renew our minds—more evidence of science catching up with the Bible. He shows that the emotional component of memories can be reconsolidated or changed when recalled into the conscious mind because they become vulnerable. So as a memory moves from the nonconscious mind to the conscious mind, it becomes vulnerable and susceptible to change.<a href="../Text/29_Notes.html#Ch_9rfoot3" id="Ch_9foot3">[3]</a> This is precisely what I proposed and found in my research.</p>

  <p class="h1"><span class="bold">My Documented Results</span></p>

  <p class="noindent">Some of my documented results using this deep-thinking, brain-engaging process were very exciting. My patients with closed-head injuries showed between 110 to 140 percent increase in their academic results. This academic increase started within approximately twenty-one days of starting my 5-Step Switch On Your Brain Learning Process. Furthermore, not only did it improve academic function, but intellectual, emotional, and social skills showed dramatic change as well. One patient in particular showed a better intellectual status, as evaluated on neuropsychological testing, after the accident than before. This means she increased her intelligence, according to the neuropsychologist, by up to 20 points post-accident when normally intellectual scores decrease by 20 to 30 points after a traumatic brain injury.</p>

  <p>Her memory improvement was almost immediate and continued to improve dramatically over the twelve months of therapy. This improvement continued over time with her going on to further her studies and successfully moving into the work arena. Clinically, this patient became more organized and less confused, and she was perceived by her peers as being no different from them.</p>

  <p>This is a major feat because statistical estimates suggest that only one third of patients who suffer traumatic brain injury might return to their previous lifestyle and gainful employment with traditional therapy. In contrast, the 5-Step Switch On Your Brain Learning Process, my nontraditional therapeutic approach, works on metacognitive and cognitive mind issues (see chap. 8), and the improvement in the metacognitive and cognitive mind issues carries over into intellect, emotions, and psychosocial functioning. Probably the most impactful is that the improvement carries over into everyday life and is therefore self-sustaining.</p>

  <p class="h1"><span class="bold">We Can All Get Control of Our Minds</span></p>

  <p class="noindent">At the same time I was working with traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients, I also worked with students with learning problems as well as students who had no learning problems as such, but who wanted to improve their academic progress. My work also included adults pursuing further education and those in corporate life. In my doctoral research, I showed that significant changes in cognitive, academic, and psychosocial function happened in teachers and students alike when they applied my deep-thinking brain technique. Across the board, I was seeing these same kinds of results. I trained thousands of teachers and therapists in my 5-Step Switch On Your Brain Learning Process, and they have, in turn, reached thousands of students and report great changes.</p>

  <p class="h2"><span class="bolditalic">Put Your Mind to It</span></p>

  <p>I even saw this happening in the most challenging of situations back in my home country of South Africa. For many years I worked with starving children who had literally not eaten for many days. In most cases they didn’t have two loving parents at home because at least one if not both had either died of AIDS or had been murdered, and they lived in squalid conditions with more than a 70 percent chance of having been exposed to some form of physical, sexual, or mental abuse—yet they could not get enough of learning how to learn when I ran Switch On Your Brain courses in their schools.</p>

  <p>Even though I was working through the medium of academics in these schools, the sessions became like church services when those brave children recognized that they could use their minds to rise above their circumstances, and that they could change their life with this incredible mind and brain God had given them. They saw learning as an exciting opportunity and wanted to be at school, despite the fact that there were often a hundred hungry, dirty, traumatized children squeezed into a classroom where we would have only one textbook to work from and one old-fashioned chalkboard. They were desperate to learn and sat for hours listening raptly and hardly moving, as though trying to absorb everything I was teaching into every fiber of their being. It was a privilege to be there with those magnificent minds dressed in rags, and this was where I learned some of my greatest lessons about the power of choice and deep, intellectual thought to change the mind.</p>

  <p class="h2"><span class="bolditalic">It’s Not a Heavy Burden</span></p>

  <p>Some researchers who visited Soweto, South Africa, where I worked for years, have compared these amazing children in Soweto to Harvard students, though you could not have two more different worlds.<a href="../Text/29_Notes.html#Ch_9rfoot4" id="Ch_9foot4">[4]</a> Their results showed that 95 percent of the Soweto children said they loved schoolwork and learning; in comparison, about 80 percent (4 out of 5) of the Harvard students suffered from depression so debilitating they could not function.<a href="../Text/29_Notes.html#Ch_9rfoot5" id="Ch_9foot5">[5]</a> This is shocking considering that Harvard has some of the brightest minds, magnificent facilities, and is mentioned often as the gold standard of education.</p>

  <p>When you see choosing to change your mind and to learn as a heavy burden, you miss out on the opportunities in front of you. When you see choosing to change your mind and to learn as a wonderful privilege, suddenly you see the opportunities.</p>

  <p>What I saw in the people I have worked with over the years, some of whom are described in the studies in earlier chapters and above, was a mindset that chose to change and excel. They chose not to allow their difficult life experience to block them. They <span class="italic">chose to change</span>. They chose not to succumb to the pressure nor to get stuck in a neutral position and settle for the status quo.</p>

  <p>Do you want to choose to change? Choosing life is the mindset that brings renewal and revival. This is what I hope my 21-Day Brain Detox Plan will help you achieve.</p>
