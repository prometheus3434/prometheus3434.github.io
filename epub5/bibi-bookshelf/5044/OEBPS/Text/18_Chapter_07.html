  <p class="chaptitle">Thinking, God, and the Quantum Physics Brain</p>

  <div class="box">
    <p class="scripture"><span class="bold">Main Scripture:</span> Today I have given you the choice between life and death, between blessings and curses. Now I call on heaven and earth to witness the choice you make. Oh, that you would choose life, so that you and your descendants might live! Deuteronomy 30:19 NLT</p>

    <p class="scripture1"><span class="bold">Linked Science Concepts:</span> The process of thinking and choosing is the most powerful thing in the universe after God, and it is a phenomenal gift from God to be treasured and used properly. The basic ingredients of quantum physics are: paying attention, thinking and choosing, and consequence.</p>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent2"><span class="dropcap">A</span>s we have explored in previous chapters, our mind activity—the thoughts driven by the power of feelings—are the designers of the landscape of our brains. Thinking and choosing play a central role in who God has made us to be. In linking thought, choice, and science, quantum theory comes up as a star player.</p>

  <p>The process of thinking and choosing is the most powerful thing in the universe after God, and it is a phenomenal gift from God to be treasured and used properly.</p>

  <p class="h1"><span class="bold">Three Different Worlds</span></p>

  <p class="noindent">There is the sensory world of our five senses; there is the world of electromagnetism and the atom; and then there is the subatomic quantum world. This quantum world challenged physicists’ perception of linear time, orderly space, and fixed realities and turned on its head the Cartesian Newtonian world that sees humans as machines with exchangeable parts.</p>

  <p>This is God’s style: Just when humans think they are super smart and know it all, a whole lot of new information enters into the equation and changes everything. In the words of Max Planck, the German theoretical physicist who won the Nobel Prize in 1918 for originating quantum theory, “Science progresses funeral by funeral.”<a href="../Text/29_Notes.html#Ch_7rfoot1" id="Ch_7foot1">[1]</a></p>

  <p class="h1"><span class="bold">Quantum Physics Is Another Way of Admiring God</span></p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Quantum physics</span> is a way of explaining how the things that make up atoms work and makes sense of how the smallest things in nature work. <span class="italic">Quantum</span> means “energy,” and quantum physics tells us how electromagnetic waves—like light waves—and particles work. <span class="italic">Quantum mechanics</span> is the mathematical framework used to describe this energy and how it works.</p>

  <p>Using quantum physics, scientists can describe, predict, and quantify how we choose among a myriad of options. This is a way of <span class="italic">measuring</span> free will or describing it using a mathematical formula. In essence, quantum physics says that</p>

  <ul>
    <li class="list-unnumbered-topspace">your consciousness affects the behaviors of subatomic particles;</li>

    <li class="list-unnumbered">particles move backward and forward in time and appear in all possible places at once; and</li>

    <li class="list-unnumbered">the universe is connected with transfers of information that are faster than light.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="h1"><span class="bold">Quantum Physics Aligning with Scripture</span></p>

  <p class="noindent">Quantum theory converts science’s conception of humans from being mere cogs in a gigantic, mechanical machine to being freethinking agents whose conscious choices affect the physical world.<a href="../Text/29_Notes.html#Ch_7rfoot2" id="Ch_7foot2">[2]</a> This is called the <span class="italic">observer effect</span>: The observer determines the direction in which the possibilities may collapse. In the quantum universe, as we—the observers—affect phenomena, space, and time, we turn possibilities into realities. Mind changes matter.</p>

  <p>Here is a simple way of understanding this observer effect. Each day as you go through the events and circumstances of life, you are faced with a multitude of possibilities to choose, from what to wear in the morning to how you are going to react to the email you have just received. There is an endless array of possible choices you can make at any one moment in time, but it is you, with your ability to think, who directs the choice. So you collapse all the probabilities into one choice: “eggs for breakfast,” “I will not be upset by the tone of this email,” or “I will not say <span class="italic">can’t</span> today.” So as you choose, you collapse the probability into an actuality. Satan, the father of lies (John 8:44), will come at you with a thousand negative probabilities, but you always need to remember that a probability has no power. It only becomes powerful when you believe the lie and collapse the probability into an actuality. This is how evil is birthed.</p>

  <p class="h1"><span class="bold">Free Will—A Basic Ingredient of Quantum Physics</span></p>

  <p class="noindent">Quantum physics has as its basic ingredients free will, directed attention as the result of a choice, and the effects and consequences of these choices. For example, Proverbs 4:20–27 says that if we direct our attention to the Word of God, we will align our thinking and subsequent choices with God, and the outcome will be healing and health.</p>

  <p>Thus an intentional act—such as choosing to attend to God’s words, listen to them, memorize them—will produce the effect of health to all your flesh. Deuteronomy 30:19 (NIV) can be evaluated in the same way: “I have set before you life and death, blessings and curses”—the options—“Now choose life”—you intentionally evaluate the options and choose your reaction—“so that you and your children may live”—which is the consequence of your intentional choice.</p>

  <p>Let’s apply the basic ingredients of quantum physics: paying attention, thinking and choosing, and consequence.</p>

  <ol>
    <li class="list-numbered-topspace">Information: You get a call from your doctor’s office telling you that the results of your blood test are in and asking you to phone them as soon as possible.</li>

    <li class="list-numbered">Thoughts: Multiple thoughts are swirling around in your head. Option one is fear: “They said as soon as possible! Does this mean bad news? What if I have . . .” And on it goes, down to planning the songs for your funeral. Option two is denial: “This is routine; I’ll call when I have time.” Option three is trust: “I have faith that this will be good news. I am not moved by any doctor’s report.”</li>

    <li class="list-numbered">Choice: You choose an option. For instance, if you choose fear, your brain responds by wiring in the thought, “I am sick,” and you live into this thought.</li>

    <li class="list-numbered">Consequence: You suddenly feel sick and are sure you are dying.</li>

    <li class="list-numbered">New consequence: You phone the doctor; your results are clear; and suddenly you feel fine (and perhaps a little foolish).</li>
  </ol>

  <p class="topspace">So your brain becomes what you focused on (body carries out the will of the spirit and soul), and what your brain has become produces what you say and do and how you feel physically and mentally.<a href="../Text/29_Notes.html#Ch_7rfoot3" id="Ch_7foot3">[3]</a></p>

  <p class="h1"><span class="bold">The Granddaddy of Definitions</span></p>

  <p class="noindent">Quantum physics has multiple definitions, but the original Copenhagen formulation of quantum theory made by Niehls Bohr of Copenhagen University in 1927 is considered the <span class="italic">granddaddy</span> of the definitions.<a href="../Text/29_Notes.html#Ch_7rfoot4" id="Ch_7foot4">[4]</a> It states that the free choices made by human subjects are a subjectively controllable variable, which simply means that you control your choices. Quantum mechanics can be used to prove that thinking and choosing are real and measurable.<a href="../Text/29_Notes.html#Ch_7rfoot5" id="Ch_7foot5">[5]</a> The way you experience your feelings, the way you interface with your thoughts, and the kind of attention you give them will change how your brain functions.</p>

  <p>If you apply this principle, you can free yourself from destructive thoughts and actions and change bad habits for good.</p>

  <p class="h1"><span class="bold">The Quantum Zeno Effect</span></p>

  <p class="noindent">I love quantum physics, but the quantum physics principle that really caught my attention is called the Quantum Zeno Effect (QZE). QZE is the repeated effort that causes learning to take place. When you go over and over something, reading it, thinking about it, writing it down, and then repeating this process, you deepen your knowledge and understanding, direct your attention, and grow nerve cells. The neurons in your brain line up and fire together because you are firing synapses over and over, which causes genetic expression to happen and makes the synapses and proteins stronger. The changes in your brain caused by this deep, repeated, intellectually targeted focus can be seen with brain imaging techniques.<a href="../Text/29_Notes.html#Ch_7rfoot6" id="Ch_7foot6">[6]</a></p>

  <p>Basically, the QZE stipulates that your brain becomes <span class="italic">what</span> you focus on and <span class="italic">how</span> you focus. So the consequence is structural change in the brain that produces behavior because we operate from what we have built into our brain. Choosing to pay selective attention to and focus on what you are gathering in through your five senses acts on the physical structure of the brain, amplifying activity in particular brain circuits.</p>

  <p>In my research and clinical practice I have trained teachers and students how to direct their attention in a systematic, organized, logical way that followed how the brain builds thought. This incorporated gathering the relevant information, reading it over and over, thinking about it over and over, writing it down, checking through it all again for accuracy, teaching it out loud, and applying it. I call this my 5-Step Switch On Your Brain Learning Process. In my PhD research, my control group was the historical academic trend of the school, which used basic study skills intervention and a traditional teaching and learning approach. Once I introduced my Switch On Your Brain Process to a group of students, their academic trend significantly improved. The results showed a 35 to 70 percent improvement in metacognitive and cognitive performance as measured by academic results in four subjects: English, math, history, and science.<a href="../Text/29_Notes.html#Ch_7rfoot7" id="Ch_7foot7">[7]</a> These students had developed the attitude that persistence and hard work would achieve an end result, and that stretching themselves and challenging their minds is what would make the change. They learned the science behind this in their sessions with me and applied the lessons in their academics—and the results spoke for themselves. This was essentially the Quantum Zeno Effect in action, which I have also seen repeatedly in my other research, the lives of my patients, my children, and even my own life. I have successfully worked with clients as young as three and as old as seventy-eight—a pilot who wanted to change professions and become a CPA.</p>

  <p>Part of what I taught these students in their first session was an understanding that intelligence is continually developing, so they could become as intelligent as they wanted to be, based on how much they used their brains. Part of this session also included a basic introduction into how the brain works when we learn and how to build memory, including the concept of neuroplasticity. An important fact I explained was that they were <span class="italic">in control</span> of the development of their own brains, and that hard work and challenging themselves helped the brain grow more brain cells. Their motivation and enthusiasm for taking responsibility for their own learning was incredible.</p>

  <p>Dr. Carol Dweck, a Stanford University research psychologist, found similar results. She found that students who believed that intelligence can grow had increasing math scores. Those that believed that intelligence was fixed experienced a decrease in their math scores. She then compared a group of students who were trained in basic study skills to another group who were told how their brains grow in response to novelty and challenge. At the end of the semester, those who had the “mini neuroscience” approach had significantly better math grades than the other group.<a href="../Text/29_Notes.html#Ch_7rfoot8" id="Ch_7foot8">[8]</a></p>

  <p class="h1"><span class="bold">The Law of Entanglement</span></p>

  <p class="noindent">The <span class="italic">law of entanglement</span> in quantum physics states that relationship is the defining characteristic of everything in space and time. Because of the pervasive nature of the entanglement of atomic particles, the relationship is independent of distance and requires no physical link. Everything and everyone is linked, and we all affect each other.</p>

  <p>The law of entanglement has a biblical correlation: “So we, being many, are one body in Christ, and individually members one of another” (Rom. 12:5). If you are not doing what God put you on this earth to do—your divine sense of purpose (Eccles. 3:11)—then even though you may not know me, you are still affecting my life. We are all part of God, so this interconnectedness is not surprising. Your intentions, your prayers, and your words toward others will have impact because of this law. We see this in the Scriptures: “The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much” (James 5:16 KJV). In fact, we are so entangled that our intentions alter not only our own DNA molecules, but the DNA molecules of others as well. An ingenuous experiment set up by the HeartMath Foundation determined that genuine positive emotion, as reflected by a measure called “heart rate variability,” directed with intentionality toward someone actually changed the way the double-helix DNA strand coils and uncoils. And this goes for both positive and negative emotions and intentions.<a href="../Text/29_Notes.html#Ch_7rfoot9" id="Ch_7foot9">[9]</a> Other research shows that even thirty seconds a day of direct heartfelt intention will cumulatively alter not only your own destiny, but impact the lives of others in this generation and the next three at least.<a href="../Text/29_Notes.html#Ch_7rfoot10" id="Ch_7foot10">[10]</a></p>

  <p>Look at the story of the woman in Matthew 9:20–22 who bled for twelve years. She was so desperate for her healing that when she heard about the man called Jesus who heals, she started directing her intentions with each bit of information she received, cumulatively building a physical thought in her mind of her healing and believing it in her heart—in effect she was applying Genesis 11:6 and Hebrews 11:1. In this way she developed her faith and aligned herself with the healing power of God, and in doing so she built a root thought (Proverbs 23:7) and acted upon it to receive her healing. She collapsed all the probabilities into one, which said, “I will be healed if I just touch the hem of his garment.” Furthermore, her entanglement with God (Colossians 1:16) was activated by her choice to believe in her heart and confess with her mouth. There was no cognitive dissonance in her that day, meaning she wasn’t thinking one thing and confessing another. Science shows the beauty of what happens when we align with God. Science is a way God shows us that we are part of him, and when we follow his laws we reap the benefit.</p>

  <p>I honestly believe that by applying our intelligence, which can be developed and trained, we can become amazingly good at understanding how to practice the presence of God. I have personally reached a point where science has taken my relationship with God to a whole new level. He has become very real and very personal. Through science, you see how much trouble he has gone to in order to show himself to us in every way possible.</p>

  <p>We are entangled in each other’s lives, and this is reflected in the structure of the brain. We have “mirror neurons” that fire up as we watch someone else laugh or cry or drink a cup of coffee. Giacomo Rizzolatti and his team were the first to discover these mirror neurons in 1995.<a href="../Text/29_Notes.html#Ch_7rfoot11" id="Ch_7foot11">[11]</a> Through these neurons we literally fire up activity in the brain without actually using our five senses through the normal sensory-cognitive cycle. Empathy is the wonderful God-given ability to identify with, and vicariously understand, the internal experiences of another person, making communication more genuine and valuable.<a href="../Text/29_Notes.html#Ch_7rfoot12" id="Ch_7foot12">[12]</a> When we empathize, many different regions of the brain collaborate in addition to the tiny, miraculous mirror neurons. We have been hardwired to experience powerful compassion for others, and this compassion crosses all three worlds: sensory, electromagnetic, and quantum.</p>

  <p class="h1"><span class="bold">Particles Behave in a Bizarre Way, Which Is Another Reason Why Prayer Works</span></p>

  <p class="noindent">Quantum theory calls entanglement “bizarre behavior” for particles—such as two entangled particles behaving as one even when far apart. Physicists call such behavior <span class="italic">nonlocal</span>, which means that it is physically impossible to know the position and the momentum of a particle at the same time. Another way of saying this is that there is no space-time dimension.</p>

  <p>We know God operates outside of the space-time dimension. And we know prayer does too. There are many stories of people praying for each other on different sides of the planet and experiencing the effect of the prayer. In fact, there are many documented studies on the impact of prayer in the world of neuroscience in addition to the millions of testimonies from Christians around the world.</p>

  <p>An innovative experiment was done that showed that we are capable of impacting each other’s minds and brains even when sensory signals (the five senses), electromagnetic signals, mirror neurons, and insula activity have all been removed. This impact only worked with meditators who had built a relationship with each other, not those in the control group who didn’t have a relationship. In the experiment researchers got two people to meditate next to each other in an electronically shielded room, called a “faraday cage.” Then they separated them into two separate faraday cages, and as they continued to meditate, researchers shone light in the eye of one of the meditators. The part of the brain that lit up in that person’s brain also lit up in the other meditator’s brain, even though there was no sensory or electromagnetic connection.<a href="../Text/29_Notes.html#Ch_7rfoot13" id="Ch_7foot13">[13]</a></p>

  <p>Classical physics says this could only work if there were a prior arrangement—something like, “If this happens, then that will happen.” So no space-time dimension seems to violate our sense of cause and effect in space and time. For example, if someone needs heart surgery, then heart surgery is performed and is either successful or not. However, one study showed that those undergoing heart surgery who had spiritual support in the form of prayer and social support showed a mortality rate one seventh of those who did not.<a href="../Text/29_Notes.html#Ch_7rfoot14" id="Ch_7foot14">[14]</a> Other researchers found that those who attended church regularly and had a stronger faith were less likely to die and had better overall health.<a href="../Text/29_Notes.html#Ch_7rfoot15" id="Ch_7foot15">[15]</a> There are over <span class="italic">twelve hundred</span> studies linking intentional prayer and overall health and longevity.<a href="../Text/29_Notes.html#Ch_7rfoot16" id="Ch_7foot16">[16]</a> Meta-analyses in various medical journals have compiled results that show that intentional prayer significantly affects healing.<a href="../Text/29_Notes.html#Ch_7rfoot17" id="Ch_7foot17">[17]</a> Dr. David Levy, a practicing neurosurgeon in California, prays for his patients before he operates on them and has amazing results. The majority of his patients want him to pray because it shows them he cares more about their health and about them as a person than a physician who does not discuss spiritual matters with his or her patients.<a href="../Text/29_Notes.html#Ch_7rfoot18" id="Ch_7foot18">[18]</a></p>

  <p>I love what Dr. Levy says about how he approaches the often life-threatening and frightening brain surgeries that his patients face:</p>

  <p class="block1">I have been in this profession for a good number of years and am intimately familiar with most of the new therapies, medical devices, and drugs hitting the market. Many of them are ingenious, and I use them regularly in my practice. I have consulted for several companies to develop better devices and have travelled the world teaching others to use them. I admire and am grateful for modern medical technology. But though technology can prolong a life or reduce pain, it cannot always make life better. My experiences have convinced me that spirituality is a crucial element to the wellbeing of a person as a whole; moreover if we let him, God can do powerful, supernatural things in our everyday lives. That’s why I began inviting God into my consultations, exams and surgeries. Many would be surprised that a neurosurgeon—a man of science, logic and human progress—would be such a strong believer in God and divine intervention. Yet the experience has been nothing short of phenomenal.<a href="../Text/29_Notes.html#Ch_7rfoot19" id="Ch_7foot19">[19]</a></p>

  <p class="topspace">This experiment highlights how we impact each other through our intentions and prayers. Our prayers impact each other, but so do the negative words we speak over people we are in relationship with. However, we need to remember that “a curse without cause shall not alight” (Prov. 26:2).</p>

  <p class="h1"><span class="bold">Matter Just Keeps Getting Smaller</span></p>

  <p class="noindent">We have gone from molecules to atoms to quarks, leptons, and bosons; and now physicists are proposing an even smaller concept called <span class="italic">preons</span> as minuscule particles that make up quarks. They are also proposing a string theory, which says that the ultimate building blocks of matter are tiny, vibrating strings, which are even smaller than preons. One scientist even describes preons as twisted braids of space-time.<a href="../Text/29_Notes.html#Ch_7rfoot20" id="Ch_7foot20">[20]</a> If preons exist (I think they do), they are unimaginably tiny and would have to fit inside a quark, which is currently the smallest known particle of matter, having a size of zero, and the strings are even smaller.<a href="../Text/29_Notes.html#Ch_7rfoot21" id="Ch_7foot21">[21]</a></p>

  <p class="h1"><span class="bold">Thought Moves Faster Than the Speed of Light</span></p>

  <p class="noindent">Electrons have been observed to jump from one orbit to another without traveling through the intervening space and without time having elapsed.</p>

  <p>Scientists say our thought signals also seem to move faster than the speed of light and in ways that classical physics cannot explain. How else do you explain the effect we have on each other, how someone with a negative attitude impacts how you feel?</p>

  <p>Remember the mirror neurons in the brain that mirror each other’s emotions, facilitating empathy that I spoke about a few paragraphs back? These signals that are passed between us are made up of energy that can be explained—at this time, anyway—in terms of quantum physics.</p>

  <p class="h1"><span class="bold">A Glimpse into the Spiritual World</span></p>

  <p class="noindent">These observations also give us a glimpse of the spiritual side of the world that is beyond time and space. It could explain how, after Jesus’s resurrection, he appeared to two men on the road to Emmaus, then later that evening as soon as they recognized who he was, he suddenly disappeared (Luke 24:31).</p>

  <p>A few verses further on in Luke’s Gospel, Jesus suddenly appeared among the disciples, and they thought he was a ghost (Luke 24:36–46). Later, Philip suddenly disappears after the Ethiopian’s baptism (Acts 8:28–40). These are all mysteries that quantum physics hints at solving, as though God is reeling us in with beautiful and fascinating concepts to try to explain these mysteries.</p>

  <p class="h1"><span class="bold">Unpredictability Is the Norm</span></p>

  <p class="noindent">Unpredictability is the norm and therefore requires faith and “without faith it is impossible to please God” (Heb. 11:6 NIV). We see this concept in the <span class="italic">Heisenberg uncertainty principle</span>, which is a radical departure from classical physics in that it replaces dogmatic certainty with ambiguity.</p>

  <p>For example, humans are seen as observers outside the system<a href="../Text/29_Notes.html#Ch_7rfoot22" id="Ch_7foot22">[22]</a> who exert an effect that is unpredictable. And it is not just humans who are unpredictable. The unpredictability reaches down to the level of electrons and photons of light, which cannot have a definite momentum or position at the same time; particles are neither particles nor waves because they are both. And as for quarks, bosons, and now preons and strings, they are simply all over the place.</p>

  <p class="h1"><span class="bold">Quantum Physics Math Predictions Show Unpredictability</span></p>

  <p class="noindent">You can try to mathematically predict uncertainty. (Sounds strange, doesn’t it?) Quantum physics math prediction is all about mathematically showing this uncertainty, which basically undergirds free will.<a href="../Text/29_Notes.html#Ch_7rfoot23" id="Ch_7foot23">[23]</a> But you will never be 100 percent accurate in predicting exactly what another person is thinking—even someone you know very well.</p>

  <p>This is a God-ordained precept in which it is clear that no human knows another human’s thoughts except that person and God. “For what man knows the things of a man except the spirit of the man which is in him? Even so no one knows the things of God except the Spirit of God” (1 Cor. 2:11).</p>

  <p>The weather tomorrow, what your friend is going to say, what you will be doing at this time a week from today, in fact all aspects of life in the future—these all follow Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle. It gives us two options: faith or fear. I don’t know what you are going to choose, but obviously I hope it will be faith. Why worry about tomorrow? Your heavenly Father knows what you need (Matt. 6:25–33).</p>

  <p class="h1"><span class="bold">It’s All about Trusting That God Is Who He Says He Is</span></p>

  <p class="noindent">Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle is a nightmare for classical physicists and others who try to explain away God and free will. Einstein, who could never reconcile himself to this random aspect of nature, famously pronounced, “<span class="italic">Der Alte wurfelt nicht</span>,” which is translated, “The old man, that is God, does not play dice.” Well, God is not playing dice; he is simply telling us to trust him and stop trying to control everything, which is a full-blown setback for the notion that the future can be accurately forecast. One cannot fathom the intent of God (Ps. 145:3; Eccles. 3:1; Rom. 11:33).</p>

  <p>Einstein simply looked at it from the wrong angle. The correct angle is found in Scripture: “Trust in the L<span class="xsmall">ORD</span> with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge Him, and he will direct your paths” (Prov. 3:5–6), and “Many are the plans in the mind of a man, but it is the purpose of the L<span class="xsmall">ORD</span> that will stand” (Prov. 19:21 ESV).</p>

  <p>American physicist Don Lincoln, a ground-breaking researcher of particle physics at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, captures very succinctly and clearly what I believe God is doing in science:</p>

  <p class="block1">We can move easily through air but not through a wall. The sun transmutes one element to another, bathing our planet in warmth and light. Radio waves have carried man’s voice to earth from the surface of the moon, whereas gamma rays can inflict fatal damage on our DNA. On the face of it, these disparate phenomena have nothing to do with one another, but physicists have uncovered a handful of principles that fuse into a theory of sublime simplicity to explain all this and much more. This theory is called the standard model of particle physics, and it encapsulates the electromagnetic forces that make a wall feel solid, the nuclear forces that govern the sun’s power plant, and the diverse family of light waves that both make modern communications possible and threaten our well-being.<a href="../Text/29_Notes.html#Ch_7rfoot24" id="Ch_7foot24">[24]</a></p>

  <p class="h1"><span class="bold">God’s Plans</span></p>

  <p class="noindent">Quantum physics, and neuroscience for that matter, do not provide ultimate answers; they are simply stepping-stones in the development of our understanding of our Almighty God, another way of admiring God. Just as sound waves across the air or big metal planes flying in the sky or nuclear power were inconceivable before the discovery of atomic structure, so would unveiling a new layer of matter or a new, complex brain circuit or a biochemical pathway or a better understanding of genes reveal phenomena we cannot even begin to imagine. God pulls us along in exciting suspense in this enjoyable discovery of his creation. He is trying to show us that “glory belongs to God, whose power is at work in us. By this power he can do infinitely more than we can ask or imagine” (Eph. 3:20 GW).</p>

  <p>Let me point out the obvious: God created everything, and that includes science and physics, and he has revealed the laws of this material world we live in over the ages to help us understand him. I am not being a materialist; far from it. I believe God is taking us through the material world into the spiritual world to get to know him more deeply. Why, after all, did he put our soul and spirit in a physical body and place us in a physical world?</p>

  <p>Quantum physics is creeping into every field, causing confusion among scientists, dealing a deathblow to the Newtonian dream, all because it points directly back to God, “the old man,” who has ultimate control. I love it when his plans come together.</p>

  <p class="h1"><span class="bold">Chapter 7 Summary</span></p>

  <p class="list-numbered">1. There is the sensory world of our five senses; there is the world of electromagnetism and the atom; and then there is the deeper quantum world.</p>

  <p class="list-numbered">2. This quantum world challenges physicists’ perception of linear time, orderly space, and fixed realities; and it turns on its head the Cartesian Newtonian world that sees humans as machines with exchangeable parts.</p>

  <p class="list-numbered">3. Quantum physics, which is different from classical physics, is a way of explaining how the things that make up atoms work and making sense of how the smallest things in nature work.</p>

  <p class="list-numbered">4. Quantum means <span class="italic">energy</span>, so quantum physics also tells us how electromagnetic waves—like light waves—work.</p>

  <p class="list-numbered">5. Quantum mechanics is the mathematical framework used to describe this energy and how it works.</p>

  <p class="list-numbered">6. Quantum physics basically says</p>

    <p class="list-unnumbered">• The movement of these particles is random.</p>

    <p class="list-unnumbered">• It is physically impossible to know both the position and the momentum of a particle at the same time.</p>

  <p class="list-numbered">8. Quantum theory converts science’s conception of humans from being mere cogs in a gigantic, mechanical machine to being freethinking agents whose conscious, free choices affect the physical world. This is called the <span class="italic">observer effect</span>.</p>

  <p class="list-numbered">9. The Copenhagen interpretation of quantum theory says that the particle is what you measure it to be. This means our perceptions determine the outcome; we perceive the world through the thoughts (memories) we have built into our brains.</p>

  <p class="list-numbered">10. The Quantum Zeno Effect (QZE) is the repeated effort that causes learning to take place.</p>

  <p class="list-numbered">11. The <span class="italic">law of entanglement</span> in quantum physics states that relationship is the defining characteristic of everything in space and time. Because of the pervasive nature of the entanglement of atomic particles, relationship is independent of distance and requires no physical link. Everything and everyone is linked, and we all affect each other.</p>

  <p class="list-numbered">12. Thought signals seem to move faster than the speed of light and in ways that classical physics cannot explain. This means our mind controls matter and is therefore a creative force.</p>

  <p class="list-numbered">13. Humans are seen as observers outside the system who exert an effect that is <span class="italic">unpredictable.</span> And it is not just humans who are unpredictable. The unpredictability reaches down to the level of electrons and photons of light, which cannot have a definite momentum or position at the same time; particles are neither particles nor waves because they are both. And as for quarks, bosons, and now preons and strings—they are simply all over the place.</p>

  <p class="list-numbered">14. The random and unpredictable nature of quantum physics is called the <span class="italic">Heisenberg uncertainty principle</span>. This principle is a way God shows us that we do not control the future. He does.</p>

  <p class="list-numbered">15. Quantum physics math prediction is all about mathematically showing this uncertainty, which basically undergirds free will.</p>

  <p class="list-numbered">16. I believe God is taking us through the material world into the spiritual world to get to know him more deeply, and the quantum concept is part of this journey.</p>
