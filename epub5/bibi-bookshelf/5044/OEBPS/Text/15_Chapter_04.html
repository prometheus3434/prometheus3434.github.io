  <p class="chaptitle">Catch Those Thoughts</p>

  <div class="box">
    <p class="scripture"><span class="bold">Main Scripture:</span> We destroy arguments and every lofty opinion raised against the knowledge of God, and take every thought captive to obey Christ. 2 Corinthians 10:5 ESV</p>

    <p class="scripture1"><span class="bold">Linked Science Concept:</span> When you objectively observe your own thinking with the view to capturing rogue thoughts, you in effect direct your attention to stop the negative impact and rewire healthy new circuits into your brain.</p>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent2"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he ability to quiet your mind, focus your attention on the present issue, capture your thoughts, and dismiss the distractions that come your way is an excellent and powerful ability that God has placed within you. In the busy age we live in, however, we have trained ourselves out of this natural and necessary skill. <span class="italic">Natural</span> because it is wired into the design of the brain, allowing the brain to capture and discipline chaotic rogue thoughts; <span class="italic">necessary</span> because it calms our spirits so we can tune in and listen to God. When we are mindful of catching our thoughts in this way, we change our connection with God from uninvolved and independent to involved and dependent.</p>

  <p>Research dating back to the 1970s shows that capturing our thoughts in a disciplined way rather than letting them chaotically run rampant can bring about impressive changes in how we feel and think. This change is evidenced in cognitive, emotional functioning as well as at the neural level.<a href="../Text/29_Notes.html#Ch_4rfoot1" id="Ch_4foot1">[1]</a> My research shows that controlled focused thinking leads to impressive improvement in cognitive functioning and emotional balance.<a href="../Text/29_Notes.html#Ch_4rfoot2" id="Ch_4foot2">[2]</a></p>

  <p class="h1"><span class="bold">Freeing Yourself from Burdens</span></p>

  <p class="noindent">Getting your thoughts disciplined and under control is one of the first steps in freeing yourself of the burdens of the world and beginning to enjoy life despite the burdens of the world.</p>

  <p>When you objectively observe your own thinking with the view to capturing rogue thoughts, you in effect direct your attention to stop the negative impact and rewire healthy new circuits into your brain. Second Corinthians 10:3–5 is so clear in the instructions on this matter: “For though we live in the world, we do not wage war as the world does. The weapons we fight with are not the weapons of the world. On the contrary, they have divine power to demolish strongholds. We demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God, and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ” (NIV). In Proverbs 4:20–22 the sage advice is to “give attention to my words; incline your ear to my sayings. Do not let them depart from your eyes; keep them in the midst of your heart; for they are life to those who find them, and health to all their flesh.” The primary success of capturing your thoughts will be to focus on God’s way first, not the world’s ways. And science is showing that meditating on the elements of Jesus’s teachings rewires healthy new circuits in the brain.</p>

  <p class="h1"><span class="bold">Science Shows the Benefits of Catching Your Thoughts</span></p>

  <p class="noindent">When you make a conscious decision to focus and direct your attention correctly, you change physical matter—your brain and your body change in a healthy way. Purposefully catching your thoughts can control the brain’s sensory processing, the brain’s rewiring, the neurotransmitters, the genetic expression, and cellular activity in a positive or negative direction. You choose.</p>

  <p>The benefits are even greater than the scientists back in the ’70s and ’80s imagined. My patients who were successful in therapy took their first steps to success when they started focusing their attention and capturing their thoughts—for example “I can’t do this,” “It’s too hard,” “It’s never worked before,” and “I am not smart enough.” The benefits of catching any negative thoughts like these cannot be emphasized enough. Not catching those thoughts will lead to a potential spiral into confusion and varying levels of mental despair.</p>

  <p class="h1"><span class="bold">Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</span></p>

  <p class="noindent">An interesting body of research shows how a certain type of protein, called a “prion protein,” operates a bit like a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde—the story often used as a metaphor of the good man who hides an evil side. When a prion protein folds over itself, it plays a crucial role in neurodegenerative diseases that lead to dreadful syndromes such as the mad cow disease. But scientists have now found that the prion protein abounds in synapses—the contact point where signals are passed from one nerve cell to the next. Prions help create long-term, self-sustaining memories. They are also important in neuroplasticity, which is the change and rewiring that happens in our brain when we think and learn; and finally, they are involved in neurogenesis.<a href="../Text/29_Notes.html#Ch_4rfoot3" id="Ch_4foot3">[3]</a> The point here is that this protein does amazing things in the brain in response to good signals and goes crazy in response to negative signals. A chaotic mind filled with uncaptured rogue thoughts of anxiety, worry, and any and all manner of fear-related emotions sends out the wrong signal.</p>

  <p class="h1"><span class="bold">Another Example of a Vicious Cycle</span></p>

  <p class="noindent">Stress is the key to understanding the association between depression and heart disease. Research shows that 40 to 60 percent of heart disease patients suffer clinical depression and 30 to 50 percent of patients who suffer clinical depression are at risk for heart disease.<a href="../Text/29_Notes.html#Ch_4rfoot4" id="Ch_4foot4">[4]</a></p>

  <p>Not catching and stopping those thoughts leads to negative, toxic thoughts being wired into the brain; this can lead to depressive thoughts, which causes the body to go into stage two of stress. In response, the immune system produces proteins called <span class="italic">cytokines</span>, including one called <span class="italic">Interleukin-6</span>, as a positive, inflammatory response to protect the brain and body against stress. If the stress is not controlled, the depression increases and the person moves into stress stage 3; over time the inflammation also increases and can lead to arteriosclerosis (hardening of the arteries) and cardiovascular disease.</p>

  <p>All this is from not catching those negative, toxic thoughts. And this is just one disease process; there are a multitude of other manifestations of not stopping this cycle. Recent research has shown that teaching strategies to handle and control stress (the body’s reaction to toxic thinking) could make individuals who are vulnerable to schizophrenia and other neuropsychiatric disorders less vulnerable.<a href="../Text/29_Notes.html#Ch_4rfoot5" id="Ch_4foot5">[5]</a></p>

  <p class="h1"><span class="bold">It Only Takes Five to Sixteen Minutes a Day</span></p>

  <p class="noindent">Research has shown that five to sixteen minutes a day of focused, meditative capturing of thoughts shifts frontal brain states that are more likely to engage with the world.<a href="../Text/29_Notes.html#Ch_4rfoot6" id="Ch_4foot6">[6]</a> Research also showed that those same five to sixteen minutes of intense, deep thinking activity increased the chances of a happier outlook on life.</p>

  <p>God has blessed us with powerful and sound minds (2 Tim. 2:17). When we direct our attention by capturing our thoughts, we provide a target for our mental faculties. Then God will give you a project and your balance will be restored. If you don’t let God give you a thinking project, the Enemy will surely step in to try to catch your thoughts and destroy your balance.</p>

  <p>God has designed the frontal lobe of our brains precisely to do this: handle his thought projects. This perspective is highlighted in the Message version of 2 Corinthians 10:5: “We use our powerful God-tools for smashing warped philosophies, tearing down barriers erected against the truth of God, fitting every loose thought and emotion and impulse into the structure of life shaped by Christ. Our tools are ready at hand for clearing the ground of every obstruction and building lives of obedience into maturity.”</p>

  <p class="h1"><span class="bold">Our Normal Is Perfection</span></p>

  <p class="noindent">Because we are made in God’s image (Gen. 1:26) and have the “mind of Christ” (1 Cor. 2:16), our normal state is one of perfection.</p>

  <p>Science now is able to demonstrate that we are “wired for love,” and fear, which incorporates anything toxic, is therefore not our norm. This means our natural fashioned-after-God inclination is one of optimism and good, healthy thinking. We therefore have a God-given freedom to choose right or wrong—but it comes with conditions attached: “I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing; therefore choose life, that both you and your descendants may live” (Deut. 30:19). This is clearly evidenced in the brain—when bad choices are made, or those negative thoughts are not captured, the neural wiring becomes distorted, which results in disruption of normal function.</p>

  <p>God designed humans to observe our own thoughts, catch those that are bad, and get rid of them. The importance of capturing those thoughts cannot be underestimated because research shows that the vast majority of mental and physical illness comes from our thought life rather than the environment and genes.<a href="../Text/29_Notes.html#Ch_4rfoot7" id="Ch_4foot7">[7]</a></p>

  <p>An undisciplined mind is filled with a continuous stream of worries, fears, and distorted perceptions that trigger degenerative processes in the mind and body. We cannot afford not to bring all thoughts into captivity to Christ Jesus (2 Cor. 10:5).</p>
