  <p class="noindent2">Since 1985, <span class="bold">Dr. Caroline Leaf</span>, a communication pathologist and audiologist, has worked in the area of cognitive neuroscience. She has specialized in traumatic brain injury (TBI) and learning disabilities, focusing specifically on the science of thought as it pertains to thinking and learning. She developed The Geodesic Information Processing Theory and did some of the initial research in neuroplasticity back in the 1990s, showing how the mind can change the brain. A large part of her research in recent years has been to link scientific principles with Scripture, showing how science is catching up with the Bible.</p>

  <p>She applied the findings of her research in clinical practice for nearly twenty years and now lectures and preaches around the world on these topics. She is a prolific author of many books, articles, and scientific articles. She has been a featured guest of <span class="italic">Enjoying Everyday Life</span> with Joyce Meyer; <span class="italic">LIFE Today</span> with James and Betty Robison; Marilyn Hickey; Sid Roth; and TBN’s <span class="italic">Doctor to Doctor</span>, among many others. She now hosts her own show on TBN called <span class="italic">Switch On Your Brain</span>.</p>

  <p>Leaf’s passion is to help people see the link between science and Scripture as a tangible way of controlling their thoughts and emotions, so they can learn how to think, learn, and find their sense of purpose in life.</p>

  <p>Caroline and her husband, Mac, live in Dallas, Texas, with their four children.</p>
