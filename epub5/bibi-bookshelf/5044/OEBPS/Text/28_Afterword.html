  <p class="chaptitle-pre">Afterword</p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">A</span>s I sat down to write this, I wondered why it is that certain things stick in your brain. Then I thought, <span class="italic">Why is it that the guy writing an afterword for a book about how the brain works is asking questions about how the brain works? Why don’t I just read the book and get my answers?</span> Caroline certainly answers my enigma in these pages.</p>

  <p>Let me digress. For me, some of the “stuck” memories are events, locations, smells, feelings, visions, and dreams. Some are good; some are not as good. Diesel exhaust is a real bummer of a memory for me; it can almost immediately make me nauseated. (I went to Israel numerous times as a teenager, and traveled the length and breadth of the Holy Land by diesel-belching buses.)When I feel extreme cold, I think of football. (I opened the door of a hotel one time in Detroit for Lions’ great Hall of Famer Barry Sanders.)</p>

  <p>The geometry definition “two lines cut by a transversal so that alternate interior angles are congruent and the lines are parallel” is burnt into my brain. (I was rudely awakened from an awesome daydream and then traumatized by a math teacher summoning me to the blackboard to solve a math equation from another planet in front of my entire class.)</p>

  <p>When Laurie, my wife of almost thirty years now, tilts her head at a certain angle to look up at me, I feel a “slap a ring on that girl’s finger and run down the aisle and get married” kind of LOVE. I am taken back to the fall of 1984, standing in Pastor Don Price’s church embracing her, instantly in love, holding her longer, tighter, and wondering how many people were like, <span class="italic">Um . . . What’s up with the major PDA in church!</span> We were hardly ever apart after that fateful evening and married a few months later.</p>

  <p>When I am introduced to a person named Tom and/or sometimes just hear the name Tom, I want to giggle, seriously! My brain can replay a movie of Laurie looking at but past me, eyes going wide like she was seeing a ghost over my shoulder! (We were at a friend’s home in Los Angeles for a dinner party, and unbeknownst to me two-time Academy award–winning actor Tom Hanks was standing behind me, waiting to say hello to our host, but I was mid-story and rambling on and on, and Laurie was desperately trying to tell me to shut up and turn around with her “Lucy Ricardo” eye gestures! I finally did, and Tom said, “Hi, I’m Tom.” I said, “Yes, I know.”)</p>

  <p>When I see an advertisement for a certain global technology company that manufactures telephone systems, tears can well up in my eyes. I answered a phone call in 1991 to the sounds of sobbing on the other end of the line. (Laurie choked out the news to me that she had miscarried our second child.) I can remember where I was when I heard about President Reagan being shot; the Challenger disaster; September 11, 2001; the birth of my boys, Caylan and Cody, their first steps, birthday cake being smashed into faces, etc.</p>

  <p>Hopefully you are tracking with me here. I pray you are able to conjure up your own random memories, good and not so good, and are asking the same questions I am. Why do these events become us, become the very persona of who we are? Why <span class="italic">those</span> memories? What makes them “stick” in our brains?</p>

  <p>This book is the owner’s manual for how our brain works. Refer to it regularly. Caroline Leaf’s first appearance on TBN’s <span class="italic">Praise The Lord</span> program with Laurie and me is one of the “stuck” memories in my brain too. I remember thinking that I was not listening to a doctor’s opinion regarding how God created our brains but was actually hearing a revelation that was divinely inspired. I vividly recall saying, “Let me repeat what I think you just said. Our thoughts are actually ‘proteins’ forming the way our brains will actually think about matters in the future? So the Scripture that says, ‘as a man thinks, so is he’ actually means that ‘as a man thinks, so is he’? Wow! Science is actually catching up with the Bible!”</p>

  <p>That was Caroline’s first program with us. She has taught us more and more truth over the years, and is now in production on an entire TV series that will air on TBN for years!</p>

  <p>These pages are not information—they are revelation. And Caroline’s revelation will change the way you think.</p>

  <p>Literally!</p>
