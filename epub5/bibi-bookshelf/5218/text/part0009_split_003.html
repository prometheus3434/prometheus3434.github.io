			<p class="quote">“Knowledge is a treasure, but practice is the key to it.” </p>
			<p class="quote-name">Ibn Khaldoun Al Muqaddima (1332–1406) <br class="calibre1"/><em class="calibre6">SCHOLAR AND STATESMAN</em></p>

			<p class="calibre2">Ancient myths and legends say that to bring forth magic a person must first say “the magic words.” Bringing forth magic from gratitude works in the same way, and first you must say the magic words: <em class="calibre3">thank you</em>. I cannot begin to tell you how important the words <em class="calibre3">thank you</em> are for your life. To live in gratitude, to experience the magic in your life, <em class="calibre3">thank you</em> must become the two words you deliberately say and feel more than any other words. They need to become your identity. <em class="calibre3">Thank you</em> is the bridge from where you are now, to the life of your dreams. </p>

			<p class="calibre2">The Magic Formula:</p>

			<ol class="no-italic">
				<li value="1" class="calibre9">Deliberately think and say the magic words, <em class="calibre3">thank you.</em></li>
				<li value="2" class="calibre9">The more you deliberately think and say the magic words, <em class="calibre3">thank you,</em> the more gratitude you feel.</li>
				<li value="3" class="calibre9">The more gratitude you deliberately think and feel, the more abundance you receive.</li>
			</ol>

			<p class="calibre2">Gratitude is a feeling. So the ultimate aim in practicing gratitude is to deliberately <em class="calibre3">feel</em> it as much as you can, because it’s the force of your feeling that accelerates the magic in your life. Newton’s law is one for one – what you give you receive, equally. That means that if you increase your feeling of gratitude, the results in your life will expand to be <em class="calibre3">equal</em> to your feeling! The truer the feeling, the more sincerely grateful you are, the faster your life will change. </p>
			<p class="calibre2">When you discover how little practice it takes, how easy it is to incorporate gratitude into your daily life, and when you see the magical results for yourself, you will never want to return to the life you used to live. </p>
			<p class="calibre2">If you practice gratitude a little, your life will change a little. If you practice gratitude a lot every day, your life will change dramatically and in ways that you can hardly imagine. </p>
