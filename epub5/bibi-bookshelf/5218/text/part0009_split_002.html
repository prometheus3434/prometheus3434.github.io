<h2 class="calibre8" id="calibre_pb_3">Is Your Life Magical?</h2>

			<p class="calibre2">You can tell right now how much you have actually used gratitude in your life. Just take a look at all of the major areas in your life: money, health, happiness, career, home, and relationships. The areas of your life that are abundant and wonderful are where you have used gratitude and are experiencing the magic as a result. Any areas that are not abundant and wonderful are due to a lack of gratitude. </p>
			<p class="calibre2">It’s a simple fact: when you’re not grateful you cannot receive more in return. You’ve stopped the magic from continuing in your life. When you’re not grateful you stop the flow of better health, better relationships, more joy, more money, and the advancement of your job, career, or business. To <em class="calibre3">receive</em> you have to <em class="calibre3">give</em>. It’s the law. Gratitude is <em class="calibre3">giving</em> thanks, and without it you cut yourself off from the magic and from <em class="calibre3">receiving</em> everything you want in life. </p>
			<p class="calibre2">The bottom line of ungratefulness is that when we’re not grateful, we’re <em class="calibre3">taking</em>; we’re taking things in our life for granted. When we take things for granted we are unintentionally taking from ourselves. The law of attraction says that like attracts like, so if we take something for granted, we will be taken from as a result. Remember, “whoever does not have <strong class="calibre7">gratitude</strong>, even what he or she has will be taken from him or her.”</p>
			<p class="calibre2">Most certainly you have been grateful at various times in your life, but to see the magic and cause a radical change to your current circumstances, you have to practice gratitude and make it your new way of life. </p>
