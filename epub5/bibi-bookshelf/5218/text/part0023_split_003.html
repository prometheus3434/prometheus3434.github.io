			<p class="h">Make All Your Wishes Come True</p>

				<li value="1" class="calibre9">Count Your Blessings: Make a list of ten blessings. Write <em class="calibre3">why</em> you’re grateful. Reread your list, and at the end of each blessing say <em class="calibre3">thank you, thank you, thank you,</em> and feel as grateful for that blessing as you can.</li>
				<li value="2" class="calibre9">Sit down at a computer or with a pen and journal, and list your top <strong class="calibre7">ten</strong> desires. Write <em class="calibre3">thank you </em>three times before each one, <em class="calibre3">as though you’ve already received it.</em> For example: <em class="calibre3">Thank you, thank you, thank you for </em><span class="prompt-line">       your desire       </span><em class="calibre3">.</em></li>
				<li value="3" class="calibre9">
					Using your imagination, answer the following questions in your mind, as though you’ve received each of your ten desires:
					<ol class="no-italic1">
						<li value="1" class="calibre9">What emotions did you feel when you received your desire?</li>
						<li value="2" class="calibre9">Who was the first person you told when you received your desire, and how did you tell them?</li>
						<li class="calibre9" value="3">What is the first great thing you did when you received your desire? Include as much detail as you can in your mind.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li value="4" class="calibre9">Finally, reread the sentence listing your desire, and really emphasize the magic words, <em class="calibre3">thank you,</em> so that you feel them as much as you can. </li>
				<li value="5" class="calibre9">If you like, create a Magic Board. Cut out pictures and attach them to your Magic Board, and put it in a place you see often. Title the board with <strong class="calibre7">THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU</strong> in big bold letters across the top.</li>
				<li value="6" class="calibre9">Just before you go to sleep tonight, hold your Magic Rock in one hand, and say the magic words, <em class="calibre3">thank you,</em> for the <em class="calibre3">best</em> thing that happened during the day.</li>
