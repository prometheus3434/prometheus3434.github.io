			<h3 class="description">ONE WORD CHANGES EVERYTHING</h3>

			<p class="calibre2">For more than twenty centuries, words within a sacred text have mystified, confused, and been misunderstood by almost all who read them.  Only a very few people through history have realized that the words are a riddle, and that once you solve the riddle – once you uncover the mystery – a new world will appear before your eyes.</p>
			<p class="calibre2">In <em class="calibre3">The Magic</em>, Rhonda Byrne reveals this life-changing knowledge to the world.  Then, on an incredible 28-day journey, she teaches you how to apply this knowledge in your everyday life. </p>
			<p class="calibre2">No matter who you are, no matter where you are, no matter what your current circumstances, <em class="calibre3">The Magic</em> is going to change your entire life!</p>
