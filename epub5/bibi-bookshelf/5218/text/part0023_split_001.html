<p class="quote">“Imagination is the true magic carpet.” </p>
			<p class="quote-name">Norman Vincent Peale (1898–1993) <br class="calibre1"/><em class="calibre6"> WRITER </em></p>

			<p class="indent">If you have been following the magical practices day by day, you have now built an amazing foundation by practicing gratitude for everything you have received and continue to receive in your life. But today is an exciting day, because you’re going to begin to use gratitude’s magical power for your dreams and desires!</p>
			<p class="calibre2">Hundreds of native cultures through the centuries have traditionally given thanks for what they want <em class="calibre3">before</em> they receive it, creating elaborate ceremonies to put as much energy as they could into giving thanks. The Egyptians have celebrated the flooding of the Nile River since ancient times to ensure the continual flow of water in the river, American Indians and Australian Aborigines perform rain dances, various African tribes perform ceremonies for their food before they hunt for it, and the very nature of prayer in every culture and religion is giving thanks <em class="calibre3">before</em> having received what is desired. </p>
			<p class="calibre2">The law of attraction says that like attracts like, which means you must form in your mind a likeness, or an image, of what you want. Then, to attract your desire to you, you have to feel as though it’s yours, so that how you feel is also <em class="calibre3">like</em> how you would feel when you had what you wanted. The easiest way to do that is to be grateful for what you want – <em class="calibre3">before</em> you’ve received it. If it never occurred to you before to use gratitude to receive what you want, you have now discovered another of its magical powers. The very words in the Holy Scriptures promise exactly that: </p>
			<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“Whoever has <strong class="calibre7"><em class="calibre3">gratitude</em></strong> (now) will be given more (in the future), and he or she will have an abundance.”</em></p>
			<p class="calibre2">Gratitude is something you must have <em class="calibre3">before</em> you can receive, not something that you simply do <em class="calibre3">after </em>something good has happened. Most people are grateful after they receive something good, but to make all your wishes come true and change your entire life by filling it with riches in every area, you must be grateful before <em class="calibre3">and </em>after. </p>
			<p class="calibre2">Through the act of being sincerely grateful for receiving your desire <em class="calibre3">beforehand,</em> you immediately form an image in your mind that you have it, you feel as though you have it, and you’re fulfilling your part. If you continue to hold to that image and feeling, you will magically receive your desire. You won’t know how you’ll receive it, and it is not your job to figure it out. You don’t try to figure out how gravity is going to keep you on the ground when you go for a walk, do you? You trust and know that when you go for a walk the law of gravity will keep you firmly on the ground. Likewise, you must trust and know that when you’re grateful for what you want, what you want will be magically moved to you, because it is the law of the Universe. </p>
