			<p class="calibre41">So what is the force of attraction? The force of attraction is the force of love! Attraction <em class="calibre3">is</em> love. When you feel an attraction to your favorite food, you’re feeling love for that food; without attraction, you wouldn’t feel anything. All food would be the same to you. You wouldn’t know what you love or what you don’t love, because you wouldn’t be attracted to anything. You wouldn’t be attracted to another person, a particular city, house, car, sport, job, music, clothes, or anything, because it’s through the force of attraction that you feel love!</p>

			<p class="calibre41">The law of attraction <em class="calibre3">is</em> the law of love, and it is the all-powerful law that keeps everything in harmony, from countless galaxies to atoms. It is operating in everything and through everything in the universe. And it is the law that is operating in your life.</p>
			<p class="calibre41">In universal terms, the law of attraction says: like attracts like. What that means in simple terms for your life is: what you <em class="calibre3">give</em> out, you <em class="calibre3">receive</em> back. Whatever you give out in life is what you receive back in life. Whatever you give, by the law of attraction, is exactly what you attract back to yourself.</p>

			<p class="quote2">“To every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.”</p>

			</div>

			<p class="inline-image-centered"><img src="../images/00077.jpeg" alt="give and receive graphic" class="calibre52"/></p>

			<p class="calibre41">Every action of <em class="calibre3">giving</em> creates an opposite action of <em class="calibre3">receiving</em> and what you receive is always equal to what you’ve given. Whatever you give out in life, must return to you. It is the physics and the mathematics of the universe.</p>
			<p class="calibre41"><em class="calibre3">Give</em> positivity, you <em class="calibre3">receive</em> back positivity; <em class="calibre3">give</em> negativity, you <em class="calibre3">receive</em> back negativity. Give positivity and you receive back a life full of positive things. Give negativity and you receive back a life filled with negative things. And how do you give positivity or negativity? Through your thoughts and your feelings!</p>
			<p class="calibre41">In any moment, you’re giving either positive thoughts or negative thoughts. You’re giving either positive feelings or negative feelings. And whether they’re positive or negative will determine what you receive back in your life. All the people, circumstances, and events that make up every moment of your life are being attracted back to you through the thoughts and feelings you’re giving out. Life doesn’t just happen to you; you <em class="calibre3">receive</em> everything in your life based on what you’ve <em class="calibre3">given</em>.</p>

			<p class="inline-image-centered"><img src="../images/00078.jpeg" alt="floral graphic" class="calibre53"/></p>

			<p class="quote2">“Give, and it will be given to you . . . for by your standard of measure it will be measured to you in return.”</p>
			<div class="calibre1">
				<p class="quote-name2"><strong class="calibre39">Jesus</strong> (circa 5 BC-circa AD 30)<br class="calibre1"/> <em class="calibre6">FOUNDER OF CHRISTIANITY, IN LUKE 6:38</em></p>

			<p class="calibre41">What you give – you receive. Give help and support to a friend when he’s moving house, and most surely that help and support will return to you with lightning speed. Give anger to a family member who let you down, and that anger will also return to you, clothed in the circumstances of your life.</p>
			<p class="calibre41">You are creating your life with your thoughts and your feelings. Whatever you think and feel creates everything that happens to you and everything you experience in your life. If you think and feel, “I’ve got a difficult and stressful day today,” then you will attract back to you all people, circumstances, and events that will make your day difficult and stressful.</p>
			<p class="calibre41">If you think and feel, “Life is really good to me,” you will attract back to you all people, circumstances, and events that will make life really good for you.</p>
