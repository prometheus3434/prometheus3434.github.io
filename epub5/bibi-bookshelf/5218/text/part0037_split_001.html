<p class="quote">“The appearance of things changes according to the emotions, and thus we see magic and beauty in them, while the magic and beauty are really in ourselves.”</p>
			<p class="quote-name">Kahlil Gibran (1883–1931) <br class="calibre1"/><em class="calibre6"> POET AND ARTIST</em></p>

			<p class="indent">You can spend the rest of your life running around trying to beat the outside world into the shape you want, chasing one problem after another trying to fix them, complaining about situations or other people, and never succeed in living your life to the fullest and realizing all of your dreams. But when you make the magic of gratitude your way of life, everything in the world around you magically changes – just like that. Your world magically changes because <em class="calibre3">you</em> changed, so what you are attracting changed too.</p>
			<p class="calibre2">In the inspirational words of Gandhi and in the lyrics of Michael Jackson’s song, “<em class="calibre3">Man In The Mirror,</em>” which impacted hundreds of millions, one of the most powerful messages of all time was delivered: </p>
			<p class="calibre2">Change the person in the mirror, and your world will change.</p>
			<p class="calibre2">If you have followed the 26 magical practices to this point, you have changed! And even though it is sometimes hard to see the changes in yourself, you will have felt the change in your happiness, and you will have seen the change of improved circumstances in your life, and the magical changes in the world around you. </p>
			<p class="calibre2">You have practiced the magical power of gratitude for your family and friends, for your work, money, and health, for your dreams, and even for the people you come across each day. But the person who deserves your gratitude more than anyone else is you.</p>
			<p class="calibre2">When you are grateful to be the person in the mirror, feelings of dissatisfaction, discontentment, disappointment, or I’m-not-good-enough completely disappear. And with them, every dissatisfying, discontenting, and disappointing circumstance in your life magically disappears too. </p>
			<p class="calibre2">Negative feelings about yourself cause the greatest damage to your life, because they are more powerful than any feelings you have about anything or anyone else. Wherever you go and whatever you do you take those negative feelings with you in every moment, and those feelings taint everything you touch, and they act as a magnet, attracting more dissatisfaction, discontentment, and disappointment with everything you do. </p>
			<p class="calibre2">When you are grateful to be <em class="calibre3">you,</em> you will only attract circumstances that make you feel even better about yourself. You have to be rich with good feelings about yourself to bring the riches of life to you. Gratitude for yourself enriches you!</p>
			<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“Whoever has <strong class="calibre7"><em class="calibre3">gratitude</em></strong> (for themselves) will be given more, and he or she will have an abundance. Whoever does not have <strong class="calibre7"><em class="calibre3">gratitude</em></strong> (for themselves), even what he or she has will be taken from him or her.”</em></p>
			<p class="calibre2">To do the Magic Mirror practice, go to a mirror right now. Look directly at the person in the mirror, and out loud say the magic words, <em class="calibre3">thank you,</em><em class="calibre3"> </em>with all your heart. Mean it more than you ever have before. Say <em class="calibre3">thank you</em> for being you! Say <em class="calibre3">thank you</em> for everything that you are! Say <em class="calibre3">thank you </em>with at least the same amount of feeling you’ve used for everything and everyone else! Be grateful for <em class="calibre3">you</em> just as you are! </p>
			<p class="calibre2">Continue with the Magic Mirror practice by being grateful to that beautiful person in the mirror for the rest of the day today, and say the magic words, <em class="calibre3">thank you,</em><em class="calibre3"> </em>every time you look at yourself in a mirror. If you’re not in a position to say the magic words out loud at any particular time, then you can say them in your mind. And if you’re <em class="calibre3">really</em> brave, you can look in the Magic Mirror and say three things about yourself that you’re grateful for. </p>
			<p class="calibre2">If for any reason in the future you are not being kind to yourself, you will know to give to the one person who deserves your gratitude more than anyone else – the person in the mirror! </p>
			<p class="calibre2">When you’re grateful, you don’t blame yourself when you make a mistake. When you’re grateful, you don’t criticize yourself when you’re not perfect. When you’re grateful for being you, you are happy, and you will become a magnet to happy people, happy situations, and magical circumstances, which will surround you wherever you go and in whatever you do. When you can see the magic in that person in the mirror, your whole world will change! </p>
