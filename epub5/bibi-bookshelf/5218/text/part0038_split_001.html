<p class="quote">“That’s the thing with magic. You’ve got to know it’s still here, all around us, or it just stays invisible for you.” </p>
			<p class="quote-name">Charles de Lint (B. 1951) <br class="calibre1"/><em class="calibre6"> WRITER AND CELTIC FOLK MUSICIAN</em></p>

			<p class="indent">Every day is unique; there is no day like any other day. The good things that happen each day are forever different and forever changing, and so when you Remember The Magic by counting yesterday’s blessings, no matter how many times you do it, it will be different every time. It’s just one of the reasons why Remember The Magic is the most powerful ongoing practice to maintain the magic of gratitude in your life. No matter what your desires are now, or what desires you will have in the future, this magical practice will remain the most powerful practice for your entire life. </p>
			<p class="calibre2">The easiest way to remember the blessings of yesterday is to start by remembering the beginning of the day when you woke up, and go back over the day in your mind, recollecting the major events of the morning, afternoon, and evening, until you reach the time when you went to bed. When you recall yesterday’s blessings it should be effortless; you are just scanning the surface of yesterday, and as you scan, the blessings will bubble to the surface of your mind. </p>
			<p class="calibre2">You can start this magical practice by asking the question: </p>
			<p class="calibre2">What are the good things that happened yesterday?</p>
			<p class="calibre2">Whenever you ask a question, your mind will immediately look for the answer. Did you receive any great news? Did you magically receive or accomplish one of your desires? Did you magically receive unexpected money? Did you feel especially happy? Did you hear from a friend who you haven’t heard from in a long time? Did something go magnificently well for you? Did you receive a great phone call or email? Did you receive a compliment, or did someone express his or her appreciation for you? Did someone help you to solve a problem? Did you help somebody? Did you finish a project or start something new you’re excited about? Did you eat your favorite food, or watch a great movie? Did you receive a gift, resolve a situation, have a stimulating meeting, quality time with someone, a great conversation, or make plans for something you really want to do?</p>
			<p class="calibre2">Remember The Magic and list yesterday’s blessings on a computer, or write them out in a journal. Scan over the surface of yesterday until you feel satisfied that you’ve recalled the blessings of the day. They can be small things or big things, because it’s not about the size of the blessings; it’s about how many blessings you find, and how much gratitude you feel for each one. As you remember and notate each one, simply be grateful and say the magic words for it – <em class="calibre3">thank you.</em></p>
			<p class="calibre2">When you want to do this magical practice after today, you can mix it up, so that some days you write out the blessings and other days you remember the blessings and say them out loud or in your mind. You can make a quick list of the blessings, or you can make a more detailed list saying why you’re grateful for each one.</p>
			<p class="calibre2">There is no set number of blessings to find from yesterday, because every day is different. But I can assure you that every single day of your life is full of blessings, and when you have opened your eyes to see the truth of this, you will have opened your heart to the magic of life, and your life will be abundant and magnificent. </p>
			<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“Whoever has <strong class="calibre7"><em class="calibre3">gratitude</em></strong> will be given more, and he or she will have an abundance. Whoever does not have <strong class="calibre7"><em class="calibre3">gratitude</em></strong>, even what he or she has will be taken from him or her.”</em></p>
			<p class="calibre2">Remember The Magic – it was created for <em class="calibre3">you!</em></p>
