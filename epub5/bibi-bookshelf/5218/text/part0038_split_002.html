				<li value="1" class="calibre9">Count Your Blessings: Make a list of ten blessings. Write <em class="calibre3">why</em> you’re grateful. Reread your list, and at the end of each blessing say <em class="calibre3">thank you, thank you, thank you,</em> and feel as grateful for that blessing as you can. You have written 280 blessings over the course of this book!</li>
				<li value="2" class="calibre9">Remember The Magic by counting the blessings of yesterday, and writing them down. Ask yourself the question: <em class="calibre3">What are the good things that happened yesterday? </em>Scan the surface of yesterday until you feel satisfied that you’ve remembered and written down all the blessings of the day.</li>
				<li value="3" class="calibre9">As you remember each one, simply say the magic words, <em class="calibre3">thank you,</em> for it in your mind. </li>
				<li value="4" class="calibre9">After today you can do this practice as a written list, or out loud or in your mind. You can make a quick list of the things you’re grateful for about yesterday, or make a shorter and more detailed list and say why you’re grateful for them. </li>
				<li value="5" class="calibre9">Just before you go to sleep tonight, hold your Magic Rock in one hand, and say the magic words, <em class="calibre3">thank you,</em> for the <em class="calibre3">best</em> thing that happened during the day.</li>
