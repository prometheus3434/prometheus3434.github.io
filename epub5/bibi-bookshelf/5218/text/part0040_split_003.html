<h2 class="calibre8" id="calibre_pb_4">Gratitude Is the Answer</h2>

			<p class="calibre2">Gratitude is the cure for broken or difficult relationships, for lack of health or money, and for unhappiness. Gratitude eliminates fear, worry, grief, and depression, and brings happiness, clarity, patience, kindness, compassion, understanding, and peace of mind. Gratitude brings solutions to problems, and the opportunities and wherewithal to realize your dreams. </p>
			<p class="calibre2">Gratitude is behind every success, and it opens the door to new ideas and discoveries, as the great scientists Newton and Einstein proved. Imagine if every scientist followed in their footsteps; the world would be propelled into new territories of understanding, growth, and advancement. Current limits would be broken, and life-altering discoveries would be made in technology, physics, medicine, psychology, astronomy, and every scientific field. </p>
			<p class="calibre2">If gratitude became a mandatory subject in schools, we would see a generation of children who would advance our civilization through spectacular accomplishments and discoveries, obliterating disagreements, ending wars, and bringing peace to the world. </p>
			<p class="calibre2">The nations who will lead the world in the future are the ones whose leaders and people are the most grateful. The gratitude of a nation’s people would cause their country to thrive and become rich, would cause illnesses and disease to drastically drop, businesses and production to escalate, and happiness and peace to sweep the nation. Poverty would disappear, and there would not be a single person in hunger, because a grateful nation could never allow it to exist. </p>
			<p class="calibre2">The more people who discover gratitude’s magical power, the faster it will sweep the world, and cause a gratitude revolution.</p>
