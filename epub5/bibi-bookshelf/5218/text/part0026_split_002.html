			<p class="calibre2">Think about the great health you have received throughout your childhood, adolescence, and adult life. Think about the times when you felt full of energy, and you were happy. Recollect three separate times in your mind when you felt on top of the world, say the magic words, <em class="calibre3">thank you,</em><em class="calibre3"> </em>and feel sincere gratitude for those times. If you think back to the big moments in your life, you will be able to recollect three separate times very easily.</p>
