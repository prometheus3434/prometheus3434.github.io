			<h1 class="single-text" id="calibre_pb_0">Acknowledgments</h1>

			<p class="indent">When I first sit down to write a book, the creation begins as a joyful yet solitary one; there is just the Universe and me. Then, gradually, the circle begins to widen, encompassing more and more people, all of whom contribute their expertise, until finally you are holding the creation of a new book in your hands. The following people were a part of the ever-widening circle of creation that allowed <em class="calibre3">The Magic</em> to reach you.</p>
			<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Thank you, thank you, thank you:</em> to my daughter Skye, who worked tirelessly side by side with me editing, along with Josh Gold, who contributed his scientific knowledge and research skills to help me unite the discoveries of science with the words of religion. Thanks to my editor, Cindy Black from Beyond Words, for her straightforward editing approach and probing questions, which have made me a better writer. Thanks to Nic George for his creative vision, which captured the magic through the interior graphics and the front cover. </p>
			<p class="calibre2">To Shamus Hoare and Carla Thornton at Gozer Media, thanks for the final production of the graphics and the layout of the book. Thanks to The Secret team who help me take a new book into the world, and who are the backbone of my work; in particular my sister Jan Child, who heads up the entire publishing team; Andrea Keir, who heads up our colossal creative team; Paul Harrington and my sister Glenda Bell, who teamed up with photographer Raphael Kilpatrick and the rest of our team to create the magical pictures in this book. And thanks to the other Secret team members, whose behind-the-scenes work is invaluable: Don Zyck, Mark O’Connor, Mike Gardiner, Lori Sharapov, Cori Johansing, Chye Lee, Peter Byrne, and my daughter Hayley. </p>
			<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Thank you, thank you, thank you</em> to my publishers, Atria Books and Simon &amp; Schuster: to Carolyn Reidy, Judith Curr, Darlene DeLillo, Twisne Fan, James Pervin, Kimberly Goldstein, and Isolde Sauer. I am blessed to have such an amazing team of people.</p>
			<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Thank you, thank you, thank you</em> to Angel Martin Velayos for his spiritual guidance, love, and wisdom, to my sister Pauline Vernon and my dearest friends and family for their continued support and enthusiasm for my work. And with the deepest gratitude to those great human beings of centuries ago who discovered the truths of life, and who left their written words so that we might discover them at exactly the right time – that indefinable life-changing moment when we have the eyes to see, and the ears to hear.</p>
