<p class="quote">“Reflect upon your present blessings of which every man has plenty; not on your past misfortunes of which all men have some.”</p>
			<p class="quote-name">Charles Dickens (1812–1870) <br class="calibre1"/><em class="calibre6">WRITER</em></p>

			<p class="indent">In the beginning of working with these practices, it takes concentrated days in a row to make gratitude a habit. Anything that reminds you to be grateful is helping you turn your life into gold with gratitude, and that’s exactly what this magical practice is about. </p>
			<p class="calibre2">Lee Brower presented the gratitude rock practice in <em class="calibre3">The Secret</em> film and book, when he told us the story of the father of a dying child who used a gratitude rock to be grateful for his son’s health, and his son made a miraculous recovery. Since then the gratitude rock has been a proven success with many people the world over, who have used it for money, healing, and happiness. </p>
			<p class="calibre2">First, find a rock or a stone. Choose a small size that fits in the palm of your hand and that you can close your fingers around. Choose a rock that is smooth, without sharp edges, not too weighty, and that feels really good in your hand when you hold it. </p>
			<p class="calibre2">You can find a Magic Rock from your garden if you have one, or from a riverbed, creek, ocean, or park. If you don’t have easy access to any of these places, then ask your neighbors, family, or friends. You may even have a precious rock or stone already that you can use as your Magic Rock. </p>
			<p class="calibre2">When you have found your Magic Rock, put it by your bedside, in a place where you will definitely see it when you go to bed. Clear some space if necessary so that you can easily see your Magic Rock when you go to bed. If you use an alarm clock, put it next to your alarm clock.</p>
			<p class="calibre2">Tonight, just before you get into bed to go to sleep, pick up your Magic Rock, hold it in the palm of one hand, and close your fingers around it.</p>
			<p class="calibre2">Think back carefully through all the good things that happened during the day, and find <em class="calibre3">the best thing</em> that happened that you’re grateful for. Then say the magic words, <em class="calibre3">thank you,</em> for the best thing that happened. Return the Magic Rock to its place by your bed. And that’s it! </p>
			<p class="calibre2">Every night for the next 26 days, follow the same Magic Rock practice. Before you go to sleep, think back through the day, and find the <em class="calibre3">best</em> thing that happened that day. While holding your Magic Rock in your hand, be as grateful as you can be for that thing, and say <em class="calibre3">thank you.</em> </p>
			<p class="calibre2">Using a rock seems like such a simple thing to do, but through this practice you will see magical things begin to happen in your life. </p>
			<p class="calibre2">When you look for the <em class="calibre3">best</em> thing that happened during the day, you will search through many good things that happened, and in the process of searching and then deciding on the <em class="calibre3">best</em> one you are actually thinking of many things you’re grateful for. You will also be ensuring that you go to sleep and wake up in gratitude each day.</p>
			<p class="calibre2">The Count Your Blessings and Magic Rock practices will ensure that you begin and end your days in a state of gratitude. In fact, they are so powerful that together they would change your life in a few months. But this book is designed to change your life really fast through an abundance of magical practices. Because gratitude is magnetic and attracts more things to be grateful for, the concentration of gratitude over 28 days will intensify the magnetic force of your gratitude. When you have a strong magnetic force of gratitude, like magic, you automatically magnetize everything you want and need to you! </p>
