			<p class="calibre2">You’re going to choose one thing you want to improve about your body for today’s magical practice, but you are going to use gratitude’s magical power for it in a very particular way. Think about the <em class="calibre3">ideal</em> state of what you want to improve. When you give thanks for the <em class="calibre3">ideal</em> state of anything, you have put into motion to receive back that ideal state. </p>
			<p class="calibre2">Very often when a person is diagnosed with an illness or disease of some kind, they will not only talk about it a lot, but they will research the disease, gathering information about its possible worsening symptoms and dreaded outcomes. In other words, they give their entire focus to the disease. However, the law of attraction says that we can’t make a problem go away by focusing on it, because focusing on the problem can only make the problem worse. Instead, we should do the exact opposite, and focus on the <em class="calibre3">ideal</em> state for the area of our body that is unwell, and give our thoughts and feelings to that. Gratitude for the <em class="calibre3">ideal</em> state of any part of our body powerfully uses our thoughts and feelings together so we magnetize it to us – in one fell swoop!</p>
			<p class="calibre2">Spend one minute in visualizing a scene of yourself with the <em class="calibre3">ideal</em> state of your body that you want. And as you see your body in your mind the way you want it to be, be grateful for it as though you have received it.</p>
			<p class="calibre2">So, if you want to magically restore health to your kidneys, be grateful for strong and healthy kidneys that filter and sift out all the waste products from your body. If you want to magically restore health to your blood, be grateful for pure and healthy blood that flows oxygen and nutrients to all parts of your body. If you want to magically restore health to your heart, give thanks for a strong and healthy heart that maintains the well-being of every organ in your body. </p>
			<p class="calibre2">If you want to magically improve your eyesight, then give thanks for excellent vision. If you want to improve your hearing, then give thanks for perfect hearing. If you want more flexibility, then give thanks for a perfectly supple and agile body. If you want to change your weight, first think about the <em class="calibre3">ideal </em>weight that you want to be, then imagine yourself at that ideal weight, and give thanks for it as though you have received it now. </p>
			<p class="calibre2">Whatever it is that you want to improve, first imagine yourself with the <em class="calibre3">ideal</em> state, and then be grateful for the <em class="calibre3">ideal</em> state as though you have received it right now. </p>

			<p class="quote">“Natural forces within us are the true healers of disease.”</p>
			<p class="quote-name">Hippocrates (circa 460–circa 370 BC) <br class="calibre1"/><em class="calibre6"> FATHER OF WESTERN MEDICINE </em></p>

			<p class="calibre2">You can follow the Magic and Miracles in Health practice every day if you need to, and you can do it multiple times in a day if you really want to accelerate the magical restoration of full health, or the improvement of an aspect of your body. But it is vital that whenever you have a negative thought or feeling about the current state of your body or health that you replace it immediately by visualizing yourself with the <em class="calibre3">ideal</em> state you want and by being truly grateful, as though you have already received it. </p>
			<p class="calibre2">The most effective way to guarantee health, other than taking good care of yourself physically, is to continue to be grateful for your health. </p>
