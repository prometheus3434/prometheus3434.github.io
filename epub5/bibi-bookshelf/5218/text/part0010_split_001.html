<p class="quote">“As we express our gratitude, we must never forget that the highest appreciation is not to utter words, but to live by them.”</p>
			<p class="quote-name">John F. Kennedy (1917–1963) <br class="calibre1"/><em class="calibre6">35TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES</em></p>

			<p class="indent">In this book, there are 28 magical practices that have been specifically designed so that you learn how to use gratitude’s magical power to revolutionize your health, money, job, and relationships, and to make your smallest desires and your biggest dreams come true. You will also learn how to practice gratitude to dissolve problems and transform any negative situation. </p>
			<p class="calibre2">You will be captivated while you read this life-changing knowledge, but without practicing what you learn, the knowledge will slip through your fingers, and the opportunity that you attracted to easily change your life will be gone. To ensure this doesn’t happen to you, you need to practice gratitude over 28 days, so that you impregnate your cells and your subconscious mind with it. Only then will it change your life – permanently.</p>
			<p class="calibre2">The practices are designed to be completed over 28 consecutive days. This allows you to make gratitude a habit and a new way of life. Practicing gratitude in a concentrated effort over consecutive days guarantees that you will see the magic take place in your life – and fast!</p>
			<p class="calibre2">Within each magical practice is a wealth of secret teachings that will expand your knowledge in tremendous ways. In each practice you will understand more and more about how life works, and how easy it is to have the life you’ve dreamed of.</p>
			<p class="calibre2">The first twelve practices use the magical power of gratitude for what you have now and for what you’ve received in the past, because unless you’re grateful for what you have, and what you’ve received, the magic won’t work and you won’t receive more. These first twelve practices will set the magic of gratitude into motion immediately. </p>
			<p class="calibre2">The next ten practices use the magical power of gratitude for your desires, dreams, and everything you want. Through these ten practices you will be able to make your dreams come true, and you will see the circumstances of your life magically change! </p>
			<p class="calibre2">The last six practices take you to a whole new level, where you will be saturating gratitude into every cell of your body and mind. You will learn how to use gratitude’s magical power to help other people, dissolve problems, and improve any negative situation or circumstance you may encounter throughout your life.</p>
			<p class="calibre2">You don’t need to clear your calendar, because each of the practices has been specifically created to fit into your everyday life, whether it’s workdays, weekends, holidays, or vacations. Gratitude is portable – you take it with you wherever <em class="calibre3">you</em> go, and then wherever <em class="calibre3">you </em>go, the magic happens! </p>
			<p class="calibre2">If you miss a day, you will most likely lose the momentum of what you have done. To ensure that you don’t reduce the magic, if you miss a day, count back three days and repeat the practices again from there.</p>
			<p class="calibre2">Some practices are designed for the morning, and others are designed to do throughout the day, so read each day’s practice first thing in the morning. Some practices will need to be read the night before because they begin when you wake, and I will tell you when to do this. You might want to read the next day’s practice every night before you go to sleep, in order to be prepared. If you do, make sure to reread the practice again in the morning. </p>
			<p class="calibre2">If you don’t want to follow the 28 magical practices consecutively, you can also use them in other ways. You could choose one magical practice that addresses an important subject in your life that you want to change or improve, and you could do that practice three days in a row or every day for a week. Or you could do one magical practice a week, or two practices a week, the only difference being that it will take you longer to see the changes in your life. </p>
