			<p class="calibre2">Many of the magical practices are designed to help you achieve your dreams. Therefore, you need to get clear about what you <em class="calibre3">really</em> want.</p>
			<p class="calibre2">Sit down with a computer or pen and paper and make a list of what you really want in every area of your life. Think through every detail of what you want to be, do, or have in your life – in your relationships, career, finances, health, and every area that is important to you. You can be as specific and detailed as you like, but remember your job is simply to list what you want, not how you’re going to get what you want. The “how” will be done <em class="calibre3">for</em> you when gratitude works its magic. </p>
			<p class="calibre2">If you want a better job, or your dream job, then think about everything you want the job to be. Think about the things that are important to you, such as the type of work you want to do, how you want to feel in your job, the type of company you want to work for, the kind of people you want to work with, the hours you want to work, where you want your job to be, and the salary you want to receive. Get very clear about what you want in the job by thinking it through thoroughly and writing all the details down. </p>
			<p class="calibre2">If you want money to educate your children, work out the details of their education, including which school you want your children to attend, the cost of the school fees, books, food, clothing, and transportation, so that you know exactly how much money you will need. </p>
			<p class="calibre2">If you want to travel, then write down the details of the countries you want to visit, how long you want to travel for, what you want to see and do, where you want to stay, and the means by which you want to travel.</p>
			<p class="calibre2">If you want a perfect partner, then write down every detail of the characteristics you want that person to have. If you want improved relationships, write down the relationships you want to improve, and what you want them to be like. </p>
			<p class="calibre2">If you want more health, or an improved bodily condition, be specific about what ways you want to improve your health or body. If you want a dream home, then list every detail of what you want the home to be, room by room. If there are specific material things you want, like a car, clothes, or appliances, write them down. </p>
			<p class="calibre2">If you want to achieve something, such as passing an exam, getting a degree, a goal in sports, succeeding as a musician, doctor, writer, actor, scientist, or businessperson, or whatever it is you would like to achieve, write it down and be as specific as possible.</p>
			<p class="calibre2">I would strongly urge you to find the time to maintain a list of your dreams throughout your life. Write down the little things, the big things, or what you want this moment, this month, or this year. As you think of more things add them to the list, and as you receive things, cross them off the list. An easy way to do a list of what you want is to divide it into categories of: </p>

			<p class="calibre2">Health and body </p>
			<p class="calibre2">Career and work </p>
			<p class="calibre2">Money </p>
			<p class="calibre2">Relationships </p>
			<p class="calibre2">Personal desires </p>
			<p class="calibre2">Material things</p>
			<p class="calibre2">And then just add the things you want to each category. </p>

			<p class="calibre2">When you get clear about the things you want, you are giving a definite direction to the way you want gratitude’s magical power to change your life, and you are ready to begin the most exciting and thrilling adventure you’ve ever been on! </p>
