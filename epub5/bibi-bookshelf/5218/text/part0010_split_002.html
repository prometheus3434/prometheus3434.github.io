<h2 class="calibre8" id="calibre_pb_3">After the 28 Days</h2>

			<p class="calibre2">Once you’ve completed the 28 magical practices, you can use particular practices to increase the magic where or when you have a specific need, such as for health or money, or if you want to receive your dream job, have increased success in your work, or improve a relationship. Or to continue the practice of gratitude you can open this book at random, and whichever practice you open to is the one you attracted, so it’s the perfect one to do that day. </p>
			<p class="calibre2">At the end of the 28 magical practices, there are also recommendations of practices you can use in combination, which will accelerate the magic in specific areas of your life. </p>
			<p class="calibre2">Can you overdo gratitude? Never! Can your life become too magical? Hardly! Use the practices over and over, so that gratitude seeps into your consciousness and becomes second nature to you. After 28 days you will have rewired your brain, and implanted gratitude in your subconscious mind, where it is automatically the first thing that comes to your mind in any situation. The magic you experience will be your inspiration, because as you incorporate gratitude into your days, they will be nothing short of spectacular! </p>
