<p class="quote">“Miracles are not contrary to nature, but only contrary to what we know about nature.” </p>
			<p class="quote-name">Saint Augustine (354–430) <br class="calibre1"/><em class="calibre6"> THEOLOGIAN AND CATHOLIC BISHOP</em></p>

			<p class="indent">We should feel healthy, energized, and full of happiness most of the time, because that is how it feels to have our birthright of full health. The reality, however, is that a lot of people don’t feel this way very often, if ever. Many people are dealing with illnesses, problems with the functioning of their body, or suffering from bouts of depression and other mental health problems, which are all states of less-than-full health.</p>
			<p class="calibre2">Gratitude is one of the fastest ways I know to magically begin experiencing the full state of health you are meant to have in your body and mind. All the miracles of healing we see happen are simply the result of full health being restored instantly in the human body, where before there was less than full and perfect health. If you don’t think gratitude creates miracles in your health and body, then read some of the thousands of miracle stories on The Secret website: www.thesecret.tv/stories. </p>
			<p class="calibre2">Gratitude’s magical power <em class="calibre3">increases</em> the natural flow of health to the mind and body, and can assist the body in healing more quickly, as countless studies have shown. The magical power of gratitude also works hand in hand with good bodily care, nutrition, and any medical assistance you might have chosen to follow.</p>
			<p class="calibre2">When there is some kind of sickness or condition in your body, it is understandable that you may have negative feelings about it, like worry, frustration, or fear. But having negative feelings about sickness does not restore health. In fact, it has the opposite effect – it reduces health even more. To increase your health, you need to replace the negative feelings with good feelings, and gratitude is the easiest way to do it.</p>
			<p class="calibre2">Many people also have critical thoughts and feelings of dissatisfaction about their physical appearance. Unfortunately those thoughts and feelings also reduce the magical flow of health. When there’s something you don’t like about your body, you are not being grateful for your body. Think about it. By the law of attraction, complaints about your body bring more problems to complain about, and so complaining about your body or appearance puts your very health at risk. </p>
			<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“Whoever does not have <strong class="calibre7"><em class="calibre3">gratitude</em></strong> (for their health and their body), even what he or she has will be taken from him or her.”</em></p>
			<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“Whoever has <strong class="calibre7"><em class="calibre3">gratitude</em></strong> (for their health and their body) will be given more, and he or she will have an abundance (of health to their body).”</em></p>
			<p class="calibre2">You may be sick or unwell now, or even in a lot of pain, but if you are reading these words you are continuing to receive the gift of health. It can be very difficult to access feelings of gratitude when sick or in pain, but even the smallest bit of gratitude helps increase the magical flow of health to the body.</p>
			<p class="calibre2">Today’s practice, Magic and Miracles in Health, is designed to dramatically increase your health and happiness. And we’re going to take a triple-pronged approach to accelerate the results.</p>
