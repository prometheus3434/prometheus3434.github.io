			<p class="calibre19">You are the most powerful magnet in the Universe! You contain a magnetic power within you that is more powerful than anything in this world, and this unfathomable magnetic power is emitted through your thoughts.</p>

			<p class="calibre19"><em class="calibre3">Basically put, the law of attraction says that like attracts like. But we’re really talking at a level of thought.</em></p>
			<p class="calibre19">The law of attraction says <em class="calibre3">like attracts like</em>, and so as you think a thought, you are also attracting <em class="calibre3">like</em> thoughts to you. Here are more examples you may have experienced of the law of attraction in your life:</p>
			<p class="calibre19">Have you ever started to think about something you were not happy about, and the more you thought about it the worse it seemed? That’s because as you think one sustained thought, the law of attraction immediately brings more<em class="calibre3"> like </em>thoughts to you. In a matter of minutes, you have gotten so many <em class="calibre3">like</em> unhappy thoughts coming to you that the situation seems to be getting worse. The more you think about it, the more upset you get. </p>
			<p class="calibre19">You may have experienced attracting <em class="calibre3">like</em> thoughts when you listened to a song, and then found that you couldn’t get that song out of your head. The song just kept playing over and over in your mind. When you listened to that song, even though you may not have realized it, you gave your full attention and focus of thought to it. As you did that, you were powerfully attracting more <em class="calibre3">like </em>thoughts of that song, and so the law of attraction moved into action and delivered more thoughts of that song, over and over again. </p>

			<p class="calibre19"><em class="calibre3">Our job as humans is to hold on to the thoughts of what we want, make it absolutely clear in our minds what we want, and from that we start to invoke one of the greatest laws in the Universe, and that’s the law of attraction. You become what you think about most, but you also attract what you think about most.</em></p>
			<p class="calibre19">Your life right now is a reflection of your past thoughts. That includes all the great things, and all the things you consider not so great. Since you attract to you what you think about most, it is easy to see what your dominant thoughts have been on every subject of your life, because that is what you have experienced. Until now! Now you are learning The Secret, and with this knowledge, you can change everything. </p>

			<p class="calibre19"><em class="calibre3">And that principle can be summed up in three simple words.</em> Thoughts become things!</p>
			<p class="calibre19">Through this most powerful law, your thoughts become the things in your life. Your thoughts become things! Say this over to yourself and let it seep into your consciousness and your awareness. Your thoughts become things!</p>

			<p class="calibre19"><em class="calibre3">What most people don’t understand is that a thought has a frequency. We can measure a thought. And so if you’re thinking that thought over and over and over again, if you’re imagining in your mind having that brand new car, having the money that you need, building that company, finding your soul mate . . . if you’re imagining what that looks like, you’re emitting that frequency on a consistent basis.</em></p>

			<p class="calibre19"><em class="calibre3">Thoughts are sending out that magnetic signal that is drawing the parallel back to you.</em></p>
			<div class="group"><p class="quote1">“The predominant thought or the mental attitude is the magnet, and the law is that like attracts like, consequently, the mental attitude will invariably attract such conditions as correspond to its nature.”</p><p class="quote-name1">Charles Haanel (1866–1949)</p></div>
			
			<p class="calibre19">Thoughts are magnetic, and thoughts have a frequency. As you think, those thoughts are sent out into the Universe, and they magnetically attract all<em class="calibre3"> like </em>things that are on the same frequency. Everything sent out returns to the source. And that source is You.</p>
			<p class="calibre19">Think of it this way: we understand that a television station’s transmission tower broadcasts via a frequency, which is transformed into pictures on your television. Most of us don’t really understand how it works, but we know that each channel has a frequency, and when we tune into that frequency we see the pictures on our television. We choose the frequency by selecting the channel, and we then receive the pictures broadcast on that channel. If we want to see different pictures on our television, we change the channel and tune into a new frequency.</p>
			<p class="calibre19">You are a <em class="calibre3">human</em> transmission tower, and you are more powerful than any television tower created on earth. You are the most powerful transmission tower in the Universe. Your transmission creates your life and it creates the world. The frequency you transmit reaches beyond cities, beyond countries, beyond the world. It reverberates throughout the entire Universe. And you are transmitting that frequency <em class="calibre3">with your thoughts</em><em class="calibre3">! </em></p>

			<p class="calibre19">The pictures you receive from the transmission of your thoughts are not on a television screen in your living room, they are the pictures of your <em class="calibre3">life</em>! Your thoughts create the frequency, they attract <em class="calibre3">like</em> things on that frequency, and then they are broadcast back to you as your life pictures. If you want to change anything in your life, change the channel and change the frequency by changing your thoughts.</p>

			<p class="calibre19">As you think of yourself living in abundance, you are powerfully and consciously determining your life through the law of attraction. It’s that easy. But then the most obvious question becomes, “Why isn’t everybody living the life of their dreams?” </p>
