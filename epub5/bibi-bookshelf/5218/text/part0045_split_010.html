				<ul class="points-of-power">
					<li class="calibre64">Love is not weak, feeble, or soft. Love is the positive force of life! Love is the cause of everything positive and good.</li>
					<li class="calibre64">Everything you want to be, do, or have comes from love.</li>
					<li class="calibre64">The positive force of love can create anything good, increase the good things, and change anything negative in your life.</li>
					<li class="calibre64">Every day, in every moment, you make the choice whether to love and harness the positive force – or not.</li>
					<li class="calibre64">The law of attraction is the law of love, and it is the law that is operating in your life.</li>
					<li class="calibre64">Whatever you give out in life is what you receive back in life. Give positivity, you receive back positivity; give negativity, you receive back negativity.</li>
					<li class="calibre64">Life doesn’t happen to you; you receive everything in your life based on what you’ve given.</li>
					<li class="calibre64">Whether your thoughts and feelings are good or bad, they return as automatically and precisely as an echo.</li>
					<li class="calibre64">People who have great lives think and talk about what they love more than what they don’t love!</li>
					<li class="calibre64">Talk about the good news of the day. Talk about what you love. And bring what you love to you.</li>
					<li class="calibre64">You have an unlimited ability to think and talk about what you love, and so you have an unlimited ability to bring everything good in life to you!</li>
					<li class="calibre64">Love, because when you love you are using the greatest power in the universe.</li>
