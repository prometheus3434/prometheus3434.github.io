<p class="indent">The following passage comes from the Gospel of Matthew in the Holy Scriptures, and it has mystified, confused, and been misunderstood by many people over the centuries.</p>
			<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“Whoever has will be given more, and he will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken from him.”</em></p>
			<p class="calibre2">You have to admit that when you read the passage it appears unjust, as it seems to be saying that the rich will get richer and the poor will get poorer. But there’s a riddle to be solved in this passage, a mystery to uncover, and when you know it a new world will have opened up for you. </p>
			<p class="calibre2">The answer to the mystery that has eluded so many for centuries is in one hidden word: <strong class="calibre7">gratitude</strong>. </p>
			<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“Whoever has <strong class="calibre7"><em class="calibre3">gratitude</em></strong> will be given more, and he or she will have an abundance. Whoever does not have <strong class="calibre7"><em class="calibre3">gratitude</em></strong>, even what he or she has will be taken from him or her.”</em></p>
			<p class="calibre2">By the revelation of one hidden word, a cryptic text is made crystal clear. Two thousand years have passed since those words were recorded, but they are as true today as they ever were: if you don’t take the time to be grateful you will never have more, and what you do have you will lose. And the promise of the magic that will happen with gratitude is in these words: <em class="calibre3">if you’re grateful you will be given more, and you will have an abundance!</em></p>
			<p class="calibre2">From the Koran the promise of gratitude is equally emphatic: </p>
			<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“And (remember) when God proclaimed: ‘If you are grateful I will give you more; but if you are ungrateful verily my punishment is indeed severe.’”</em></p>
			<p class="calibre2">It doesn’t matter what religion you follow, or whether you’re religious or not, these words from the Holy Scriptures and the Koran apply to you and your life. They are describing a fundamental law of science and of the Universe.</p>
