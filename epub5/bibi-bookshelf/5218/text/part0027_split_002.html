				<li value="1" class="calibre9">Count Your Blessings: Make a list of ten blessings. Write <em class="calibre3">why</em> you’re grateful. Reread your list, and at the end of each blessing say <em class="calibre3">thank you, thank you, thank you,</em> and feel as grateful for that blessing as you can.</li>
				<li value="2" class="calibre9">Fill in your Magic Check with the amount of money you want to receive, along with your name and today’s date.</li>
				<li value="3" class="calibre9">Hold your Magic Check in your hands, and imagine purchasing the specific thing you want the money for. Feel as happy and grateful as you can that you have received it.</li>
				<li value="4" class="calibre9">Take the Magic Check with you today, or put it in a place where you will see it often. On at least <strong class="calibre7">two</strong> more occasions, take the check in your hands, picture yourself using the money for what you want, and feel as grateful as though you were really doing it.</li>
				<li value="5" class="calibre9">At the end of today, keep your Magic Check in a prominent place where you will see it daily. When you have received the money on your check, or if you receive the item you wanted to spend the money on, replace the check with a new amount for something else you want, and repeat steps 2–4.</li>
				<li value="6" class="calibre9">Just before you go to sleep tonight, hold your Magic Rock in one hand, and say the magic words, <em class="calibre3">thank you,</em> for the <em class="calibre3">best</em> thing that happened during the day.</li>
