				<li value="1" class="calibre9">Count Your Blessings: Make a list of ten blessings. Write <em class="calibre3">why</em> you’re grateful.

				<li value="4" class="calibre9">Take one person at a time, and hold their photograph in your hand. Close your eyes and for one minute visualize the person’s health, wealth, or happiness has been fully restored, and you’re receiving the news. </li>
				<li value="5" class="calibre9">Open your eyes, and with the photograph still in your hand, say the magic words slowly: “<em class="calibre3">Thank you, thank you, thank you for </em><span class="prompt-line">       Name’s       </span><em class="calibre3"> health, wealth, or happiness.” </em></li>
