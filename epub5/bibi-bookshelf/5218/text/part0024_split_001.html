<p class="quote">“Intentions compressed into words enfold magical power.” </p>

			<p class="indent">To see and experience the most magical day of your life, you can be grateful for your whole day <em class="calibre3">before</em> you live it! To Have A Magical Day, you simply think through your plans for the day and say the magic words, <em class="calibre3">thank you,</em><em class="calibre3"> </em>for each one going well, <em class="calibre3">before</em> you’ve lived it. It’s the easiest thing to do, it only takes a few minutes, but the difference it can make in your day is incredible. Being grateful for your day beforehand creates a magical day through the law of attraction; when you <em class="calibre3">give</em> thanks for the experiences in your day going well, you must <em class="calibre3">receive</em> back experiences going well! </p>
			<p class="calibre2">If you don’t believe you have the power to affect the circumstances of your day so dramatically, think about a time when you woke up grumpy or in a bad mood. You went off into your day, and one thing after another went wrong, until by the end of the day you were exclaiming that you had a heck of a bad day – as though the bad day happened by accident. Well, the only reason you had a bad day was because you took your bad mood from the morning with you, and it was your bad mood that was the cause of one thing after another going wrong. </p>
			<p class="calibre2">Even waking up in a bad mood doesn’t happen by accident, because it means that you went to sleep thinking negatively about something, perhaps without realizing it. It’s the very reason why you are doing the Magic Rock practice last thing at night, to ensure that you go to sleep thinking good thoughts. The Magic Rock practice at night combined with Count Your Blessings every morning sets your good mood at night and in the morning, and they guarantee that you are feeling good <em class="calibre3">before </em>you go off into your day.</p>
			<p class="calibre2">To Have A Magical Day you need to feel good. I don’t know of anything other than gratitude that guarantees to put you in a good mood almost instantly.</p>
			<p class="calibre2">Whatever your plans are for the day today, whether it’s traveling, a meeting, work project, lunch, exercise, dropping off dry cleaning, playing a sport, going to the theater, meeting a friend, yoga, cleaning your house, going to school, or buying groceries, turn today into a magical day by saying the magic words, <em class="calibre3">thank you,</em> for each plan going well – <em class="calibre3">before </em>you live it! If you’re a person who writes daily lists of things you need to do, then you can go through your daily list and be grateful for each one having gone well. Whether you do this magical practice in your mind or on paper, the most important thing is that you feel the result of each plan or activity was the <em class="calibre3">best</em> it could have been. </p>
			<p class="calibre2">When you use gratitude ahead of time to Have A Magical Day it wipes out unexpected problems or difficulties before they happen. The more you use this magical practice, the better your days will become, and from the smallest things to the important things, everything starts going well in your life. The bumpy days smooth out, and instead of frustrating or troublesome things happening in your day, your days start to have a magical flow about them, and things seem to magically go your way, with less effort, no worry, no stress, and far more joy. </p>
			<p class="calibre2">When I first began to use gratitude to Have A Magical Day, I chose to give thanks ahead of time for the events in my day that I didn’t enjoy doing very much. One of those things was going to the supermarket. At the beginning of the day I said the magic words: “Thank you for the easy and joyful trip to the supermarket.” I had no idea how a trip to the supermarket could be easy and joyful, but I felt as much gratitude for that outcome as I could. </p>
			<p class="calibre2">The result of gratitude’s magical power was that I got a parking space right at the door. I then ran into two friends. One friend I hadn’t seen for a long time, and we got together for lunch after shopping. The second friend I ran into told me about an amazing and inexpensive house cleaner, which was something I had been dreaming of having. As I did my supermarket shopping, wherever I looked, what I needed was magically in front of my eyes; everything was in stock on the shelves; one item after another was on special; and as I approached the checkout after doing my shopping in record time, a new aisle opened, and the checkout person signaled me to them. As the checkout person was putting my items through the register, out of the blue she asked, “Do you need any batteries?” It was the one item I had forgotten to buy! My trip to the supermarket was beyond easy and joyful – it was downright magical!</p>
			<p class="calibre2">It only takes a few minutes in the morning to use gratitude to Have A Magical Day by giving thanks for the events in your day ahead of time, but this one practice alone will change the way your entire day unfolds.</p>
			<p class="calibre2">To Have A Magical Day, when you wake up to the new day, either before you get out of bed, or while you’re showering or getting dressed, think about your plans for the day, and give thanks for each one going brilliantly well. Make sure you do this magical practice at the beginning of your day and in one session. In your mind, work your way through the plans you have for the morning, afternoon, and evening, until bedtime. With each plan or event, say the magic words and imagine that you’re saying <em class="calibre3">thank you </em>at the end of the day, and you’re immensely grateful because it did go brilliantly well. </p>
			<p class="calibre2">You can use as many superlatives as you like to help you feel more grateful. “<em class="calibre3">Thank you </em>for the incredibly successful meeting.” “<em class="calibre3">Thank you </em>for the amazing outcome with the phone call.” “<em class="calibre3">Thank you </em>for one of the best days ever at work.” “<em class="calibre3">Thank you </em>for the thrilling sports game.” “<em class="calibre3">Thank you </em>for the effortless and fun day of cleaning.” “<em class="calibre3">Thank you </em>for the great night out with our friends.” “<em class="calibre3">Thank you </em>for the relaxing day of travel.” “<em class="calibre3">Thank you </em>for the amazing energy from my exercise session.” “<em class="calibre3">Thank you </em>for the best family get-together we’ve ever had.” </p>
			<p class="calibre2">This magical practice is more powerful if you can say the magic words, <em class="calibre3">thank you,</em> out loud for each experience, but if you’re not in a position to say them out loud then it is fine to say them in your mind. </p>
			<p class="calibre2">After you’ve finished using gratitude’s magical power for every task and event in your day, end the practice by saying, “And thank you for the great news coming to me today!” Without fail, every single morning when I finish using gratitude to Have A Magical Day, I give thanks for the great news coming to me that day. As a result, I’ve never received so much great news in my entire life. One week after another, one day after another, great news pours in! Each time I receive another piece of great news I am especially grateful and excited because I know I used gratitude’s magical power to bring it, and then even more great news continues to come in. If you want to receive more great news than you ever have before, then just follow in my footsteps. </p>
