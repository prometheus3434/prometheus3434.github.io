<h2 class="calibre8" id="calibre_pb_3">The Universe and You</h2>

			<p class="calibre2">There is a level that you can reach with gratitude that causes <em class="calibre3">unlimited</em> abundance in your life. The way that this level of gratitude is reached is through your relationship with the Universe, or, if you prefer, Spirit or God.</p>
			<p class="calibre2">You can tend to think of the Universe as separate from you, and when you think of it, look up above yourself and toward the sky. While the Universe most certainly is above you, it is also below you, and behind you, and beside you, and it is within every single thing and every single person. That means the Universe is <em class="calibre3">within</em> <em class="calibre3">you.</em> </p>

			<p class="quote">“As below, so above; and as above so below. With this knowledge alone you may work miracles.”</p>
			<p class="quote-name">THE EMERALD TABLET (circa 5,000–3,000 BC)</p>

			<p class="calibre2">When you understand that the Universe is <em class="calibre3">within</em> you, and by its very nature it is <em class="calibre3">for</em> you, wanting you to have <em class="calibre3">more</em> life, <em class="calibre3">more</em> health, <em class="calibre3">more</em> love, <em class="calibre3">more</em> beauty, and <em class="calibre3">more</em> of everything you want, then you will feel genuine gratitude to the Universe for <em class="calibre3">everything</em> you receive in your life. And you will have established a personal relationship between you and the Universe. </p>
			<p class="calibre2">The more genuine gratitude you feel toward the Universe for everything you receive, the closer your relationship becomes with the Universe – and that is when you can reach the level of <em class="calibre3">unlimited </em>abundance from the magic of gratitude.</p>
			<p class="calibre2">You will have opened your heart and mind completely to the magic of gratitude, and with it you will touch the lives of everyone you come into contact with. You will become a friend of the Universe. You will become a channel for unlimited blessings on Earth. When you get up close and personal with the Universe, when you feel that closeness of the Universe within you, from that moment on, the world will belong to you, and there will be nothing that you cannot be, have, or do! </p>
