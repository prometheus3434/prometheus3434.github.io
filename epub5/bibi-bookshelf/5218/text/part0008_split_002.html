<h2 class="calibre8" id="calibre_pb_3">It’s Universal Law</h2>

			<p class="calibre2">Gratitude operates through a Universal law that governs your whole life. According to the law of attraction, which governs all the energy in our Universe, from the formation of an atom to the movement of the planets, “like attracts like.” It’s because of the law of attraction that the cells of every living creature are held together, as well as the substance of every material object. In your life, the law operates on your thoughts and feelings, because they are energy too, and so whatever you think, whatever you feel, you attract to you. </p>
			<p class="calibre2">If you think, “I don’t like my job,” “I haven’t got enough money,” “I can’t find my perfect partner,” “I can’t pay my bills,” “I think I’m coming down with something,” “He or she doesn’t appreciate me,” “I don’t get along with my parents,” “My child is a problem,” “My life is a mess,” or “My marriage is in trouble,” then you must attract more of those experiences. </p>
			<p class="calibre2">But if you think about what you’re grateful for, like, “I love my job,” “My family is very supportive,” “I had the best vacation,” “I feel amazing today,” “I got the biggest tax refund ever,” or ”I had a great weekend camping with my son,” and you sincerely feel the gratitude, the law of attraction says you must attract more of <em class="calibre3">those</em> things into your life. It works in the same way as metal being drawn to a magnet; your gratitude is magnetic, and the more gratitude you have, the more abundance you magnetize. It is Universal law! </p>
			<p class="calibre2">You will have heard sayings like, “Whatever goes around comes around,” “You reap what you sow,” and “You get what you give.” Well, all of those sayings are describing the same law, and they’re also describing a principle of the Universe that the great scientist Sir Isaac Newton discovered.</p>
			<p class="calibre2">Newton’s scientific discoveries included the fundamental laws of motion in the Universe, one of which says: </p>
			<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Every action always has an opposite and equal reaction. </em></p>
			<p class="calibre2">When you apply the idea of gratitude to Newton’s law it says: every action of <em class="calibre3">giving</em> thanks always causes an opposite reaction of <em class="calibre3">receiving</em>. And what you receive will always be equal to the amount of gratitude you’ve given. This means that the very action of gratitude sets off a reaction of receiving! And the more sincerely and the more deeply grateful you feel (in other words, the <em class="calibre3">more</em> gratitude you give) the <em class="calibre3">more</em> you will receive. </p>
