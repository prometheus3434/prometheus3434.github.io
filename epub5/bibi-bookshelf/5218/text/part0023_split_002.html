<h2 class="calibre8" id="calibre_pb_3">What Do You Most Want Right Now? </h2>

			<p class="calibre2">At the beginning of this book I asked you to get really clear about what you want in every area of your life. (If you didn’t do that earlier, now is the time to do it.) Go to the lists you created now, and choose your top ten desires for this magical practice. You can select ten desires from different areas of your life, such as money, health, home, and relationships, or you might want to choose ten desires in one area you really want to change, such as work or success. Be very clear and specific about what you most want, so that you can see the changes magically happen from this practice. Imagine you are putting in a magic order with the Universe for your top ten desires, because in truth, by using the law of attraction, that’s exactly what you are doing. </p>
			<p class="calibre2">Sit down at a computer or with a pen and journal, and create a separate list of your top ten desires in the following way, <em class="calibre3">as though you’ve received them:</em> </p>
			<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Thank you, thank you, thank you for </em><span class="prompt-line">              </span>, and fill in the blank with your desire as though you’ve received it. For example:</p>
			<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Thank you, thank you, thank you for the high marks in my exam results, which got me into the exact college I wanted! </em></p>
			<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Thank you, thank you, thank you for the great news that we are having a baby!</em></p>
			<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Thank you, thank you, thank you for our dream home, which has everything we wanted it to have down to the last detail!</em></p>
			<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Thank you, thank you, thank you for the amazing phone call with my dad that has improved our relationship!</em></p>
			<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Thank you, thank you, thank you for the medical results that show I am all clear, and healthy again!</em></p>
			<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Thank you, thank you, thank you for the unexpected money I received, which is the exact amount I needed for my European trip!</em></p>
			<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Thank you, thank you, thank you for the doubling of our sales figures this month!</em></p>
			<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Thank you, thank you, thank you for the ideas that won us our biggest client yet!</em></p>
			<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Thank you, thank you, thank you for my perfect partner!</em></p>
			<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Thank you, thank you, thank you for how easy and effortless our move was!</em></p>
			<p class="calibre2">Writing thank you three times in a row is a powerful thing to do because it prevents you from throwing the words away, and increases your focus of gratitude. Saying <em class="calibre3">thank you </em>three times is also a magic formula, because it is the mathematical number of all new creation in the Universe. For example, it takes one male and one female to create a baby. The male, female, and baby total three, completing a new creation. The same rule of three applies to the creation of everything in the Universe, including the creation of your desires, and so when you say <em class="calibre3">thank you </em>three times in a row, you are using the magic number of creation, and a secret magic formula! </p>
			<p class="calibre2">The second step of Make All Your Wishes Come True involves saturating your desires with even more gratitude. You can complete the second step at any time during the day today, either at the same time as listing your top ten desires, or intermittently throughout the day. </p>
			<p class="calibre2">To saturate each of your desires with gratitude’s magical power, begin with the first desire on your list and using your imagination mentally answer the following questions, as though you’ve received your desire:</p>

			<ol class="no-italic">
				<li value="1" class="calibre9">What emotions did you feel when you received your desire?</li>
				<li value="2" class="calibre9">Who was the first person you told when you received your desire, and how did you tell them?</li>
				<li value="3" class="calibre9">What is the first great thing you did when you received your desire? Include as much detail as you can in your mind.</li>
			</ol>

			<p class="calibre2">Finally, reread each desire, and really emphasize the magic words, <em class="calibre3">thank you,</em> so that you feel them as much as you can. </p>
			<p class="calibre2">Move on to the second desire on your list, and follow the same steps with each desire, until you’ve completed all ten desires. Spend at least one minute on each desire. </p>
			<p class="calibre2">If you want to do something that’s really powerful and a lot of fun, you can also create a Magic Board, where you attach pictures of your desires. Cut out the pictures and attach them to a board that’s in a place where you will see it often. Place the magic words <strong class="calibre7">THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU</strong><em class="calibre3"> </em>in big bold letters on your Magic Board. Or you can use your refrigerator as your Magic Board. If you have a family, you can create a Magic Board as a family project, because children love it! Imagine that your Magic Board is truly magical, and that whatever you place a picture of on your board is instantly being moved toward you. Your continued gratitude for it will magnetize it all the way into your life. </p>
