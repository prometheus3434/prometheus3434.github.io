			<p class="calibre2">Take gratitude with you wherever you go. Saturate the magic of gratitude into your passions, encounters, actions, and life situations to make all your dreams come true. In the future, if life presents you with a challenging situation that you think you have no control over, and you’re at a loss as to what to do, instead of worry or fear, turn to the magic of gratitude and be grateful for <em class="calibre3">everything else</em> in your life. When you deliberately thank the goodness in your life, the circumstances around the challenging situation will magically change.</p>

			<p class="quote">“We showed him (i.e. man) the way: whether he be grateful or ungrateful (rests on his will).”</p>
			<p class="quote-name">KORAN (al-Insân 76:3)</p>

			<p class="calibre2">Say the magic words, <em class="calibre3">thank you.</em> Say them out loud, shout them from the rooftops, whisper them to yourself, say them in your mind, or feel them in your heart, but wherever you go from this day forward, take gratitude and its magical power with you. </p>
			<p class="calibre2">To have a magical life filled with abundance and happiness, the answer is on your lips, it is inside your heart, and it is ready and waiting for you to bring forth <em class="calibre3">the magic!</em></p>
