<p class="indent">You are the builder of your life, and gratitude is your magical tool to build the most incredible life. You have now laid a foundation through these magical practices, and with the tool of gratitude, you are adding more floors to the building of your life. Your life will climb higher and higher, until you touch the stars. There is no end to the heights you can reach with gratitude, and there’s no end to the magic you can experience. Like the stars in the Universe, it’s infinite!</p>

			<p class="quote">“To speak gratitude is courteous and pleasant, to enact gratitude is generous and noble, but to live gratitude is to touch Heaven.”</p>
			<p class="quote-name">Johannes A. Gaertner (1912–1996) <br class="calibre1"/><em class="calibre6">PROFESSOR, THEOLOGIAN, POET</em></p>

			<p class="calibre2">The ideal way to move forward from here is to maintain the foundation of gratitude you’ve built, and gradually keep building on it through increasing your depth of feeling. The more you practice gratitude, the deeper you will be able to feel it, and the more deeply you feel it, the less time you will need to give to it. As a guide: </p>
			<p class="calibre2">Three days a week of Remember The Magic, or combining it with two other magical practices of your choosing, should maintain your current foundation of gratitude, and keep building the magic in your life so that your life continues to get better and better. For example, you might choose to do Remember The Magic on one day, Magical Relationships on the second, and Magic Money on the third day.</p>
			<p class="calibre2">Four days a week of Remember The Magic, or incorporating it with three other magical practices of your choosing, will maintain your gratitude <em class="calibre3">and</em> accelerate the magic.</p>
			<p class="calibre2">Five days a week of Remember The Magic, or incorporating it with four other magical practices of your choosing, will dramatically increase your happiness and the magic in every area and circumstance of your life.</p>
			<p class="calibre2">Six or seven days a week of Remember The Magic, or incorporating it with any other magical practices of your choosing, and you will become the true alchemist, who can turn everything into gold!</p>
