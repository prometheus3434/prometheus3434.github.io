<p class="indent">I practice gratitude every day of my life, and it’s inconceivable to me now that I could have lived days, months, and years without practicing gratitude in some way every day. Gratitude has become a part of my personality, it is in my cells, and it’s a pattern in my subconscious mind. </p>
			<p class="calibre2">But if we get caught up in life and forget to practice gratitude, over a period of time, the magic will evaporate. I use the magic in my life as my guide to let me know if I’m practicing gratitude enough, or if I need to practice more. I watch my life carefully, and if I find that I’m not feeling as happy, I increase my practice of gratitude. If a few little problems start appearing in a particular area of my life, immediately I increase the magical practices of gratitude in that area. </p>
			<p class="calibre2">I’m not blinded by false appearances anymore. Instead I look for the goodness to be grateful for in every circumstance, <em class="calibre3">knowing</em> that it’s there. And then, like a puff of smoke, what was unwanted magically disappears!</p>

			<p class="quote">“I started out giving thanks for small things, and the more thankful I became, the more my bounty increased. That’s because what you focus on expands, and when you focus on the goodness in your life, you create more of it. Opportunities, relationships, even money flowed my way when I learned to be grateful no matter what happened in my life.” </p>
			<p class="quote-name">Oprah Winfrey (B. 1954) <br class="calibre1"/><em class="calibre6"> MEDIA PERSONALITY AND BUSINESSWOMAN</em></p>

			<p class="calibre2">Through the practice of gratitude you are using an infallible law of the Universe; it is a gift from the Universe to you, and it exists in order for you to<em class="calibre3"> use it </em>and advance your life.</p>
